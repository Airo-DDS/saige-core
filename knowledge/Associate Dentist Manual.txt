A fulfilling team culture that is engaged with our community through acts of service and provides a welcoming/empathetic patient experience through genuine patient and team relationships.

A team culture that is safe and relaxed allows for connectedness and fulfillment. We have each other’s back, communicate clearly, and ALWAYS assume the best. We take responsibility for our actions and the results that we create. We bring good vibes because the way we show up to the world is a choice and our goal is to have a positive impact on each other’s experience.

We strive to make our community a better place. We will do this through donations of time, money, and supplies to those in need. We will engage and educate. Our community knows that we are approachable, available, and determined to have a positive impact.

Our patients feel seen, valued, and heard because we lead with empathy and seek to understand. Rich relationships are foundational. Patients say their experience at our office is refreshingly different.

We are a dynamic business always on the forefront, paving our own way as we embrace new ideas and work through complex problems. We are a financially healthy organization that strives for efficiency and leads with integrity.

# Green Dental Care: Standards of Service

- We always give post-op instructions
- We always edify our teammates
- Every new patient sees the new patient slide show
- We ask for a referral or a review when we receive a compliment (SEND VIA Swell) (NOTE in the patient note section of Open Dental after we have done so in order to ensure we do not ask the same patient the same thing every time)
- Every patient that receives anesthetic receives a post-op call
- Every new hygiene patient receives a welcome call from the hygienist
- Every patient is greeted as they walk in the door (even if we are on the phone)
- Introduce yourself, invite the patient to follow you back & ask how their day is going
- We are consistent: same level of service every time (try and keep patients with same clinical team members (doctor, hygienist, assistant) whenever possible)
- We track all new patient referral sources
- Offer water or drink while hanging out
- Don’t abandon the patient

# Associate Payroll

Payroll - We run payroll 2 times per month for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons is to avoid payroll months, which tend to throw off overhead and budgeting. Team members are paid on the 15th and 30/31st of the month and the pay periods are based on hours accrued from the 26th -10th of the month & the 11th -25th of the month. This allows the office manager to run payroll on the 26th and 11th of each month with enough buffer for 3 days weekends, bank holidays etc so that the money always hits team members accounts on the 15th and 30/31st.

# Run daily production report in Open Dental

1. Click reports
2. Standard
3. More options under Production and Income category
4. Select your name as provider
5. Check box- “Use initial claim date for write-off estimates, ins pay date for write-off adjustments
6. OK

Associate payroll may depend on your practice management software, your contract and your philosophy. We pay dentists on 30% of collections, they pay ½ their lab bill and we deduct care credit fees. Since they are W2 employees we pay them every 2 weeks with the rest of the team. Doctors are to check and print their production day sheets at the end of the day and manually add $35 for any dental savings plan exams (this is what we allocate for the opportunity to discover treatment on a DSP).
---
patient), then the doctor enters that days total adjusted production on the date. At the end of the pay period the doctor will go back and run the production report for each day to make sure it still matches and then turn in their payroll to the office manager, the office manager will double check their work. Lab bills are accounted for on 1 payroll a month.

# DSP Production Allocation

- Dental Savings Plan production allocation will be based on the discounted rate for a family of 4. DSP patients are cash patients that allow us to get reimbursed at a much higher rate than insurance patients, so take good care of them and make them long term loyal patrons of our practice.
- Most procedures and adjustments for DSP members are a straight 15% discount and very straight forward for calculating your production accurately, this document is intended for allocating production for services provided that are included in the $365/yr membership fee.
- Exams, Regular Cleanings (including up to 2 perio maintenance), X-rays and Fluoride are included in the plan and therefore not a straight 15% adjustment.
- There is no easy way to split this up, we believe this is more than fair, the difference in production and DSP fee goes toward management of the plan and marketing expenses to acquire more NP to the practice.

# Dentist Production

- No production for Limited Exams, Emergency Exams, Additional X-rays needed at emergency appointments (or other complimentary / included DSP services as per the DSP brochure).
- $500 OFF invisalign.
- $4,000 Implant start to finish.
- When a patient comes in For Initial Comp Exam or Periodic Exams (2 per year per patient) you will ADD $35 towards your production for that day and have signed off by Office Manager.

# Hygienist Production

- For each recall you ADD $100 to your end of day production report and have signed by Office Manager, whether or not you took X-rays that day. This is based on the law of averages.
---
Sometimes you will take an FMX, sometimes no x-rays, sometimes just bite wings...we will base your production at $100 for every DSP member recall.

- Remember DSP covers 2 cleanings per year so the production above is for the 2 times per year that the patient has an exam with a dentist.
- For example if you have a perio maintenance patient that comes 4 times per year, 2 of their cleanings are covered with DSP and the other 2 they will pay 15% off of our UCR fee for Perio Maintenance which will go towards your production normally.

# $200 NP special

- Allocate $52 to Doctor Production and $144 to Hygiene production.

# CIGNA INSURANCE - Billing Protocol for Buildup & Crown

If a patient has CIGNA insurance, we cannot bill out for a buildup and crown on the same day, as the buildup will be considered “inclusive of” the crown, and we will not get paid for that service.

# PROTOCOL:

1. Create Treatment Plan
1. Treatment Coordinator will add only the codes D2950 (Buildup) & D2740 (Crown) when creating treatment plans to present to patient.
2. Collect for BOTH services on or before the PREP date appointment.
3. Once Treatment plan has been presented to the patient
1. Add CignaCrownPREP & CignaCrownSEAT codes to patient’s chart.
4. Schedule the PREP Appointment by Including 3 Codes:
1. D2950 (Buildup), D2740 (Crown) & CignaCrownPREP
1. This will block off enough time for the appointment, and indicate to the provider which services to complete as normal.
5. At time of PREP Appointment
1. REMOVE/DESELECT the Crown (D2740) from the appointment BEFORE setting services complete
1. This will prevent our office from billing for the crown on the prep date. The CignaCrownPREP code will still remain attached to the appointment so that we know a crown was done.
2. The Crown (D2740) code should now be moved to the SEAT appointment.
6. Submit Claim for Prep Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2950 ON THE CLAIM
1. D2740 should not be attached to this DOS once appointment is completed.
2. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code.
7. If Collecting the patient portion at time of service on Prep Date
1. DO collect for both Buildup & Crown!
8. Schedule the patient’s Crown SEAT Appointment in 3-4 weeks.
---
1. Include 2 Codes: D2740 (Crown) & CignaCrownSEAT
1. This will indicate that the crown has already been done and we are simply cementing the permanent crown, but we need to BILL for the Crown at this appointment
2. At time of SEAT Appointment
1. KEEP both codes (D2740 & CignaCrownSEAT) selected and Set complete
2. BILL for the crown D2740
3. Submit Claim for SEAT Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2740 ON THE CLAIM
1. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code

# Codes & Terms to Know:

- “Prep Date”
- This is the date that the Buildup and Crown are both “done”, and we would normally bill for both services on the prep date, except when the patient has Cigna insurance! If patient has Cigna, ONLY BILL for the Buildup
- “Seat Date”
- The appointment 3-4 weeks later when the permanent crown is cemented. This is the date to submit the crown if the patient has Cigna insurance!
- D2950 - Core Buildup
- Should always be billed on the “Prep” date
- D2740 - Crown (Porcelain/Ceramic)
- Pt has Cigna INS - Bill on “Seat” date
- Pt has other INS (that pays for crown & bu same day) - Bill on “Prep” date
- CignaCrownPREP - Dummy code to indicate crown service was done but not billed yet
- Attach to “Prep” Date appointment
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance
- CignaCrownSEAT - Dummy code to indicate the correct date to bill for the Crown
- Attach to “Seat” Date appointment in addition to Crown (D2740)
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance

# On Call Phone Protocol

(Weekend phone coverage)

Let's take care of our patients even when we are not at the office. The best way we can do this is to have a rotation. This is for weekends because typically we are open 5 days a week:

1. Return Emergency & New Patient Calls (many people call to change appointments or with account questions, anything like this is to be addressed first thing Monday morning)
2. Sunday Night: send a slack message to “weekend on call” thread with a call summary

Here are some tips to making this as easy as possible:

- Phone rotates between Doctors & OM
- - Each person is on call for 1 month

Let calls go to voicemail. Return call if VM says it is a toothache or New Patient
- Check Mango Voice every 2-3 hours (login info)
- If New Patient, guide them to fill out Flexbook to schedule an appointment from our website and tell them we will follow up with them on Monday.
- If Emergency/Toothache patient
---
- First determine if it is a true emergency
- If it’s an existing patient that had recent treatment with one of the doctors let the treating doctor know the situation before returning patient’s call so they can guide you as to how to address the issue
- For most situations patient can usually wait until Monday (Ex: re-cements / temps)
- Guide patient to FLEXBOOK to schedule emergency appointment online for Monday: inform them if they are using insurance it is very important to include all of this information on FLEXBOOK (send April email to verify their insurance first thing Monday)
- if no appointments are available Monday morning via FLEXBOOK make arrangements to squeeze them in to the schedule Monday.
- If prescription indicated:
- Gather information:
- Patient name
- Date of birth
- Preferred pharmacy
- Call in prescriptions with following information
- Doctor name, DEA #, office phone number and address
- Patient name and DOB
- Prescription- medication, instructions, quantity, frequency
- Pain: Motrin 800mg or Tramadol (Narcotics cant be called in over the phone)
- Antibiotic:
- (primary) Amoxicillin 500 mg, Dispense 30, take 2 stat and 3 per day until gone
- (secondary if allergic to amoxicillin / penicillin Clindamycin (300mg), dispense 30, take 2 stat and three per day until gone
- (last option) Z-Pack - dispense 1 pack, take as directed
- Follow up with patient in 12 hours to see how prescriptions are working
- On Monday make sure to note in patient chart all pertinent information & what prescriptions were called in
- If it is determined that patient needs to be seen immediately by doctor
- If new patient or existing patient with emergency that is not related to recent treatment performed by our dentists then inform patient that it is a $400 fee to open the office after hours (if it is existing patient in regards to recent treatment and doctor has determined they would like to see patient then $400 will not be charged)
- A staff member will have to accompany doctor, no one should be alone in office with a patient
- For NP or patients that we cannot verify dental insurance: Charge cash fees then work with patient’s dental insurance during office hours and the patient will be reimbursed after insurance payment is settled.
---
- If VM is not pain related and canceling/financial related. Return call first thing Monday morning along with all other missed calls
- Send Summary in Slack of the calls from the weekend so front office knows how to proceed on Monday Morning at 7am

# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

# New Patient without insurance

- Take FMX per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

# Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X Rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 8 Posterior PAs)
- A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional x-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional x-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment, etc.
- If we take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL
- If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X Rays

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim! (Here’s an EXAMPLE for why)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- - The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.

If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA x-rays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA x-rays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X RAYS

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 4 BW-X Rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)

Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 4 BW-X Rays D0272 & Pano D0330

Send of Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X Rays D0272
---
# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X Rays. (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance

Send on Claim: 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY

- If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.
- If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW & 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!
- If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #24).
- NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- Pay careful attention to any note from ins coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to the patient portion.
- This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but may waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
- If deductible applies to all x-rays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect the deductible amount from the patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW x-rays if they are not covered @ 100%.
- If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional x-rays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion
- We take a new FMX every 3-5 years unless needed for a specific reason before then.

# Adult Recare - DUE FOR X-RAYS but NOT Eligible for BW (plan allows only 1x/24 months)

Send on Claim: 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), THREE Addt’l PAs as D0230 (+tooth #)

- In the instance that a plan only allows bitewings once in a 24 month period, some plans (such as Delta Dental) will allow you to take and bill out up to 4 PA x-rays in a visit.
- Hygienists may still choose to take bitewings and 2 PAs as usual, but on the claim, we will bill out 4 PAs
- REMEMBER THAT WITH PAs, The first PA you take will use the code D0220, and ALL ADDITIONAL PAs will use the code D0230.

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)
---
If the patient is due for x-rays and is eligible for a FMX and we have not taken one in 3+ years, delete the BW & PA codes and change to a FMX (D0210).

- Can be due to patients changing insurance, not being eligible for FMX at their very first visit, etc.
- In the past, we used to bill out a FMX and just write it off if not covered by insurance. This may be the case for some patients (usually if their first visit was before the year 2022).

# PANORAMIC X-RAYS - no bill insurance most of the time

- Many times we take a Pano on patients for diagnostic/treatment related reasons (i.e. Wisdom teeth, implants or bridges, ortho, etc.).
- ONLY EVER BILL OUT A PANO TO INS IF IT IS PART OF A FMX COMBO (PANO + 4BW).

We require that payment be rendered on the date of service. We will estimate the amount of copay required from the information that your insurance company provides to us. Please keep in mind that we make every effort that these estimates are accurate, we cannot possibly be correct 100% of the time due to the many clauses and stipulations that are inherent in the individual policies. In other words, every policy is unique, and the estimate is not a contract. In the case that your insurance company pays less than we estimate, you will be responsible for the balance. I understand after 30 days of receipt of a statement from ABC Dental Care, any unpaid balance will incur a 1% per month billing fee. I understand that failure to pay amounts due to this office will result in my account being placed with a collection agency. In the event that my account is further referred to an attorney, I agree to pay all collection and attorney fees.

# Credit Card on File Policy

We strive to provide the highest quality dental care and ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all of our patients. To this end, we have implemented a policy requiring a credit card on file for all patients effective 11/1/2024. We will now start securely collecting a credit card at time of your appointment to streamline payments for copays, deductible, non-covered services, late and no-show fees. We will be notifying families of any balances after insurance payments are received and before we process any transactions. Some insurance plans require deductibles and copayments in amounts not known to you or us at the time of your visit. Much like many other businesses such as a hotel or
---
car rental agency, we now have a similar policy where we ask for a credit card number at the time you check in.

# Circumstances when your card would be charged include but are not limited to:

- Any co-payments, deductible and/or co-insurance not collected from you at your visit.
- Missed or canceled appointments without 48-hour notice (per our Broken Appointment Policy)
- Any non-covered services and/or denial or services allocated to patient responsibility
- Any insurance payments sent to the subscriber/patient instead of to our office
- Outstanding balances greater than 90 days

Please note that patient families will still retain the right to dispute a charge or question your insurance policy’s determination of payment.

By signing below you confirm that you have read our financial policy and consent to us drafting the credit card on file to take care of the unpaid balance less than $150. Before ever charging anything to your credit card in case you would like to make another arrangement.

# Appointment Policy

I understand that because appointments are not double-booked, I must provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. For appointments with a doctor scheduled for 60 minutes or longer, I will be required to make a reservation fee of $100 per hour prior to scheduling the appointment, which will be applied to my out-of-pocket expense for that appointment. This reservation fee is non-refundable. If I do not show up for my appointment or I do not give adequate notice if I am unable to keep my appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited.

For all appointments where a reservation fee is not required, a $129 cancellation fee will apply if I do not provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time.

We understand your lives are busy and as a courtesy to our patients, we reach out via Text, Email and/or Phone to confirm all appointments. It is critical that you respond to confirm your appointment. For any appointments not confirmed 48 business hours prior to your appointment time, we have to assume you are forfeiting that appointment and we will start to open up that valuable time slot to other patients. (FOR EXAMPLE: if your appointment is Monday @ 1pm, you must confirm by Thursday prior @ 1pm.)

# Protocol for When Other Doctor’s Work Needs to be Redone / Is Failing

# Filling or Crown

- Before saying something needs to be redone check the notes, chart, prior x-rays and familiarize with the situation - there’s always a chance it met expectations / expected longevity
- Explain the clinical situation and the reason for needing to redo something.
- Support/back up the Dr that did the work
- Dentistry, like all of medicine, is an imperfect science; complications arise
- “I have seen countless examples of Dr. X’s work doing this very same procedure and I stand by his work 100% of the time, this is an exception and not the norm. He performs this procedure at an extremely high, elite level.”
- We work together as part of a group practice because we believe in each other’s abilities and skills and stand by each other’s treatment
- Come up with a possible reason for the failure/need for re-do without making the Dr look bad.
- Reassure the patient that we will take care of them and we warranty all of our work
- Encourage the patient to schedule with the Dr that did the original treatment
- “Dr. X really knows this clinical situation well, he is really the one that is best qualified to complete the care.”
- Schedule the patient with a corresponding “Renew” code in Open Dental and re-iterate that 100% of the original fee for the procedure will be covered by our office.
- If you are getting the patient to do other work on them, downplay the remake to the patient and make the other doctor aware and redo the treatment for the doctor while you’re doing the other new work on the patient.
- Make a clinical judgment as to the urgency and if it can wait consider waiting and if waiting have the recall with the doctor that did the original work.
---
Mitigate patient expectations by saying, “It’s not real obvious what’s going on here- root canal-treated teeth can flare up from time to time. I want to check with Dr. X (whoever did the RCT) because they’re much more familiar with this particular tooth and in the meantime let’s adjust your bite and get you on antibiotics. Often a root canal-treated tooth needs the help of additional systemic antibiotics later on to completely knock down the infection.”

- Adjust bite and prescribe antibiotics
- Tell the Dr who performed the RCT and they will decide how to proceed
- Monitor, Retreat, extract, or refer to endodontist

# Needle Stick/Exposure Protocol

Any great assistant will hopefully not ever get stuck with a needle. However, sometimes random things happen and any number of employees in the office have had this occur. When it does, the question inevitably arises- What should I do if I get a needle stick or exposure at work?

# Protocol

- Wash needlesticks and cuts with soap and water right away, Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water for 5 mins. Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants for 5 mins.
- Report the incident to your supervisor as soon as possible.
---
- Call Company Care (or your local urgent care clinic) and notify that the staff member is coming for exposure.
- Document the incident at work with time of exposure and if possible leave for labs as soon as possible.
- Notify the source that they will be required to also go in for blood work with the following information for Company Care as well.
- If the source is under IV sedation or if the patient wanted to do PRD drawl we could take the source blood into company care with the exposed patient.
- Staff members should have the Source patients' information ready to go for the exposed patient to take into Company Care (or local Quick Care Clinic that might specialize in workplace injuries).

# Dental Analogies and Ways of Speaking

Since dentistry is a foreign language to many people, it is good to talk in analogies and stories that are relatable to the normal person. This is a good strategy to help the patient gain understanding quickly about what the problem is and what is needed to fix the problem.

# Tooth Fractures

- Having a fracture in your tooth is like driving with a bald tire waiting for a blowout.
- Bulging tire analogy. Everyone knows a bald tire is on a continuum and about to blow. Bulging tires sneak up on you and seemingly have no rhyme or reason.
- "Can't we just put a filling in there again?" Not really. A filling is just what it says it is. You have a cavity, so you remove the decay and now you have a hole. So you fill it with something so you don't get stuff stuck in there. But a filling never strengthens the tooth. The tooth supports the filling. Once you have more filling than tooth, the tooth can no longer support the filling, so we start to see cracks and chips. This typically happens when the filling material is about half of the biting surface of the tooth. (show pt tooth in mirror or I/O pic) Your tooth is well past this point. See these cracks? You're kinda on borrowed time already. Let's fix this before it breaks and we can't restore it.
- A filling will seal the crack temporarily but it’s like using a bandaid to repair a leaking dam....something's gotta give, it's just a matter of time.....really depends on your risk tolerance (again most patients opt to crown).
- A crack in your tooth is no different than a crack in your windshield....it starts off small and eventually spreads until you ultimately have to replace the windshield.....(anchor to tooth loss offer crown).
- Filling vs crown.....”we can fill your tooth....it’ll be cheaper and quicker but it’s temporary and the tooth can still break (goal is to get a no because it’s not the superior treatment option)....or we can crown the tooth: the crown is more expensive (address the elephant in the room) but it will prevent your tooth from breaking in half or causing you pain.
---
method on paper may sound like it sucks but it works well because it addresses the higher cost and elicits the negative emotion associated with pain/infection)

- Fillings and crowns are like tires for your car, you only get so much use out of them before you need to replace them.
- I/O shows crack. Why can't you just do a filling? It’s like putting super glue on a cracked windshield...I don’t know when it's gonna give, but it will give. Hopefully, we can still do a crown on that day and not something more expensive. Should we fix it with a crown today?
- “John do you see this crack right here (IO photo/problem)....cracks can spread into the nerve and cause pain or infection....if they spread below the gums the tooth needs to come out (consequence)....so we place a cap/crown on the tooth to hold it together (solution)” (stop talking: let the patient ask questions, let the left brain analytical go to town while the others typically accept treatment)
- Everyone’s practice philosophy varies. I don't wanna step on any toes here, I have found amalgam removal to be a controversial topic....but we remove almost all amalgam fills.....the majority have cracks in the teeth. “These fillings are metal and they contain mercury in them...just like the old thermometers....they used mercury in the thermometers because it was so sensitive to temperature changes....when the filling heats up in your mouth it expands.....it’s like driving a small wedge into the tooth and causes little cracks (we use our hands and IO photos to demonstrate.....when it cools it contracts and causes leakage....again using marginal defects in IO photos to demonstrate)

# Hygiene

- The gum therapy can remove the plaque clinging to your teeth like barnacles on a ship, but that plaque was also touching your gums. Instead of cutting away your gums with a sharp surgical blade, we use a laser light to zap just those diseased areas to increase healthy gum formation and decrease sensitivity. -- It's like using a knife to get the peanut butter out of a jar, you can really get a lot, but we all know there's some sticking to the sides that will never come out. That's what the laser does for us.
- I like that I use a similar saying for cleanings. I let them know your cleaning is like your oil change. I can give you a Bentley but it’s not going to last 200k miles if you beat it up and don’t get your scheduled maintenance
- I also use “barnacles on a boat” to describe calculus. You can’t just pull a barnacle off a boat, you have to use an instrument to physically scrape it off. It’s the same for the hardened bacteria under your gums... a regular cleaning won’t take it off but the hygienists can remove it with special instruments.
- I always relate periodontal health to the foundation of a house. “We need to make sure the ‘foundation’ is healthy and strong before concentrating on the teeth that use the bone for support”

# Bruxism

- Tooth is like a pumpkin: hard outer layer, softer inner and then the goop in the middle..the hard outer layer is enamel, the softer inner we call dentin and the goop in the middle is the
---
Nerve....you have worn your teeth down to the softer second layer.....getting closer to the nerve (show them in a mirror, use IO photos, and have them bring the teeth together to line up the wear facets while looking in a mirror. This is powerful): this can be used to discuss night guards, ortho (functional aspect), and potentially crowns if the clinical situation calls for it.

Tooth is like an MandM and they've worn past the CandyShell and now they're into the soft chocolate.

# Immediate dentures

I am making your new plate to fit your current jaw and I’ll have to make some guesses. Say your jaw is like your feet. The day I extract the teeth, if your jaw is a size 11.5, the denture has to be at least a 12 for me to fit it in. After a few months, it will be a 10 or maybe an 8. Then we can with reline it which is like putting more socks on, or remake it to fit better.

Immediate denture is like putting from 100 feet. We will get it closer, but no way we aren't going to need to putt again.

For females, I say dentures are like a wedding dress and multiple fittings before the big day, as your gums heal and change so will the fit of your dentures. You’ll need a couple of fittings over time until it’s just right.

# Root canals

I use this when patients ask why a crown is necessary after a root canal - Ever touch a tree that lost its water supply? The bark just comes off and crumbles. That’s the same as a root canal treated tooth. You not only remove the nerve but also the blood vessels. And just like the tree the tooth will crumble so let’s put that protective cover on the tooth.

A root canal treated tooth is like a tree stump that’s been hit by lightning.....it’s dead, dry and brittle....It’s roots are still there and anchored but it’s fragile.....(pcss and recc crown).

# Ortho

When patient only wants to do one arch: That’s like only changing one shoe at a time, you won’t walk properly and over time, you may never walk properly again without surgery.

Occlusal issues and force distribution problems: Like the front end of your car being out of alignment. Minor situations, your tires wear early, moderate, your wearing bearings and struts, severe, your steering wheel is shaking while you drive down the road. Support conversation with IO of abfraction enamel crazing wear facets and radiographs of joint wear.

IPR - we gently smooth the rough sides of some of the teeth to create spaces as thick as a contact lens so all your teeth can line up like soldiers.

# Sleep Apnea

Cpap is using air to blow and keep the tube open. An oral device is like a car jack to keep your tongue from closing the hole.

# Onlays
---
It’s like a perfectly fitting puzzle piece made of tooth colored material that replaces the broken part of your tooth. And it lasts longer than fillings made of plastic.

# Treatment planning

The way I see it is you’re driving and I'm navigating. We'll go as quickly or as slowly as you want to go, and I'll keep you away from any major pitfalls. We can get right to where we want to go or take the scenic route. It doesn't matter to me.

I always say that teeth are like a 30 year roof...at some point you will probably have a couple of leaks.

# Crowns

(always use an intraoral photo of the patients tooth that is recommended for a crown)

“You see this tooth here Mrs. Jones, I want you to know I am concerned about this tooth and I am concerned because with the size of this filling here the tooth is very susceptible to fracturing and I don’t want you to have a dental emergency where the tooth breaks and we have to do a root canal or even worse if it breaks so bad we have to extract it.”

Wait and listen “so what do we need to do?”

“Mrs. Jones, I would recommend that we put a crown or a cap on this tooth to protect it from breaking. You see a crown will cover the tooth 360 degrees, a crown is the artificial replacement of the enamel outer surface of your tooth and it looks and feels just like your tooth but it will strengthen it.”

# Root Canal, Build Up, Crown

“When you have pain from a tooth it is either because there is a cavity in the nerve, an infection from the tooth or gums or a cracked tooth. A root canal is done to get you out of pain and help you keep the tooth. In each tooth there are main nerves like the trunks of a tree and then a bunch of tiny branches that extend from them. We clean out and fill the nerve so that...

# Fillings

“Sensitivity following tooth colored fillings is completely normal. Many times teeth are not sensitive at all, but it is very common for one tooth or a few teeth to be sensitive to chewing and hot and cold for a few weeks up to several months, it WILL get better with time.”

“If your bite feels off we would like to see you to adjust your bite, if the bite is ok just know it will get better with time.”

# Implant vs. Bridge

https://blueskybio.com/pages/bio-view-patient-treatment-videos

# Oral Sedation

(When sedation is required we use oral sedation 99% of the time. Oral Sedation works great for wisdom teeth extractions, implants, root canals, anxiety. If a patient insists on IV sedation that is perfectly fine we can bring a dental or nurse anesthesiologist in for $600 for the first 90...
---
minutes then $50 for every 15 minutes after that. Our primary contact for IV sedation is Royce Fishell he can be reached at 303-921-3181 option to is Shaheen Moezi 702-682-6799.

# Oral Sedation

“Most of our patients with anxiety or patients that need a longer procedure done find oral sedation to really work well. With oral sedation you’ll have a family member drive you here and take you home, we will give you all of the instructions but we ask you to fast for 8 hours then we have you get here an hour early we get you nice and comfy, all set up with a movie on netflix and give you some medicine that you take by mouth. Once it kicks in you don’t care that we are doing dental work on you and most people don’t even remember the procedure. Oral sedation is very safe because you are still conscious. You aren’t necessarily asleep but you are so relaxed that you will doze in and out.”

# Night Guards: Bruxism / Recession / Abfractions / Sensitivity

“Many people grind their teeth, in fact a lot of us here at the office wear night guards for that reason. In your case you are showing signs of clenching and grinding, a night guard will act like a shock absorber so you aren’t putting so much force on your teeth and jaw joints. Clenching and grinding leads to recession and sensitivity and even chipping of your teeth at the gumline. Some people grind during the day while driving, working out or working on the computer, but most people also clench and grind in their sleep and aren’t even aware of it.”

# Hygiene Explanations

# Gingivitis:

“Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. I am getting some measurements that are reading 4mm. This means the tissue is red, inflamed and swollen. Bleeding is also a sign of bacteria under the gum line that we need to clean out. There could be certain points in your cleaning that it is a little bit uncomfortable, but we would like to get the inflammation down and the bleeding to lessen. If we don’t then we might need to do a deep cleaning.”

# Periodontal Disease:

“Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. 4mm pockets are considered gingivitis and 5mm and above are considered periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is bacteria underneath the gum line that causes bleeding and bone loss. We can try to prevent the pockets and bone loss from getting worse. The bone unfortunately will not grow back, but the pockets and tissue health can improve.”

“Periodontal disease is sort of like having a bleeding-infection the size of your fist, but in your mouth around all your teeth. If you had that on your arm, you’d run to the doctors office right away, but since you can’t see it in one spot, sometimes it’s easy to say, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

SRP:
---
A deep cleaning consists of getting numb to perform a thorough cleaning. We go under the gum line to the bottom of the pocket and clean out the bacteria and build up. We are hoping for less inflammation, bleeding and reattachment of the pockets.

Once we are finished with the deep cleaning we like to have you come back for maintenance cleanings more regularly to see how the pockets are healing and monitor the bone loss.

# Arestin:

Arestin is a localized antibiotic that is placed into a deeper pocket to help get rid of the bacteria and help heal the pocket back to a healthy measurement. It is a powder that adheres to the tissue and it stays down in the pocket for 28 days, you can floss and waterpik like normal but do not be too vigorous in that area.

# Cavitron:

This is a tool that looks like all of my other instruments but it uses vibration and water to help me clean your teeth. It is great because it flushes out some of the bacteria underneath the gum line and vibrates the build up off. It uses less pressure than traditional instruments so most patients like it better. If there is sensitivity please let me know.

# Whitening Trays:

We make whitening trays here in the office. We do impressions of your mouth and make trays that are custom to your teeth. Once we take the impressions you can come back and pick up your trays the following day if the office is open. For optimal whitening you can whiten everyday or every other day for a week or two until desired whiteness. Then you can keep the trays for touch ups down the road. You just need to put a dot of whitening gel in each tooth that you can see in your smile and leave the trays in for about an hour. It is normal to have some sensitivity after whitening.

# Recession/ Abfractions:

Areas of recession are located where the gum line and teeth meet. These areas are exposing the root surface of the tooth. The root surface is not as strong as the enamel which is the part of the tooth that we see and can be very sensitive. These areas are mainly caused by clenching and grinding. It is like a fence post, if the soil is here and you keep moving the board back and forth the soil around the bottom will start to move away and make the board loose and not stable in the ground. It is the same with our teeth. If we keep “knocking”, so clenching and grinding, our gums and bone will start to recede.

(To help this problem I would recommend a night guard and fluoride. The night guard will help the wear on your teeth and the fluoride will help the areas of exposed root surface from getting decay and will also lessen sensitivity.)

# Fluoride

We recommend fluoride to all of our patients because it has so many benefits for keeping your teeth strong and healthy. Fluoride helps prevent any new cavities and protect your
---
Current fillings and crowns, it also helps with any sensitivity especially in areas of recession. The areas of recession are also more prone to decay because it is not as strong as the enamel. It looks like it’s only 25 for today if you want to take advantage of the fluoride treatment.

It is a good idea to train on all these and all have the same verbiage around how to speak to patients. One of the big keys for patients to accept our treatment is to make sure they have a clear understanding of what is needed. Making sure you speak the same way about the same procedures will help them understand the treatment needs - and thus accept treatment more often.

# Tips for Success (Review this list with Dr. G)

- Show up on time, lead by example with the team and they will perform better for YOU
- PREPARE for the day- don’t be lazy “what got you here won’t get you there”
- Come prepared to huddle - review your patient charts for the day and look for opportunities
- Don’t leave right after “your” patients are done, one your EOD checklist is completed, ask the team what you can do to help close
- Be humble, ask lots of questions, seek out mentorship, bring cases to discuss
- Every 6 months you will see growth as you build your own patient base in the practice but we can deliver the NP volume
- Using EOD sheets & completing to 100%
- Excellent documentation / notes (not only for exams & procedures but also any time you talk to a patient over the phone or by text - protect your license)
- Making your own post op calls will accelerate your growth
- Track your own TX that doesn’t schedule
- Why track KPIs? (what gets measured gets managed)
- The more you work the more you’ll make
- PRR restorations (often No anesthetic needed)
- Sealants on kids ...
- Add lingual and buccal
- Do a build up whenever you can and take quality photos
- Taking quality photos of any tooth you’re doing a crown on so we can substantiate to insurance in case they deny it - take the pictures from angles that make it look worse
- Almost Never do 1 filling - always look for something to add
- Be more aggressive adding surfaces on someone that is prone to interprox decay
- Quadrant dentistry (remember 4 fillings is equivalent to a crown in production)
- How to prioritize treatment
- Efficiency and moving from room to room in the most efficient order (thinking ahead)
- How to use the white board ...
- Review crown prep technique with Dr G
- Effective Anesthetic thought process & techniques

- Handling Multiple endo’s at same time
- Immediate implant techniques
- Efficient single tooth implant placement
- Thirds
- Efficiency with complex extractions
- Same day extraction bridge
- Using IO photos to the max benefit
- Night guards and quick splints
- Setting up the TCs for success
- Use treatment coordinators for bigger cases until you get more comfortable closing cases yourself with hygiene
- Use crystal clear communication to patient and Treatment Coordinator
- Double ck exam sheet to make sure everything was captured accurately
- NDTR - repeating and speaking over patients
- Planting seeds for the future and capitalizing on previously planted seeds
- Verbiage - crown, missing tooth, class 2, PRR, night guard
- Blue sky bio videos
- Hygiene Co-Diagnosing
- How to quickly build rapport and trust - how to have a comfortable & not awkward chairside manner
- New patient exam verbiage: hit on a few non-Dental questions (so how long have you been in parker, I heard Mrs Jones referred you we just love her, do you have any kids/grandkids, what are you up to for the summer, holidays, weekend, how was your weekend, how’s your day going) so what brings you in today, Carlie tells me you have some sensitivity ... we are definitely going to take a look / address that for you, Let’s start by going through your X-rays and pictures together, then I’ll take a look in your mouth starting with an oral cancer screening following by looking at all of your teeth, how does that sound? Great, feel free to stop me at any time to ask questions
- Marketing - we want to build your authority - come with ideas to promote yourself on our social media page
- Building Speed- Time your procedures - again “what gets measured gets managed” - push yourself to do more- we work better under pressure & time restraints and this is where growth occurs
- Capitalize on emergencies - get the chief complaint done and add any treatment you can in that quadrant - if you can do comprehensive exam that day then say “today we were able to put out some fires, I don’t want to see you have emergencies like this in the future so let’s look at next steps…” “if they only do limited exam then explain how you want to get them
---
- Back for a cleaning and comp exam & make sure they leave with that appointment - it means way more coming from the doctor & makes it way easier on the team to get them scheduled
- After every single appointment look at their chart and re-iterate the next treatment they need and get it scheduled - no one leaves without an appointment - you are constantly thinking a few steps ahead - this is how you keep your schedule full - letting people walk out not knowing or reminding them what the next steps are is a BIG MISTAKE
- Verbiage Edifying EDDAs
- Mention before you prep - “Hey Joe how are you….I’m gonna go ahead and prep these cavities and then Jordyn’s gonna go ahead and get them filled up…”
- Bite Block / Cheek Protector
- How to utilize assistants / EDDA & work chairside with them
- Prepping teeth in a way that allows EDDA to restore
- Never do slot preps
- How Post Op Checks help build relationships and lead to next treatment
- Practice Endo access on Extracted teeth
- No cord impression technique (how / when to do a wash)
- Thought process for not wasting materials
- Use your Intraoral camera to your advantage to communicate all treatment “seeing is believing” - you are also responsible for helping the insurance coordinator with appeals on treatment you’ve performed, great photos will help substantiate the reasoning for crowns and get the insurance company to pay on the treatment
- Review oral surgery, endo, implant carts, cosmetic supplies, photography
- Backing up hygiene on S/RP diagnosis
- Do one on ones with leads & hygiene to get feedback
- Practice hygiene exam flow with hygienists (we have a specific flow - hygienists give you one relationship building fact when you walk in, doctor chit chats and then turns to hygiene and says “so Carlie what do we have going on today…” hygienist gives you a breakdown of what they saw - per co-diagnosing protocol
- NP emergencies do a comp exam whenever possible not limited exam - “Hey Mrs. Jones I understand you’re in today for #3 and that is my first priority, to get that addressed for you, If it’s ok with you I’d like to take a look at any other conditions that may be going on in your mouth and put together a treatment plan / some priorities for the future, but of course today I want to put out the fire with that tooth on the upper right”
- Bringing hygienist in to Probe NP that came through restorative
- Blue sky bio videos & other patient communication documents on desktops
- Dealing with emergency jaw pain or toothache related to bruxism for sinus involvement (no radiographic evidence of a problem) - bite adjustment, Quicksplint Amox.
- Reinforce treatment & post op expectations with patient on the front end
- How to handle when you see work that other docs did in the office that needs to be redone or is not quite ideal… (failing Endo ?)
- When to refer an endo
- When to refer cases to other more senior docs
---
# What Specialists we refer to and when to refer

The team and patients never know if you are in a rush

New doc- needs to quickly get great at exams - speed within 90 days

# New Dentist Clinical Pearls

- You don’t always have to travel and pay a ton for impactful CE
- YouTube, DentalTown, Facebook, etc… for Free CE
- Clinical Mastery Series occlusion courses and how to approach full arch cases.
- Spears courses- Worn dentition and Facially Generated Treatment planning
- Dawson or Pankey- for Occlusion
- Endo- Aaron Nicholas: 1 hour molar Endo/BuildUp/Crown course. Also call your reps for free or inexpensive local courses (take this with a grain of salt)
- Implant CE: (many out there) CSI, Implant Pathways, Dr. Garg, Misch, Blue Sky Bio courses, White cap, Maxi Courses.- this is a very divisive topic amongst docs. Just pick a course and follow through. Also take a hands on course in another country where you will place 30-60 implants in one week. Ie Q-implant (talk to me about negotiating a discount), Garg, and many others.
- Learn how to EXT 3rds. I learned by observing other docs, so I can’t recommend a course here. This has been very lucrative and one of the easier things I get to do now. Learn the anatomy and flap design then start with soft tissue impactions and gradually work your way up to more difficult cases.
- Oral sedation- “Oral Sedation Seminars”. Check with your state’s requirements and find the cheapest course possible to get that license. Then jump into IV sedation.
- Appear professional, brush your teeth, use some mouth wash, then start the consultation.
- Intraoral Camera with 32” or bigger TVs: seeing is believing and quickly builds trust with patients. Ask any doc with great case acceptance if they want their CBCT or intraoral camera for case presentation→ they’ll choose intraoral camera.
- “Guiding Patients to Yes” - Dr. Paul Homoly and his entire CD/audio series. I’ve listened to this at least 5 times
- Be confident, don’t hesitate, don’t hymn and haw, be confident in your diagnosis
- Record your presentations & review, get your verbiage down!

# Procedures

- Same Day Treatment! (we can take care of that today!)--> Have your team trained to get emergencies in right away.
- Time yourself for procedures, get your speed up- Keep this in an excel sheet and track your progress quarterly and discuss with your assistants how you can improve. This will also give the front desk the ability to schedule you efficiently.
---
- Efficient crown prep, temp, impress- if legal in your state, train assistants on how to do temps and any other steps within their training for you.
- Quadrant Dentistry never do single tooth fillings. Take before, mid, and after pictures to show the patient and to hold yourself to a higher standard. It’s humbling to see your work 21x bigger. (if you do a quad of class 2 fillings take an X-ray after placement to check quality control, you’ll be surprised what you see)
- Show the patient what you have done for them because you are so caring, and have the front desk show them the cost and production adjust it off. -- Front desk then asks for the review and sends them the request through your vendor.
- Oral Conscious Sedation- huge practice builder. Ask everyone who needs more than 2k in work if they want to be sedated. They prepay, you do full mouth dentistry, and they are raving fans because they don't remember the appt.
- 3rd Molars
- If you can section a tooth and lay a flap you can learn 3rds
- After age 25 3rd molars are generally tougher, get em early and they’re typically just covered by bone floating in there
- Learn to see the emergency patient, perform the pulpotomy, place an interim filling, reappt for the consultation and completion of the RCT and hygiene apt, without keeping any pre-scheduled patients waiting. Patients love you for getting them out pain and will typically comeback and trust you forever.

# Be Confident

# No Guarantee of Services

Patient understands that today's appointment is a repair on front teeth #8 and #9 and that composite does not bond to veneers. Patient turned down treatment for replacing veneers at this time. No guarantees can or will be given that any work on the pre-selected teeth today will hold up to excessive force or other pressure inducing factors.

Green Dental Care does not provide a warranty on the above work.

# Materials Needed:

- PRF box/Instruments
- Tourniquet (Blue rubber band)
- Cleansing Alcohol Wipe
- Gauze + Tape or Band-aid
- Butterfly and tubing
- 2 Vials for Blood
- Drawing needle (iPRF)
---
Doctor: Use alcohol wipe to sterilize patients arm at blood draw site

- Doctor will then perform a phlebotomy (draw blood from patient) into vacuum sealed vials
- 2+ vials depending on what it will be used for (membrane, sticky bone, plug or all 3)
- Always draw an even number of vials or place an empty vial in the centrifuge for balance

Assistant: IMMEDIATELY take and spin blood in the centrifuge

# PRF Membrane:

- Spin in centrifuge for 10-12 mins at 3300 RPM
- Once ending….let it slow down on it’s own
- There will be 1-2 mm of red blood cells left in the bottom of the vial
- The blood will be separated into 3 components: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
- The fibrin clot/PRF/snot clot can be pulled from the vial with cotton/tissue pliers
---
# PRF Preparation Instructions

1. Separate the white fibrin clot from the red blood cells at the bottom
2. Open PRF box and place clots on slotted underboard
3. Use the press board to flatten down clots into 1mm thick (box has stopper for accuracy) membranes
4. Let sit for 5-7 mins

# PRF Plug (Same as Membrane):

1. Spin in centrifuge for 10-12 mins at 3300 RPM
- Once ending….let it slow down on it’s own
2. Place the fibrin clots inside of the cylindrical tube molds within the PRF box
3. Place the piston on top of the clots
4. Let sit for 5-7 mins
---
# i-PRF:

- Spin blood taken from pt for 3 mins at 1300 RPM
- Doesn’t create the fibrin clot, but still separates the white/red blood cells
- Draw the i-PRF from the vial immediately with a needle and syringe
- NEEDED: Syringe and large diameter needle
- Draw off Top layer
- Mix into bone particulate

# Sticky Bone:

- Perform above protocol to obtain a fibrin clot
- Spin in centrifuge for 10-12 mins at 3300 RPM
- Once ending….let it slow down on it’s own
- There will be 1-2 mm of red blood cells left in the bottom of the vial
- The blood will be separated into 3 components: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
---
- The fibrin clot/PRF/snot clot can be pulled from the vial with cotton/tissue pliers
- Separate the white fibrin clot from the red blood cells at the bottom
---
# Steaky Bone

- Mold the mixed bone and PRF into the shape you would like, or place into the mouth as normal
- Perform protocol to obtain sticky bone
- Manipulate bone into the shape and size needed for the bone graft site.
- (you may even place the sticky bone, and express i-PRF onto the graft to help it morph to the desired architecture in the mouth)
- Once desired shape is obtained
- Express a few drops of the aforementioned i-PRF onto the grafting material, wait a few moments and express a few more drops
- Let i-PRF absorb into grafting material for 5 minutes

# Result:

→

# “Jelly” Steaky Bone

- Spin blood taken from pt for 3 mins at 700 RPM
- Draw the i-PRF from the vial immediately with a needle and syringe
- Add the i-PRF to the bone graft particulate
- Wait 5 min for the mix to become gelatinous.
---
- Fold the material onto itself and shape it to the desired architecture
- Place the graft into the mouth

We found over time that showing a new assistant the above spreadsheet can be overwhelming. As a result we decided for new assistants we want them to get really good at about 5 skills over the first 2-3 weeks then they can add the next 5 foundational skills. We selected these skills based on the thought process “if a new assistant can take these more time consuming, less skill oriented tasks off our more senior assistants plate, then the senior assistant is freed up to perform the higher level skills with more complex procedures.” This helps the office continue to run smoothly. Additionally, newer assistants get up to speed WAY faster by knowing they only have to focus on chunks of skills at a time. Once they have a strong foundation they are able to flourish as they add additional skills to their tool belt. As a dentist, if you’re anything like me, we have so much in our head, we sometimes don’t even know where to start. So let's follow the KISS principle and start here. This is especially valuable when you are in a situation where you may have been short handed and are caught onboarding someone while the senior assistants have less time to train or you are onboarding multiple assistants at the same time. AGAIN some of these skills are ok in the state of Colorado and may not be ok in your state for a dental assistant to perform.

# Discussing Treatment

- BUZZ WORDS: Worse, Painful, Now, More Expensive, Problems

- What are your expectations for today’s appointment?
- Patient’s appreciate an explanation of the procedure to be done
- Patients are visual
- take a HIGH QUALITY intra-oral photo to show the patient the tooth (dry the tooth free of saliva!) take an intra-oral picture of a healthy tooth in their mouth and say this is what a healthy tooth looks like then take a picture of the problematic tooth
- Play a education video
- get a model
- What is it you were looking for when you were in search of a new dentist?
- When patient asks you what do you think is going on…respond… “well I can say for sure, we’ll have to wait for the dentist to know exactly what you need, but it looks like you might need…”
- Most of our Patients choose…
- I’m not going to lie to you, you’ll be very sore, but It’s better than the discomfort you’d have to go through to replace the tooth

# New Patients, Being Proactive and Team Interactions

F-Family

(invisalign interest, already have a nightguard, how do they react to treatment being presented, trouble sleeping/snoring, botox interest or already receiving)

# Patient Experience:

- CBCT-Should be taken on any patient that has missing teeth or interest in implants. Inform the patient the cost of taking the CBCTS.
- This should be done before the Dr. goes in.
- Verbiage: “It would be a great idea to get a 3-d image of your jaw to determine if you are a good candidate for implants. $250.00.”

# Helping Out

- If the phone is ringing, and front office and you are busy, answer the phone.
- If a patient is in the lobby and everyone else is busy, check them in, give them consents and let the front office know if they paid, etc.

# Say this not that verbiage

- Hang out NOT wait
- Insurance friendly/directly contracted/ participate with NOT out of network
- Courtesy NOT discount
- Patient Portion / Responsibility NOT Balance
- NEVER EVER SAY OUR POLICY
- Discomfort NOT pain
- Conservative NOT just/small (“just a small filling”)
- Numb NOT shot
- Most of our patients take advantage of the benefits of fluoride NOT do you usually get fluoride
- Complimentary NOT free
- Appointment change NOT cancellation
- Luckily/thankfully NOT unfortunately
- Verify insurance NOT run insurance
- Let’s go ahead & get you scheduled NOT do you want to get scheduled
- Pre-Collecting - Let’s go ahead and take care of that NOT do you want to…
- Fifty one - o - eight NOT five thousand one hundred and eight
- Directly Contracted NOT out of network
- Benefits NOT insurance
- NEVER EVER EVER TALK ABOUT DELTA PPO vs. PREMIER on a NP call- you can call them back and tell them if you found out it was PPO only

Let me be the first to welcome you to our office

# Q: Are you in network with or Do you take my insurance? (NEW PATIENT)

A: I can absolutely help you with that, how did you hear about us?

A: You can certainly use your insurance, our team will make sure we can utilize your benefits to the fullest

Or

A: Although we are not a preferred provider or directly contracted with your insurance company you can absolutely use your insurance in our practice. We are very insurance friendly and handle all claims on your behalf so that you can utilize your benefits to the fullest.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?
---
A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

Have you ever wondered WHY insurance companies want to direct you to the cheapest dentist out there?

Q: “I’d like to see Dr. Green…” (your enthusiasm for the other doctor is key here!)

A: Dr. Green is booked out the next 9 weeks, (pick a Dr. and use their full name) Dr. Matt Siracusa has been hand selected from hundreds of dentists by Dr. Green, let’s get you in with him, in fact, we’re really lucky to have him, my mom just had some really complex dental work done with him and it turned out great, yup she’s thrilled.

# ADDITIONAL - second degree acknowledgement

A: if I was in your shoes I’d be concerned the experience might be different with another provider, I can tell you we have full confidence in our team and Dr. Matt to continue to provide the great experience you’ve become accustomed to at our office.

# CONTRAST SITUATIONS: Second Degree Acknowledgement

A: I’m really sorry to hear about (your experience: repeat back patient’s problem), If I was in your shoes I’d be just as upset, you were expecting _______, but the result was not what you expected, what a complete inconvenience.

This is not good enough for us, we’re in the caring business and you left feeling you weren’t cared for. Here’s what I’d like to do for you, let’s go ahead and get you back in with Dr. _____ so we can all get on the same page and get this taken care of for you.

I don’t want to see that doctor, I want to see Dr. Green.

I totally get it, I want to get this addressed right away for you so let’s start here…

# Dental Savings Plan

1. Always compare monthly cost
2. No deductible, strings attached
3. No waiting period
4. We offer a perio option as well
5. Pay monthly or annually
6. No binding contract
7. Membership fees cover hygiene visits

# Cancellation Verbiage

This is a negotiation, do not slam the door on the appointment, keep the door open. When they lead with the excuse skip to #2

1. “Ohhh….can I ask what’s going on?
2. “Are you sure there’s no way you can make it?” Insert patient excuse
3. I understand, “I’d really like to find a way to keep you on the schedule today to help you avoid the last minute appointment change fee”
4. “yes we require 48 business hours for any appointment changes to avoid the $50 fee”
---
If they absolutely must cancel

# 5. “Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# First Offense

“Yeah the appointment you had is really prime real estate, but I understand emergencies do happen so I will go ahead and take care of that for you today, but please remember we do appreciate at least 48 business hours notice in the future”

# Second Offense (within 18 months)

“Yeah you had a real prime appointment time, I’m really not supposed to do this, but I’ll go ahead and take care of this a second time”

“To book another appointment a credit card will need to be kept on file in case of another last minute change”

# Third Offense (within 2 years): charge appointment change fee, inform patient DO NOT rebook

“Ok, we will go ahead and collect that appointment change fee and if there’s ever a day you can come in call us the day of and we will let you know if we can squeeze you in”

# NDTR & Relationship Gifting

N: Next Visit - first priority

D: Date for visit - create “urgency”

T: Time - how long can they expect to be here?

R: Recare - for patient and family

“OK Mary, so your next step is to get that upper right tooth fixed, I’d like to see you back next week to complete that. You will be here for about 2 hours for that initial appointment and then back again 3 weeks later for another 40 mins. Please chat with Jodi to get that reserved and to make sure you & the family are reserved for your next cleanings.”

# Relationship Gifting - this is used to transfer patients to ANY other team members

Introduce - state priority - edify TC - let patient know you’re there to help

“Mary, this is Jodi, Jodi you remember Mary from earlier I’m sure. Mary needs to come back for that crown on the upper right, Dr would like to see her next week for that. Mary, Jodi is fantastic and a real pro at what she does - she will review your cost and reserve your appointment with you. If you need anything at all, please let me know, I am here to help you!”

# Omission/Commision

Golden rules: there are 2 rules

1. → Always assume the best (No one wants to suck - and if someone does want to suck then our hiring process is broken)

2. → In the event of any error, Assume the error is one of misunderstanding (so if you make a mistake we are going to assume it’s a misunderstanding)

There are only 2 types of errors (Omission, Commission)

125
---
# Errors of Omission

What does omission mean? - it means something is missing

- Training / Skills
- Understanding
- Resources
- Equipment
- Priorities
- Permission
- Expectations
- Time (Time journal)

Here is the great news about omission, omission is 90% Dr. G’s problem & fault and 10% the team, it is so overwhelmingly my problem & fault that the only reason you even have 10%, you have to tell me if we need any of these things or if we are missing any of these things, if we need training, resources, or a better understanding of what’s going on - so I need your help here, you need to let me or the leads know these things.

Every time you bring me a problem/get crappy results you need to go back to 90-10 principle.

It’s my problem, either I or the leadership team must get resources to help you solve it.

If someone mentions TIME this is a tricky one because it could be me or it could be you.

- If they say “I don’t have time” print them a time journal, ask them to time journal for 3 days. Now I will have info that is actionable.
- If Dr. G sees a task that is taking you an hour but Jack can finish it in 15 minutes, then I want to connect you with Jack so he can fold time for you - I don’t want you to feel the stress of not having enough time.
- Another way this time journal works is we may identify something that someone else is already doing & take it off your list.
- Finally, your time journal could show me that you have way too much on your plate.

Errors of omission are awesome stuff, every time we solve an error of omission, all of our lives and the practice, improves greatly & immediately.

These are the answers to the test, this is my own philosophy, but I want you to know it and I want you to do well, this is an opportunity for us to all get better and I can’t wait for you to bring those errors of omission to me.

If you screw up, it is not a judgment, we are here to support you to get better.

# Errors of Commission

- Coming in late
- Gossip
- Blame
- Choosing to skip something on the checklist
- Lack of responsibility/taking ownership
- Disrespecting peers
- Do not care
---
# Patient Experience & Team interactions Quiz

- Frustrated
- Rude
- Could not be bothered
- Abusing Cell phone
- Complaining about helping patients or other teammates
- “That’s not my job”
- Lies

These are tricky because these are either 100% or 0%

These are things where you have 100% responsibility (all your fault, not my fault), this is scary stuff because this is something someone has chosen to do intentionally.

Example of error of commission: its the end of the day and we have a patient that needs a crown, Dr. Matt picks it up and tells restorative that we’re picking up a crown, and the assistant rolls their eyes and huffs and puffs at them.

This is a problem, that type of response is a choice and it is disrespectful to the patient, Dr. Matt, and the team.

# Week 5 Doctor/Assistant Timing

# Doctor and Assistant Timing

# 8 ways to increase efficiency and reduce stress

Early in my career, my boss, a pediatric dentist, taught me a profound truth. He said, “Linda, every child who comes here has one thought in mind while sitting in our dental chair: ‘When can I go home to Mommy?’ ”

As a dental assistant, dental hygienist, and practice consultant, I would say that same thought is on the mind of all patients, no matter what their age. You may have a good relationship with your patients, and they may seem like they enjoy being with you; but, the bottom line is they all would rather be out pursuing their own lives than be in your office having dental work done. With that truth in mind, I want to discuss eight paradigm shifts which improve efficiency in your clinical area, reduce stress, and keep patients in your office for the shortest amount of time while maintaining quality care.

133
---
# 1. Know how long procedures really take.

At best, many practices guess about the chair time for procedures. I find that dentists often underestimate the time needed for a procedure because they only think about the time they spend with the patient. Assistants, on the other hand, may overestimate the time required for a procedure because they factor in the room setup and break down, the OSHA compliance steps (which take approximately five to seven minutes to complete correctly), lab work, and sterilization of instruments between patients.

Action Step: Take a two-week time audit to determine your true chair time.

# 2. Train assistants in all expanded duties.

The most wasteful time in any dental office is the time when the dentist performs procedures that, by law, an auxiliary could perform. The best dental assistants are generally happiest when they are allowed to perform all tasks that the law allows. Many dentists say they are poor trainers. Time to get over yourself (as Dr. Phil says) and solve the problem. Not solving this one makes you a clinical-efficiency cripple and keeps you from having the best team members in your practice.

Action Step: Get a copy of your state law. Have a meeting with each dental assistant to create a training plan. You may want to consider hiring one of the instructors from a local dental assisting school to come in during her off hours to train your assistants. You could ask your lab tech to teach them to make temporaries or pour great models. See if your favorite orthodontist will let your assistants spend time in his or her practice to learn to take good impressions or to pour and to trim models.

# 3. Shift to a global paradigm of the clinical area.

As a consultant, I have found that dentists and staff members either have a global paradigm or a microscopic paradigm. By global paradigm, I mean they are aware of all the patients in the clinical area and have the ability to understand clinical time management for everyone. This may mean having the office manager periodically walk around and help direct traffic to keep things moving. It may mean the dentist has an assistant place a matrix and etch while he or she either checks a hygiene patient or numbs the next patient on the schedule. Too many dental teams are myopic - they only see what is going on in their own chair. They don’t think about how the entire clinical area is moving patients in and out.

Action Step: Have a staff meeting to discuss a global paradigm of clinical time management. Find a person who will volunteer to get this started. Have everyone agree to listen to the “traffic controller.” Come back together in a staff meeting to make any adjustments or to rotate the person who serves as the traffic director.

# 4. Have the hygienist ready for exams - ASAP.

Unfortunately, many hygienists have a “clean the teeth” paradigm. The first five to 15 minutes of the dental hygiene appointment should be focused on assessment of the patient’s condition. All of the following should be completed and ready for the dentist’s exam ASAP:

- Medical history update
- Oral cancer screening
- Periodontal screening
- Restorative screening, including intraoral camera pictures; review as a co-diagnosis with the patient
---
● Appropriate radiographs to add to the dentist’s ability to diagnose the patient’s condition(s)

● Home care evaluation

Often, a dentist walks into an exam room and the hygienist has not yet taken a radiograph or an intraoral camera picture of a problem tooth (identified by the patient or hygienist). So, the hygienist must take the radiograph, and the patient must wait for the results or, worse yet, a team member must call the patient at a later time to give the patient the results.

Once the assessment is complete, the hygienist has the information she needs to discuss with the patient during the prophylaxis. She is ready for the dentist to examine the patient any time after the first 15 minutes of the appointment. The patient is happy because there is no excessive wait time in the chair.

Action Step: Create your own assessment checklist of what needs to be completed at the beginning of the hygiene appointment. Discuss how the assessments will be communicated to the dentist - i.e., in a talk over the patient, a check sheet for the dentist to view, or a conversation in the hall.

# 5. Everybody supports efficient hygiene exams.

Dental assistants and dentists often dread seeing the hygienists asking for an exam, yet 60 to 80 percent of the dentistry performed in many practices grows out of the hygiene exams. With a new paradigm, the hygienist is interruptible, and the assistant can queue the dentist to go to hygiene when there is a step in the procedure that the assistant can complete (remember, we have trained our assistants to do all the steps they can). The dentist knows when to stop and turn the procedure over to the assistant. Hygienists can signal the dentist once their assessment is complete.

Action Step: Bring the team together to review the suggestions and create a supportive teamwork paradigm to transition the dentist into the hygiene department efficiently.

# 6. No dull diamonds!

I borrow this phrase from Dr. Pete Dawson. Check all equipment and supplies for efficient utilization. Here are a few dull diamonds I frequently see:

- Not enough tray setups to complete a morning of dentistry or dental hygiene. The investment in trays or cassettes reduces stress when someone is out and you can’t sterilize instruments until lunch, or when the assistants are doing their expanded duties and no one has time to be in sterilization.
- Not using disposable burs, prophy angles, impression trays, diamonds, etc. To squeeze one more use out of some items or to have the staff spend time cleaning out old impression material is inefficient and stressful. Even the best sterilization system dulls sharp things.
- Looking for the curing light. Buy one for each treatment room where you do procedures that need the curing light. I see dental assistants and hygienists running down halls looking for THE light.
- Looking for the digital sensors. Again, I see team members running around looking for THE sensors. Each hygienist should have his or her own set. Maybe the assistants can share. Having each hygienist with his or her own set of sensors.

# Handle emergencies efficiently.

Many practices become totally derailed by emergencies. First, each practice must determine its own philosophy about emergency patient care. Some practices have a community commitment to see all emergency patients. If so, there is a need to reserve time each day for emergency patient care. Other practices have a commitment to comprehensive care for patients and do not see nonpatients of record for emergencies. The philosophy is up to the dentist, and it should be discussed before adopting procedures from one of the following two models:

# Model 1

Set aside a fixed time each day for emergencies. This time may vary from day to day or be at the same time every day. One of the most common complaints patients have about dentists is that they often are “too busy” to see them when they have an emergency. By having a special time reserved for this purpose, you are taking quality care of your patients.

One option would be to designate a half hour in the morning and a half hour in the afternoon for emergencies. Programming this time before or after lunch gives the doctor a longer lunch break and provides the staff with an opportunity to catch up, if no emergencies occur.

# Model 2

Review the schedule every day to determine the best time to schedule emergency patients. The front office staff then can say to the patient, “Mr. Patient, the doctor met with me this morning and told me to schedule any patients with a special need like yours at ____.”

Next, determine who does what for the emergency patient. Often, the dentist becomes involved in a lengthy conversation with the emergency patient. In all states, communication can be delegated to an auxiliary. Dentists can train their dental assistants to educate patients about treatment choices.

The dental assistant sees the emergency patient and prepares the patient for the dentist’s diagnosis. The dentist reviews the radiograph and the patient’s mouth to diagnose the emergency. He or she then leaves the patient with the assistant to explain the options available and to make any financial arrangements. If the patient stays for treatment, it should be worked into an opening in the schedule, not take time away from regularly scheduled patients. If the patient is reappointed, the dental assistant should use a bonding cement to cover the sharp part of the broken tooth, give the patient a prescription written by the dentist, or place a temporary filling.

# Patient Instructions After Scaling and Root Planing and Laser Treatment

These are some helpful suggestions that will increase your comfort and help you to receive the maximum benefit from periodontal treatment.

1. Tenderness is normal. To reduce tenderness and promote healing, 1-3 times daily for 2-3 days after treatment, rinse with warm salt water: 1⁄2 teaspoon salt in a 4 ounce glass of water. Avoid mouth rinses with alcohol in them for the first 1-2 days after the procedure, it can cause gum irritation.
2. Be gentle when brushing and flossing. It is very important that you continue to brush well directly following procedure. Please use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Do NOT floss or waterpik for 24 hours to allow for proper healing. Continue optimal homecare with brushing, flossing and waterpiking after 24 hours.
3. Tylenol or Ibuprofen may be used as recommended for discomfort.
4. For 24 hours please avoid foods with small seeds, nuts or popcorn so nothing gets stuck in the pockets during healing. Spicy foods or very acidic juices would be best to avoid as well because they can cause irritation.
5. Tooth sensitivity is normal. You may use a desensitizing toothpaste. The recommended products are Periodontax or Senodyne Gum and Sensitivity. These toothpastes are most effective when you use them morning and night every day.

Lastly, please contact our office if you have any questions, should you experience extreme prolonged bleeding or any other problems during the healing process. 720-845-5252.

# POST-SEDATION INSTRUCTIONS
---
# Post Sedation Instructions

1. Do not drive a motor vehicle for 24 hours after sedation.
2. Do not operate any hazardous devices/machinery for 24 hours after sedation.
3. A responsible adult person should be present until you have fully recovered from the effects of the sedation.
4. You should not go up and down stairs unattended. Whenever possible, stay on the first floor until recovered.
5. You should resume normal eating and drinking after the sedation appointment, unless otherwise instructed by the dentist.
6. Drink plenty of water post-operatively to prevent dehydration and to prevent the “hangover” of sedation medications.
7. After leaving the dental office, you should not be left unattended. You might feel normal and recovered, but the effects of the medication can last for several hours after the appointment has ended. Do not make important decisions for the remainder of the day following your sedation appointment.
8. Always hold someone’s arm when walking as you may have problems with balance while under the effects of the sedative medications.
9. Call the office if you have any questions or concerns. If you feel that your symptoms warrant a physician and you are unable to reach us, go to the nearest emergency room immediately.

Following most surgical procedures there may or may not be pain. You will be provided with medication for discomfort that is appropriate for you. In most cases, a non-narcotic pain regimen is recommended consisting of acetaminophen (Tylenol ®) and ibuprofen (Advil ®). These two medications taken together can be as effective as a narcotic without any of the side effects. If a narcotic has been prescribed, follow the directions carefully. If you have any questions about these medications interacting with other medications you are presently taking, please call our office (555-555-5555).

# Extraction Post Operative Instructions

- Proper care of the mouth following most dental procedures can reduce complications and speed the healing of the surgical area.
- Protection of the blood clot... Maintain gentle pressure by biting on the gauze sponge that has been placed over the surgical area. Keep steady firm pressure for 45 minutes. Repeat as often as needed. Be sure to moisten the gauze with a little water so that it won't stick to the clot.
- Do not rinse... or use a mouthwash for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, rinse with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon table salt in 8 oz. of warm water) every 1-2 hours is recommended. The use of commercial mouthwashes during the healing period is NOT advised due to the alcohol content.
- Discomfort... Following dental surgery it is normal to experience some discomfort. If medication has been given or prescribed, take as instructed.
- The toothbrush... may be carefully used in the area of the mouth not involved by the surgical procedures. A clean mouth heals faster.

# Post-Surgery Instructions

# Eating

Adequate food and fluid intake following surgery is most important. If you find that eating your regular diet is too difficult, you may supplement your diet with liquids such as Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB / any flavor). The high quality, nutritional value of CIB is important for prompt healing following such procedures. Should you not be able to chew solid foods of any nature, for several days or longer, contact our office.

# Avoid

All excessive activity. Don't pick at the surgical area. Don't consume liquids through a straw. Avoid alcoholic beverages and refrain from smoking until healing is well established.

# Sutures

If they were used, do not fail to return for their removal on the appointment date given.

# Control Swelling

Gently apply ice packs to the area for periods of 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off. This procedure should continue for the first 24 hours only.

# Medications

Make sure you take your prescribed medications strictly following instructions. Women taking birth control medications should be aware that antibiotics can cause the birth control medications to be ineffective possibly resulting in pregnancy. Alternate methods should be used while on the antibiotics.

# Pain Management

FOLLOWING MOST SURGICAL PROCEDURES THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE PAIN. YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH MEDICATION FOR DISCOMFORT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. IN MOST CASES, A NON-NARCOTIC PAIN REGIMEN IS RECOMMENDED CONSISTING OF ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL®) AND IBUPROFEN (ADVIL®). THESE TWO MEDICATIONS TAKEN TOGETHER, CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS A NARCOTIC WITHOUT ANY OF THE SIDE AFFECTS. IF A NARCOTIC HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE MEDICATIONS INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS YOU ARE PRESENTLY TAKING, PLEASE CALL OUR OFFICE, YOUR PHYSICIAN AND/OR YOUR PHARMACIST.

● IF a bone graft was placed...do not be alarmed if small pieces of the bone graft material become dislodged, be careful not to disrupt the bone graft or soft tissue membrane covering the extraction site. Make sure to attend your post operative visit for the doctor to evaluate the grafted site.

● Allergic reactions... for generalized rash, itching, or other reactions, call our office immediately. If we are not available at the time, go to the nearest hospital emergency room.

● Do not hesitate... to call if any questions arise.

# Trial Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Eat carefully with your Trial Smile or temporary veneers; they are not as strong as the permanents (this is designed intentionally to be able to remove them for the permanents).
2. Discomfort is normal for a day or two. These discomforts include tenderness under your lip at the site of injection and around the gum line where excess cement was removed. Some mild, hot and cold sensitivity is a rare but temporary side effect. For discomfort, take three ibuprofen four times a day for three days.
3. Your Trial Smile is one piece, so you will not be able to floss. Don't worry, your New Smile will be individual like your natural teeth. In the meantime, brush 2 times a day with a focus on gently brushing at the gum line.
4. Your homework is to notice things that need improvement on the trial smile such as imperfections with the bite, length, color, and other aesthetic desires. Your next appointment is 1-3 days after the trial smile. Please take the time to get used to your different smile and note what you like and don't like. At this easy, 40-minute appointment (no numbing), Your Smile Design team will make adjustments to the trial smile until it's exactly to your liking. Only when that happens, will we take photos and impressions for our in-house ceramist to use as the blueprint for the permanent restorations. This is how we can guarantee you'll love the permanent restorations. Plastic surgeons wish they had an opportunity to try on a nose before the final. We have such an opportunity and take it very seriously.

# Final Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Now that your permanent veneers are bonded to your teeth, you can use them just as you would natural teeth. Which means eat anything you'd like but don't ever use veneers or natural teeth as tools (i.e., nail biting, tearing packages or string, etc.).
2. Floss at least daily and brush twice per day. Your gums might be tender for 24-48 hours but please continue brushing and flossing through the minor discomfort. It will help the gums heal faster. If small bits of material come out, don't be alarmed. This is excess cement that loosens.

# Veneer Maintenance

1. If by any chance, anything ever happens to one of your veneers, contact us immediately. We're proud of our 99.3% (national average of 90%) success rate with veneers, but on the very rare occasion one can break or debond.
2. A custom night guard is recommended to protect your new smile from nighttime teeth grinding that most people do without even knowing it.
3. Maintain a normal schedule of cleanings as directed to keep up your gums healthy and increase the health and longevity of all of your teeth.
4. Smile as much as possible, it makes the world a better place!

# Post Op Denture Care

1. It’s important that your dentures, like natural teeth, be kept free from plaque and tartar. This prevents permanent staining and bad breath. Use a denture brush and one of the many commercial cleaning products to thoroughly clean all of the surfaces of the denture at least once a day.
2. Rinse your dentures after eating.
3. Using a soft bristled brush, brush your remaining teeth, as well as your tongue, palate and gums. This not only removes plaque and keeps your breath fresh, it also massages your gums and stimulates circulation, keeping your natural teeth and tissues healthy.
4. Tough stains and tartar can be removed by soaking your dentures in white vinegar for several hours. After you’ve cleaned your dentures, always remember to rinse them in water before placing them back in your mouth.
5. If your dentures have no metal parts, you can soak them in a diluted bleach solution to remove tough stains. Never soak your dentures in a cleaning solution for more than 15 minutes if they have any metal parts. Be sure to rinse them thoroughly before placing them in your mouth.
6. Whenever they are out of your mouth, your dentures should be stored in water.
7. Your gums need to rest each day, so don’t wear your dentures to bed at night.
8. See us regularly for examinations to ensure your dentures fit properly and your mouth stays healthy.
9. Always let us know right away — call us at 720-845-5252 — if you notice any changes in your bite or fit.

# Post Operative Instructions Following Root Canal Therapy

Congratulations on surviving the dreaded root canal. You’ll be happy to know that, according to the current literature, the five year success rate for root canals is over 90%.
---
Uncommon for there to be some minor to moderate discomfort in the area after the root canal. It is normal for the tooth to be uncomfortable for 10 days after today’s treatment. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, the tooth and surrounding tissues may remain sore for a few weeks post treatment. This can be due to a number of factors which include soreness from the injection, soreness from placement of the rubber dam clip and from inflammation around the tip of the root. Inflammation is a normal part of the healing process as your body rids the area around the tip of the tooth of the remains of the infected pulp tissue. Your tooth may be sensitive to biting pressure or the tooth may even feel loose. It’s all the result of the inflammation and sensitivity of the nerve ending in the tissue just outside the end of the root where we cleaned, irrigated and placed filler and sealer material.

DO NOT eat or drink anything for the next half hour.

DO NOT “check out” the area with your tongue or finger. You have a temporary filling in the tooth and it takes about half an hour to harden. You are also numb and may damage your tissues.

DO NOT use the tooth to bite down on anything hard (peanuts, pretzels, ice, etc.) until the permanent crown has been placed on the tooth. The tooth is prone to fracture and if you bite down on anything too hard or crunchy you may crack and ultimately lose the tooth. You will need to have the permanent crown or filling placed as soon as possible.

# WHAT DO I DO IF THERE’S DISCOMFORT?

The primary line of defense against discomfort is over the counter medication. We recommend that you take 600 mg ibuprofen (three over the counter pills of Advil, Motrin or generic equivalent) every 6 hours for the next two days, OR if you are unable to take ibuprofen, 1000mg acetaminophen (two extra strength Tylenol or generic equivalent) every six to eight hours for the next two days. Most of the time this is enough to handle any discomfort. You may also be given a prescription for an antibiotic and/or a prescription for a pain reliever. Fill the prescription for the antibiotic and begin taking the medication. Fill the prescription for the pain reliever only if you need it. It is our goal to ensure that you are comfortable.

# CARE AFTER IMPLANT SURGERY

Congratulations! You are the owner of a new dental implant. Implant surgery is 90% successful and in order to increase the chances of implant success, it is important that you carefully follow these post surgery instructions.

1. Day of surgery: Do not disturb area, avoid rinsing and spitting that day. A certain amount of bleeding is expected following surgery. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure to the surgical area for 90 minutes, then you may eat or drink. If bleeding persists, a moist tea bag should be held firmly in the area of bleeding for 90 minutes.
2. Ice the surgical area (side of face) for first 4 hours; apply ice 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off.
---
# 3. For pain relief:

For the first 24 hours only, take two 200mg tabs of ibuprofen with two extra strength tylenol every 6 hours; after that, take 600mg ibuprofen every 6 hours (it may be helpful to eat 30 minutes prior to taking pain medication to prevent nausea).

# 4. Antibiotics:

Take as prescribed until they are gone.

# 5. Drink plenty of fluids

(do not use a straw).

# 6. Diet:

A proper diet is essential to healing. Soft foods are recommended. Stay away from sharp brittle foods (no popcorn, potato chips, etc.). Try to chew on the non-operated side of your mouth. Avoid citrus fruits, fruit juices, highly spiced foods and alcohol; these will cause pain.

# 7. Do not smoke

for AT LEAST the first 5 days following surgery.

# 8. Rinsing:

Starting the day after surgery, rinse with warm salt water every 2-3 hours. Begin the prescription anti-bacterial mouth rinse 5 days after surgery or after the wound is healed. Rinse 2-3 times per day for 60 seconds with the prescription mouth rinse, continue to also mix in rinsing with warm salt water. Avoid all other mouth rinses until doctor has informed you that the surgical site is fully healed.

# 9. Avoiding toothpaste

for 72 hours following surgery will help healing. Simply brush with warm water and DO NOT disturb the surgical site. Also remember to brush your tongue to keep bacteria growth down.

# 10. DO NOT chew

on any exposed portion of implant.

# 11. Bruising and swelling

may occur. Swelling is usually proportional to the surgery involved and swelling is at its peak in the first 48-72 hours. To control swelling: Ice on and off for first 48 hours and apply warm compresses (warm wash rag) after that. If swelling appears abnormal inform our office immediately.

# 12. If your jaw is sore,

chewing sugar-free gum may help loosen the muscles.

# Post-op calls Protocol

(Responsibility of the Dentist and Dental Assistants/Hygienists)

1. Post Op calls are to be made every day for all patients that got numb on prior clinical day.
2. Celi will do her Tuesday Post Op calls on Thursday, Jordyn will do her Wednesday Post Op calls on Friday, Cody will do his Friday Post Op Calls on Tuesday, Celi will make Michelle’s Post Op calls from Wednesday on Thursday... If any team member is concerned they don’t have time to complete them, they will notify other team member who they need help calling. All calls must be done by end of day.
3. First Priority call Sedations, Extractions, Implants, Endo, Quadrant fillings.
---
# 4. Second Priority

anyone else that got numb i.e. single crown, 1-3 fillings etc.

# 5. Document the date, time & any pertinent information from the post op call in the CommLog in Open Dental, if text copy & paste text in commlog

# 6. By end of day every patient has been Post Op called or Texted Via Yapi (see below for sample PO call & text verbiage)

# Restorative Patients

- All restorative appointments involving any anesthetic, prosthetic delivery, or any general concern deserve a post-op call from the DDS assistant
- Example Call: “Hi John, this is ________From Green Dental Care! ☺ I am calling to make sure you are doing ok after your appointment yesterday and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye! ☺”
- Example Text “Hi John, this is ________From Green Dental Care! ☺ I am reaching out to make sure you are doing ok after your appointment yesterday, please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything, have a great day!” (copy & paste the text in commlog)

NOTE: All post-op calls should be performed as soon as reasonably possible after the time of service. The next day is ideal, but not always possible.

# 1. Hygiene Patients

- All hygiene appointments deserve a post-op call the following day regarding their hygiene experience
- Example: “Hi John, this is ___Celi_____ from Green Dental Care! ☺ I am calling to make sure you had a pleasant experience yesterday with your cleaning and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye! ☺”

Fillings: If bite is high see if they can come in for an adjustment. Discomfort to hot, cold, chewing is normal, it can last for a few weeks up to several months, every patient and every tooth is different.

Temp Crown: if bite is high, get them in for a bit adjustment. Remind them to be careful with anything sticky or hard on the temp and to let us know if the temp comes off.
---
# Endo & Oral Surgery

Tenderness is normal for 10 days, most discomfort is the first 72 hours after the procedure where inflammation is at its peak. (If given medications remind them to take as prescribed)

# Extraction

Tenderness is normal, most discomfort is the first 48-72 hours. Every patient is different, some heal about in 2 weeks and some can heal for about 6 months.

# Temporary Crown Post-OP Instructions

- A temporary crown is less durable and meant to be easily removed by your doctor.
- Avoid eating hard, crunchy, or sticky foods until your permanent crown is ready.
- Avoid flossing directly around the temporary, this could cause it to loosen or come off.
- Please resume normal brushing immediately but be gentle around the temporary crown.
- Your gums may be sore for a few days following the procedure. You can rinse with warm salt water to help reduce pain and swelling. You can also take Tylenol or ibuprofen as needed for the pain.
- It is normal to experience sensitivity to temperature and pressure following the procedure. This should pass after your mouth adapts to the temp crown.
- Your temp crown may be shaped differently than your original tooth. Your tongue may magnify these differences but you will become accustomed to them in a few days.
- If your temp crown comes off during non-business hours, do not be alarmed. CVS and Walgreens sell temporary crown cement. Simply re-cement it with a small amount of this cement and call our office to schedule a follow up appointment.

# Common FAQs Back to Front Office

This training was developed in order to address training assistants on most common questions from front to back office and empower them to get the solutions without burning out the front office team.

As assistants become more proficient some will have created a habit of going to Office manager or treatment coordinator still for common situations that they could solve on their own, this was part of a training we did to empower assistants to become better problem solvers.

# Chapter 5

# Leadership in the Dental Office

Whether an owner or associate dentists, if you have DMD or DDS after your name, you will be looked to from the team and patients for leadership. Your role as a leader is assumed and the team watches your every move, so it makes sense that we have some basic leadership skills.

Key rules are to never be a part of gossip. Gossip is essentially pointing out the faults of someone that is not present, to feel better about yourself and get closer to the person that you are sharing those judgments with.

# Key rules to abide by are:

1. Assume the Best because no one wants to do a bad job.
2. Assume any mistake is one of misunderstanding (in other words there has been a communication breakdown somewhere, insufficient training)

# 12 Week Leadership Training Framework

(note we only share weeks 1 and 2 as an example here, you could build out what this program looks like for you over 12 weeks, meeting every week without fail)

# Objective / Mission (redefined Mission, Vision, purpose w/ team)

1. Create a self-managing team - united team on a common mission
1. How?
1. Individual & professional growth
1. everyone levels up
2. Team Lead Roles:
1. you are the CEO of ...
3. Remove owner Dr. as a bottleneck
4. Create a culture where everyone has a reason to show up besides a paycheck

# How do we measure success to our objective?
---
# 1. Pleasant place to work

- a. Happy team
- b. Gossip Free
- c. Blame Free
- d. Support each other: regular praise & acknowledgement

# 2. Pleasant people to do business with

# How do we know if we succeed?

1. Team is Happy
2. Patient’s are happy
3. Individual Growth & Fulfillment
4. If owner Dr. left for 6 months, he would come back to a more well run office with an improved culture

Likely, you are in the position to have the hard conversation, because the small things have added up, and you have avoided it for as long as possible.

1. Ask yourself what is contributing to the weight of this being a hard conversation?
1. Is it your EGO?
2. Is it the amount of time you have let it go unchecked?
3. Have you previously demonstrated consistency on this issue with this employee or others?
2. What energy do you plan to bring to the conversation?
1. Why do you think that energy will elicit the most effective outcome?
2. Keep your goals of the conversation at the forefront.
3. Do not show up angry.
3. Three parts of a hard conversation
1. The Story that you have created in your head based on the information that you have
2. The main character of the story
3. Focus on your goal of the conversation, the outcome. And frame your wording accordingly. Don’t bring up a past encounter focus on how shifting behavior A can have a positive outcome for the employee and their teammates

# Reprimands

The longer you have ignored a problem or failed to address it, the more angry you will be when you finally address it. This framework can be applied to any unchecked employee issues. Some examples include an employee showing up late, not living up to cultural expectations, or not providing a top tier patient experience.

# Questions to Ask:

1. Do you want the employee to feel bad or do you want the behavior to change?
2. What matters more, being right or effecting change?

# Goal to Focus On:

1. What they need to know is how can the outcome be changed moving forward?
2. Don’t focus on the past.

# De-Escalating Patient Situations

I thought I’d share this because it came up in conversation with a doc that I know, and I think the best. Time to visit the things that bring us the most brain damage is when all is well that way if or when a situation does arise (luckily very rarely) we are more prepared and thus can approach the situation with hopefully less stress and more confidence.

Each situation is unique but this is a basic framework.

# Step 1

- Mindset - think “Do I need to be right or do I want to be effective”
The need to be right so the patient is wrong will almost always escalate a situation faster, so come with the mindset I want to be effective. Being effective looks like the least amount of headache, and least amount of financial and time commitment and I would prioritize time over money here. If you’re focused on keeping money in your pocket here, that’s fine, but you will often pay a greater price if you stick your heals in on that mindset.
- Sincere Second Degree Acknowledgement. To de-escalate the patient.
---
This is sometimes all it takes. (refer to link above for training)

- But let’s say we gave our best crack at second degree acknowledgement and that’s just not good enough for this person.
- Carefully document the interaction.
- The goal is to de-escalate the situation here and find an amicable solution for all parties. Allow some time for patient to cool-off. Trying to solve a problem while tempers are flared is not the best option.

# Step 2

- If we are in person with patient, we want to avoid talking in circles, which is often what these patients will drag us in to.
- Never get into a back and forth. “This hasn’t gone the way either of us expected or wanted, why don’t we curb the conversation and follow up on a call.”
- We can ask their permission that this call is recorded, usually not permissible as evidence but it will help us dictate clear notes of the situation.
- We may get on 1 call with them, but this isn’t going to be a series of calls and emails, typically you want to say less than necessary.
- Let them get into word vomit, not you.
- Depending on the situation or “threat” this may be the time to contact Malpractice carrier for advice.
- Contact Malpractice Carrier: you want to notify the malpractice carrier of a developing situation earlier rather than later. There is no cost to contact them, you simply tell them, “here is the situation that is developing, nothing has happened yet, do you have any advice at this time.”
- DO NOT allow for this to turn into an email thread if possible. If it turns this direction and the patient starts making demands via written email, this will automatically trigger malpractice requiring a lawyer to get involved and result in a case being opened up on your record.

# Step 3

- Depending on the situation, see what options you have to appease the patient to make the situation right in their mind to avoid a lawsuit:

# Step 4

- Let’s say, a patient threatens that they’ve gotten or will be getting their lawyer involved.
- Don’t be cavalier about this, but you may calmly let them know…please go ahead and give us your attorney’s number and we’ll give him a call, we’re happy to talk to him. (The tone here is not cocky, but such that, no problem we aren’t scared, neutral demeanor)
---
# Remember

- Photography, good notes, proper documentation will save your butt
- I would hope there’s no negligence on our part and the consent they signed doesn’t guarantee a result, it just guarantees they were told everything to make an informed decision for themself. We have no idea how

# Addressing Contrast Situations

|Deep Breath:|The are confused:|De-Escalate:|
|---|---|---|
|Control our energy, there is nothing to argue about|where is the miscommunication or misunderstanding|2nd Degree Acknowledgement|

# 2nd degree acknowledgement - they’re loaded for bear and want their feelings validated

1. Action: Hold on, the phone cut out for one second and I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly…
- You were expecting X
- But Y happened
- And WE’RE looking for answers as to what’s going on
2. Impact: “This is not what either of us were expecting, I want you to know we’re taking this seriously”
3. Feeling: “I know this couldn’t feel good for you because it sounds very frustrating”

# AVOID:

1. Talking in circles
2. Answering questions you don’t have the answer to
3. Having to be right

“Ok I’m going to step in right there because this is important”

“I’m looking forward to taking care of this for you”

“Let me put you on a quick hold to see what game they’re (the insurance company) playing”

Pin it back on us against insurance…

“This is what they’re doing to us, here’s what we’ve done to try and get them to do what they’re suppose to, but I see them play this game all the time and I don’t have a lot of confidence that they’re going to do what we expected”

If Patient needs to be dismissed: refer to Dismissing Red Flag Patients and have Dr. G or OM do that.

# Top 3 things patients call mad about:

1. Insurance didn’t pay something & they have a bill
2. In Network or OON
3. Treatment ?

# Dismissing & Red Flag Patients Protocol

Kindly refer these patients out…

(Luckily 95% of patients are amazing, but we need a strategy to mitigate these negative experiences with the other 5%)

Remember: “They’re just CONFUSED” - always take the high road

# Front Office:

(Referral- Have someone to refer them to that would be a “better fit”)

Screening these patients on the phone. These are usually going to be people that off the bat you can tell are going to be problematic, long winded, asking too many questions, blaming prior dentists, sometimes combative from the start.

Use your best judgment.

Tell them… “Based on what you’re telling me, I don’t want to waste your time, I want you to know our office is probably not the best fit for you, but Dr. ______ also in _____ can take great care of you, his number is 555-555-5555” (if you give them an alternative solution they’re less likely to get mad)

OR - for an existing patient that we’ve denoted as RED FLAG- DO NOT RESCHEDULE or if you thought the patient had left practice already & isn’t welcome back…

(confirm that we have Turned off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders)

# The FIRM approach

… “you know last time you were here we know there were some concerns you had and Dr. XYZ feels this practice might not be the best place for you and we’d like to help you find another dentist…”

# Softer Approach

“Dr. XYZ is booked out for 6 weeks & in these situations it’s very important you are seen right away, Dr ABC will take great care of you…”

# Hygiene:

Do not schedule their recall...put a pop up “RED FLAG -Do Not Reschedule”

Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate

# Restorative:

Do not reschedule patient after final restorative appointment is complete

put a pop up “RED FLAG - Do Not Reschedule”

Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate

# Doctor:

if a patient is constantly complaining about the service or the work then perhaps it’s time for them to look for a new dentist.

“Our working together just doesn’t make sense, it makes you upset and then it makes me upset because you’re upset, so there’s a doc that I know that I think you’re gonna like- his name is Dr. ABC and Lindsey will get you his phone number…I think he gonna be a better fit for you”

If the Doctor is in the room with a patient that drags them down the path… “Let me bring in the expert” … “I’m gonna go get Lindsey, she’s really the expert here, Lindsey here’s what going on, angry Jim Bob here has some questions about… how can we handle this Lindsey…”- the Treatment coordinator or office manager has already been debriefed on this situation and they know what tools they have in their pocket to resolve the situation whether it’s a refund or referral or discount - the expert will deliver the news/solution - in the future then Lindsey sees the patient smiling “hey Andy what’s going on?”

# Dealing with Patients that try to bypass - team to get to Dr. ABC…

# How to protect yourself from bad reviews…

# Helpful Verbiage with contrast patients

“We shouldn’t do business together. We just shouldn’t do it, it doesn't make sense.”

“We haven’t been able to satisfy your needs, this happens…”

“We’ve reached the end of our working relationship” (FIRM version) - “tell us where to send your records, if we don’t hear from you, here are some people we could recommend”

“What is it exactly that you thought you were expecting but didn’t get from our practice ?”

“what were you expecting?” It’s not “what do you need”

# Dismissing patients

# THE LETTER for Dismissing

- dismissal letter is a last resort (try not to have to write a dismissal letter while the fire is hot bc it could make it worse, maybe send it later if you need to but hope that they go elsewhere and self select out…)

# Chapter 5

# Exams & Treatment Coordinator

Clear communication is a critical skill in any business. A big focus in any dental practice is verbiage, “what we say” and “how we deliver” what we are saying. New team members (even if they’ve been in dental a while) need to learn the “language” of your dental practice. This evolution usually goes something like this:

1. Discovery - they are discovering a new language and way of communicating. This can be overwhelming so we need to simplify this for them (a good example of this is how we get dental assistants up to speed with communicating post op instructions which we share in the post op section).
2. Regurgitate - at this stage they have now heard the verbiage enough that they can repeat it to a patient, but don’t quite understand what they are saying well enough to go “off-script” and put it in their own words.
3. Mastery - Now they know what to say and understand what they’re saying, thus can put the verbiage into words that are comfortable to them.

Building rapport and having ways to describe treatment to patients are case acceptance skills that help us drive more revenue to the practice. Less important for the back office, but when answering phones the two conversations that can make or break a practice are insurance conversations and combating cancellations. Below you will find our process for building rapport, buzz words for creating urgency, what to say and not to say in the dental office, handling cancellation and insurance questions and much more.

One last relationship building “trick” that we utilize in our practice is to capture what we call FORM on every patient.

- F: Family - marital status, kids, grandkids etc
- O: Occupation - their profession, job

- Patient’s appreciate an explanation of the procedure to be done
- Patients are visual
- take a HIGH QUALITY intra-oral photo to show the patient the tooth (dry the tooth free of saliva!) take an intra-oral picture of a healthy tooth in their mouth and say this is what a healthy tooth looks like then take a picture of the problematic tooth
- Play a dental education Video
- get a model
- What is it you were looking for when you were in search of a new dentist?

- Most of our Patients choose…
- I’m not going to lie to you, you’ll be very sore, but It’s better than the discomfort you’d have to go through to replace the tooth

# Treatment Coordinator Notes

# How to Avoid Over-explaining

1. LESS IS MORE
1. When you over explain it’s because you have a fear that they won’t believe you, so you give more detail in hopes that they will believe you know what you’re talking about.
2. The more words you use to tell the truth, the less believable it sounds.
3. When you give more detail, you aren’t preventing misunderstanding, you’re ensuring it.
2. DON’T ASSUME THEIR QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT
1. If they want to know, they will ask. If they have a question, they will ask.
2. Instead of being a waterfall of information, be a well.
3. Next time you find yourself using the word “Because”, ask yourself: DID THEY ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION, OR DO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY NEED IT?
1. If it’s because you feel like it, you can probably do better without it.

# Verbiage

It’s about WHAT we say & HOW we say it

# Don’t ask questions…

- NOT “would you like to get those fillings scheduled?”
- Instead “LET’S GO AHEAD and get you on Dr. Blue’s schedule, how does next Tuesday at 3pm look?”
- Not “Do you want to take care of that…”
- Instead “Let’s go ahead and take care of that now…”
- Avoid: Yes or No Questions - it is harder to come back and take control of the conversation when you do not get the answer you want or expect
- “Do you have any questions?” vs “What questions do you have for me?”

NEVER EVER EVER talk about PPO vs. Premier on a NP call - they have no clue what you’re talking about - if you find out they’re PPO only later - you call them back & have this convo

# Other Verbiage to Avoid

- CAN’T & UNFORTUNATELY instead say FORTUNATELY, I have great news
- Avoid talking about fee schedules - people don’t know what you’re talking about
- Avoid getting wrapped up in insurance conversations, let’s not forget the value we bring to the patient
- Never say the schedule is wide open- specify a couple times (start by offering the same time and day the next week)

# Treatment Presentation Fundamentals

- Avoid Word Vomit - power in some silence
- Speak Confidently and Clearly
- Creating Urgency
- Goal is same day Tx (if time allows- they are already here, saves a trip, saves practice money, etc.)
- Avoid Overwhelming the patient (prioritizing- can present 1st priority only if they seem very overwhelmed)
- Whenever someone offers you $ take it
- Pre collect if we can - do not give option

# Collecting

“It will be nine-ninety-eight today…” (do not say dollars)

If we take care of a patient don’t be afraid to take credit for it

Ex: “As a courtesy to you Dr. Blue went ahead and took care of that 3D X-ray”
---
# Presenting Treatment

# Smaller Treatment Plan (which will be completed in 1 visit)

Present all the treatment, MUST still re-iterate Urgency

Goal: Same Day or Get patient scheduled within 1-2 weeks with Doctor

1. Here’s the recommended treatment (summarize what doc said w/ urgency)
2. Your insurance is going to take care of a good portion of this, again anytime we’re dealing with insurance this is our best estimate
3. Your portion for everything is six-hundred-ninety
4. We can go ahead and take care of that today let’s get you on the schedule - how’s next Tuesday at 1 pm

# Power in Silence

# Very Large Treatment Plan

Once treatment has been prioritized…

Avoid overwhelming the patient “Foot in the door”

“Dr. Alex’s biggest concern is this first priority, we definitely want to get that taken care of right away, we find it best to focus on getting this done & then follow up with next steps…”

Power in Silence

Helping block things together - explaining you only have to get numb once if we get half SRP and fillings together

Use oral sedation/ nitrous to help patients with dental anxiety- it is a great service

If they do say no- ask pt if we can follow up with them in a few weeks (add to audit list)

Getting over Fears of talking about $$$

Remember- you did not create this problem - you are offering a solution

This problem will never get cheaper for the patient than it is today- you advocating for them to get it done now is your greatest ability to save them $

The problem is not going away by you avoiding the $ convo

Avoid making assumptions about the patient’s financial situation and their feelings about $, what they consider “expensive” etc

Don’t offer/bring up payment plans unless the patient asks

Don’t project your own personal view on $ & finances on the patient (It’s a free country and their choice how they want to spend their $)

# Breaking up Payments - Collecting

1. GOAL- Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan
---
# 3. In office payment plan

50% down and break up into 3-4 payments - need proper paperwork

# 4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing

# 5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford

# Example verbiage when patient accepts treatment, declines NG

“Apparently these guys don’t believe in preventing future damage and costs so they’re not going to pay for your NG but FORTUNATELY you do get a discount and as Dr. X discussed this is really going to help protect your teeth long term”

“So let’s go ahead and get you scanned for the NG ….”

Or

“Let’s go ahead & get you scheduled for X tx and that NG”

# Phone Tips

- Take a deep breath & SMILE
- Avoid rabbit holes, take control of the conversation
- Don’t get caught answering all of the questions, you need to lead the conversation
- TONE: match their tone - volume & speed
- AVOID - word vomit / too much info
- Communication is 55% non-verbal so on the phone all we have is 38% our tone and 7% the words we use
- Group Phone Training Idea: pick mostly good ones and a few bad ones and sit around and critique each other - make it fun!

# Common “difficult” phone call themes

- Patient Asks right away “Do you take my insurance”
- YOUR RESPONSE “I can absolutely help you with that, who can we thank for referring you to our office?”

Patient calls to cancel &lt;48 hours notice
- YOUR RESPONSE “Ohhh, can I ask what’s going on?”

“Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# Exam Sheet to become Proficient With

The Office Manager should be familiar with our expectations from the dental assisting team regarding patient workups and hygiene team regarding co-discovery (prepping the patient for the doctor exam). The following 2 images are laminated back to back and situated on the 12 o’clock counter in every restorative op. The assistants fill this out. It has 2 purposes. Firstly, it is a checklist to make sure the assistant has completely set up their room & gathered all of the correct photos and x-rays. Additionally, it tells us why the patient is here. One side is for an existing patient that is here for scheduled treatment and the other side is for a new or existing patient emergency.

# Denture Instructions to Verbalize with Patient

1. It is a major transition to go from teeth to dentures
2. Dentures are uncomfortable, you will get sore spots
3. Dentures provide 10% of the bite force that your natural teeth did

202
---
# 4.

There will be a significant learning curve to getting used to dentures so DON’T GIVE UP

# 5.

They will get loose over time and need to be relined

# 6.

You will need adjustments

# 7.

TIPS: start with soft foods and work your way up, read out loud, don’t just put them in a drawer

# 8.

Dentures Stink - but implants can help

# Hygiene and Doctor Co-Discovery/Edification Tips

Edification - The instruction or improvement of a person morally or intellectually. To uplift or speak highly of someone.

# Hygiene:

- Completely fill out laminated Exam sheet
- For existing patients look at previous exam sheets for watches or outstanding treatment
- Take Intraoral photos on EVERYONE even if not due for X-Rays or teeth are “Perfect”
- Educate, talk about some sort of treatment
- What you can talk about… SRP, Laser, Fluoride, Fillings (Class 1 or Class 2), Failing Amalgams, Crowns, Night Guards, Missing teeth (Bridges or implants), Whitening, Invisalign and Cosmetic Dentistry
- Edify the Doctors for success - CREATE URGENCY
- Verbiage “I’m concerned about.. I want to have the Doctor take a look at this.. ETC”

# Doctors:

We are responsible for the results we create which means, we are responsible for the opportunities that we create for ourselves.

# Be Prepared, Be Proactive and Be Consistent

# Before Huddle -

- Split up Doctor Exams
- Review patients previous X-Rays, Exam Sheets and outstanding treatment
- Bring an Impact Item on an existing patient to huddle
- Take good IO’s - Seeing is Believing
- Verbiage “Dr. G/I was previously watching or previously recommended” “I agree with the hygienist…” If you disagree with the hygienist still acknowledge what they recommended, say “I think it can wait”
- Flow of the Exam - Ask the Hygienist questions in front of the patient, for example: “So Michelle how’s everything looking?.. Michelle, is there anything you want me to be aware of that caught your eye?” Hygienist speaks, then thank the hygienist for the nice summary.
---
this you can open up the conversation with the patient by asking “What kind of questions do you have for me?”

- Do your EOD sheets and KPI’s (Set goals for yourself)
- Strive for same day treatment but always make sure to check with the DA’s before promising anything to the patient (do this before you start your exam if you think it might be an opportunity for a same day start)
- Edify your treatment coordinator, say things like “This is Megan, she’s going to help us make sense of everything we talk about today from a financial perspective.. ETC” This will build trust between your patient and TC which in return will build better trust with your patient and you
- Capitalize on Recall patients too.. Patients with seemingly “perfect teeth” you can always recommend Night Guard, Invisalign, small Class 1 fillings and bring up watches if you see them

# Audits -

Front office to do the audits for 3 and 9 weeks follow ups, regardless of this you will want to track and follow up with certain patients on your own like any big cases you have treatment planned. Doing this will allow you to own parts of your schedule and build further trust with your patients, making them more eager to get treatment done.

# Say this not that verbiage

- Hang out NOT wait
- Insurance friendly/directly contracted/ participate with NOT out of network
- Courtesy NOT discount
- Patient Portion / Responsibility NOT Balance
- NEVER EVER SAY OUR POLICY
- Discomfort NOT pain
- Conservative NOT just/small (“just a small filling”)
- Numb NOT shot
- Most of our patients take advantage of the benefits of fluoride NOT do you usually get fluoride
- Complimentary NOT free
- Appointment change NOT cancellation
- Luckily/thankfully NOT unfortunately
- Verify insurance NOT run insurance
- Let’s go ahead and get you scheduled NOT do you want to get scheduled
- Pre-Collecting - Let’s go ahead and take care of that NOT do you want to…
- Fifty one - o - eight NOT five thousand one hundred and eight
- Directly Contracted NOT Out-of-Network
---
# Benefits NOT insurance

NEVER EVER EVER TALK ABOUT DELTA PPO vs. PREMIER on a NP call- you can call them back and tell them if you found out it was PPO only.

On a NP call, when they ask “Do you take my insurance” before even saying hello….your response: “Let me be the first to welcome you to our office”

# PRE-SEDATION INSTRUCTIONS

Things to do/remember the day before your appointment:
---
- No smoking* - This affects the level of sedation during your treatment, and can negatively affect your comfort level during the appointment.
- No alcohol* - The dentist cannot safely sedate you if you have had alcohol, narcotics pain medicines (including Vicodin/Hydrocodone) or any street or recreational drugs.
- No caffeine
- Take no additional medications (e.g. OTC pain medications and antacids, herbal or nutritional supplements) unless discussing these medications with the dentist*
- Nothing to eat after midnight (or 8 hours before procedure), it is Ok to take your medication with some water on the morning of the appointment* - Unless otherwise instructed by the dentist - if your appointment is in the afternoon and you eat the day of please eat a light meal (Note: diabetics eat and take meds as normal)
- No chance of pregnancy
- If prescribed sedation medication for the night before by your dentist take as directed

# The morning of your appointment:

- Please leave jewelry and watches at home
- No contact lenses

- Wear comfortable shoes/socks
- You will be scheduled to arrive 1 hour prior to starting treatment for the administration of the sedation medication

It is absolutely essential that you have your escort drive you to your appointment. We will not be able to proceed with your appointment if you drive yourself, and this will result in forfeiting your pre-paid fee for the appointment. The person driving the patient must be able to stay with the patient until sedation wears off. (possibly 2-4 hours after arriving home)

*Regrettably, failure to comply with the items marked with an asterisk can compromise the safety of the sedation procedure. In most cases, the dentist will not be able to proceed with your treatment.

# Escort Information

Today you will supervise the recovery of a sedated patient. The effects of sedation can alter judgment, memory, walking and/or balance for up to several hours after the appointment - Sometimes More.

Please be prepared to directly protect the patient from falling or incurring other types of injury. It is easy to become distracted after a period of time, and the patient may attempt getting up to walk without assistance, which could result in the patient falling and incurring an injury.

The patient should not drive any type of vehicle or operate machinery until the next day and only if they feel fully recovered.

Please be sure the patient takes the prescribed medications as directed. It is easy for a sedated patient to get confused and not take their medications as directed (I.E. taking too many medications, the wrong medications, taking at wrong intervals, etc.). In addition, before a patient takes any medication after their appointment, the patient should have eaten something beforehand.

If you have any concerns or questions please immediately call our office at (555)555-5555 and 911 if urgent.

Thank you for your concern and commitment to the safety of our patient.

I _____________________________ have received and understand the written post sedation and post operative instructions provided to me.

# IV SEDATION PROCESS AND INFORMATION

Mountain View Anesthesia Associates

# Main Contact Person:

Fees: Minimum Time of 90 Minutes = $550

+$75 for each additional 15 Minutes

We do not offer any insurance billing and the patient pays Mountain View Directly (they can take payment and email invoice to patient from their cell phone)

In Open Dental use the no charge code Sedation Consult (SedCons) and manually add the estimated amount and add to the treatment plan. Always advise the patient that this is just an estimate for the IV sedation amount. The final payment will be calculated by the Anesthesiologist at the end of the sedation appointment.

# Post Op Instructions

A key to a fantastic patient experience is to have a full understanding of the procedures and the after-effects of those procedures. As the patient ends their treatment, it is a good idea to have a clear understanding of the rest of the process- including post-operative directions and things to expect. These are our written post op instructions. As a dental assistant, it is extremely important and necessary to memorize a version of these. In addition to telling these patients all these instructions, you may also choose to call any patient that receives anesthetic the following day. This is a great touch, a practice builder and allows you to head off post-operative questions.

# Sedation Post Op Instructions (minimal Oral Conscious Sedation)

# POST-SEDATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Do not drive a motor vehicle for 24 hours after sedation.
2. Do not operate any hazardous devices/machinery for 24 hours after sedation.
3. A responsible adult person should be present until you have fully recovered from the effects of the sedation.
4. You should not go up and down stairs unattended. Whenever possible, stay on the first floor until recovered.
5. You should resume normal eating and drinking after the sedation appointment, unless otherwise instructed by the dentist.
6. Drink plenty of water post-operatively to prevent dehydration and to prevent the “hangover” of sedation medications.
7. After leaving the dental office, you should not be left unattended. You might feel normal and recovered, but the effects of the medication can last for several hours after the appointment has.

# Post Operative Instructions

Do not make important decisions for the remainder of the day following your sedation appointment.

1. Always hold someone’s arm when walking as you may have problems with balance while under the effects of the sedative medications.
2. Call the office if you have any questions or concerns. If you feel that your symptoms warrant a physician and you are unable to reach us, go to the nearest emergency room immediately.

Following most surgical procedures there may or may not be pain. You will be provided with medication for discomfort that is appropriate for you. In most cases, a non-narcotic pain regimen is recommended consisting of acetaminophen (Tylenol ® ) and ibuprofen (Advil ® ). These two medications taken together can be as effective as a narcotic without any of the side effects. If a narcotic has been prescribed, follow the directions carefully. If you have any questions about these medications interacting with other medications you are presently taking, please call our office (555-555-5555), your physician and/or your pharmacist.

# Extraction Post Operative Instructions

Proper care of the mouth following most dental procedures can reduce complications and speed the healing of the surgical area.

- Protection of the blood clot: Maintain gentle pressure by biting on the gauze sponge that has been placed over the surgical area. Keep steady firm pressure for 45 minutes. Repeat as often as needed. Be sure to moisten the gauze with a little water so that it won't stick to the clot.
- Do not rinse: or use a mouthwash for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, rinse with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon table salt in 8 oz. of warm water) every 1-2 hours is recommended. The use of commercial mouthwashes during the healing period is NOT advised due to the alcohol content.
- Discomfort: Following dental surgery it is normal to experience some discomfort. If medication has been given or prescribed, take as instructed.
- The toothbrush: may be carefully used in the area of the mouth not involved by the surgical procedures. A clean mouth heals faster.
- Eating: Adequate food and fluid intake following surgery is most important. If you find that eating your regular diet is too difficult, you may supplement your diet with liquids such as Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB / any flavor). The high quality, nutritional value of CIB is important for prompt healing following such procedures. Should you not be able to chew solid foods of any nature, for several days or longer, contact our office.
- Avoid: all excessive activity. Don't pick at the surgical area. Don't consume liquids through a straw. Avoid alcoholic beverages and refrain from smoking until healing is well established.
- Sutures: If they were used, do not fail to return for their removal on the appointment date given.
- Control swelling: Gently apply ice packs to the area for periods of 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off. This procedure should continue for the first 24 hours only.

# Medications

Make sure you take your prescribed medications strictly following instructions. Women taking birth control medications should be aware that antibiotics can cause the birth control medications to be ineffective possibly resulting in pregnancy. Alternate methods should be used while on the antibiotics.

# Post Operative Instructions

FOLLOWING MOST SURGICAL PROCEDURES THERE MAY OR MAY NOT BE PAIN. YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH MEDICATION FOR DISCOMFORT THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. IN MOST CASES, A NON-NARCOTIC PAIN REGIMEN IS RECOMMENDED CONSISTING OF ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL®) AND IBUPROFEN (ADVIL®). THESE TWO MEDICATIONS TAKEN TOGETHER, CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS A NARCOTIC WITHOUT ANY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS. IF A NARCOTIC HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE MEDICATIONS INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS YOU ARE PRESENTLY TAKING, PLEASE CALL OUR OFFICE, YOUR PHYSICIAN AND/OR YOUR PHARMACIST.

- IF a bone graft was placed...do not be alarmed if small pieces of the bone graft material become dislodged, be careful not to disrupt the bone graft or soft tissue membrane covering the extraction site. Make sure to attend your post operative visit for the doctor to evaluate the grafted site.
- Allergic reactions... for generalized rash, itching, or other reactions, call our office immediately. If we are not available at the time, go to the nearest hospital emergency room.
- Do not hesitate... to call if any questions arise.

# ADDITIONAL POST OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF IMPACTED WISDOM TEETH

1. Following the removal of sutures, your usual oral hygiene routine may be resumed. However, the areas immediately adjacent to the 3rd molar (wisdom tooth) socket may be tender and therefore, should be brushed carefully. Gentle brushing will not injure the healing tissue.
2. Special care must be given to the healing areas of the lower impacted wisdom teeth. The use of a plastic syringe, as demonstrated by the nurse, is suggested as an aid to keeping this area clean. A Water Pik, with minimal pressure, may be used in place of the syringe. A diluted solution of any popular brand mouthwash may be used or warm salt water (1 teaspoon salt to an 8 ounce glass of warm water) may be used as a substitute. This routine, in conjunction with regular brushing of the teeth, should be performed each time immediately after food consumption.
3. The use of the syringe for the lower sockets must be maintained for at least 3 weeks. Improper oral hygiene in this area may result in complications and a postoperative infection, which can occur many weeks following the initial surgical procedure.
4. In the event of any complication, especially pain or swelling, or if there is any question regarding your postoperative progress, please telephone this office immediately.

Thank you for your cooperation.

# Post Op Instructions in Case of Sinus Communication

# MAXILLARY SINUS INSTRUCTIONS

You are given this information sheet because your surgery today involved entry into the sinus under your cheekbone. This was due to either:

- The roots of your upper back teeth extended into the sinus, and a temporary communication from the sinus into the mouth was created following the extraction in this region, or
- The surgical procedure performed today involved treating a problem within your sinus(es).

When you eat or drink following surgery near the sinus, liquid may pass into the sinus and may be discharged from the nose. This discharge may appear bloody. Do not become alarmed, this is normal. TO SPEED HEALING AND PREVENT COMPLICATIONS, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS LISTED BELOW:

1. Do not create suction by smoking, sucking on straws, etc.
2. Try to suppress sneezing. To prevent pressure buildup if sneezing occurs, keep the mouth open.
3. Do not forcefully blow your nose to “clear” the sinus or nasal passages.
4. Return for suture removal and post-operative appointments as advised by the doctor.
5. You should purchase and use the following medications.
6. Avoid Swimming and any strenuous activity for a week.
7. Do not play any wind instruments for a week.

SUDAFED 30 mg tablets: Take 2 tablets every 6 hours for _____ days.

AFRIN or NEO-SYNEPHRINE nasal spray: Use as per package instructions for no more than three (3) days.

Antibiotics: __________________________. Take as directed on prescription.

Take all above and prescribed medications as directed.

Finally, if you are concerned or do not understand the instructions, do not hesitate to call the office at any time.

# NIGHT GUARD INSTRUCTIONS (Take Home Instructions)

# Teeth Whitening

- Follow instructions included in your kit.
- Total treatment time is usually 10-14 days. Some cases may take longer, especially if treatment is interrupted.
- Make sure you brush and floss thoroughly prior to each treatment. The bleaching gel can work better if it is in contact with the tooth rather than plaque buildup.
- Mild sensitivity to cold liquids or air may occur. This usually passes a few days after treatment is completed. If the sensitivity is severe or persists, discontinue using the gel and contact our office.
- If you experience any gum irritation, let us know. Your custom tray may need to be adjusted.
- Whitening works best on yellow stained teeth. Gray teeth are more difficult to whiten, or may not respond to treatment. Such cases may require porcelain veneers to achieve the desired result.
- Results can be quite dramatic. However upon completion of the whitening process, the color will “tone down” somewhat. This is normal and actually looks more natural.
- Long term results vary from patient to patient. This can depend on many factors including habits such as smoking or coffee, tea, wine, or cola consumption.
- “Touch-up” treatments may be needed every 3 – 6 months. This can usually be accomplished in 1 or 2 treatments of 1 – 2 hours each. A special touch-up kit is available at our office.
- Existing fillings, crowns, bonding, etc. will not whiten. Therefore, these restorations may need to be changed in order to match your new smile.
- It is important to keep your 2-week follow-up appointment so we can assess the results or make changes in treatment as needed.
- If you have unsightly old silver fillings ask us about changing them to invisible white fillings. Old crowns with dark gum lines can be changed to more natural looking metal-free porcelain crowns.
- If your friends wonder why you are smiling so much, tell them about us. It would be our pleasure to help them improve their smiles, too!

# PREVIDENT 5000 FLUORIDE GEL

If you are receiving these instructions that means you have been prescribed a topical fluoride toothpaste to aid in keeping your teeth healthy. In certain cases you may be receiving custom trays to aid in the application of the gel directly to the teeth.

# Indications:

Dry mouth, root surface caries, high caries risk children and adults.

# Instructions:

Before bed, following normal brushing, flossing and rinsing, apply a pea size amount of Prevident gel to toothbrush and brush onto all surfaces of all teeth, then spit out, do not rinse!

# PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SCALING AND ROOT PLANING

These are some helpful suggestions that will increase your comfort and help you to receive the maximum benefit from periodontal treatment.
---
# Tenderness is normal.

To reduce tenderness and promote healing, every two to three hours, rinse with warm salt water: ½ teaspoon salt in a 4 ounce glass of water.

# Post-Operative Instructions

1. Avoid brushing or flossing the treated area for 12 hours. However, after 12 hours it is very important that you continue to brush well. Please be careful brushing and use a toothbrush with soft bristles. You may moisten the brush with warm water if tissues are tender.
2. Tylenol or Ibuprofen may be used as recommended for discomfort.
3. Highly nutritious food is necessary for the healing process. Avoid foods that require excessive chewing, also, sticky, crunchy or coarse foods.
4. Tooth sensitivity is normal and temporary. You may use a desensitizing toothpaste such as Sensodyne or any major brand for sensitivity relief.
5. You may also gently massage the areas treated with your washed fingers. This will increase circulation and promote healing.

Lastly, please contact our office (555-555-5555) should you experience prolonged bleeding or any other problems during the healing process. These suggestions will help you receive the greatest benefit from today’s treatment.

# Trial Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Eat carefully with your Trial Smile or temporary veneers; they are not as strong as the permanents (this is designed intentionally to be able to remove them for the permanents).
2. Discomfort is normal for a day or two. These discomforts include tenderness under your lip at the site of injection and around the gum line where excess cement was removed. Some mild, hot and cold sensitivity is a rare but temporary side effect. For discomfort, take three ibuprofen four times a day for three days.
3. Your Trial Smile is one piece, so you will not be able to floss. Don't worry, your New Smile will be individual like your natural teeth. In the meantime, brush 2 times a day with a focus on gently brushing at the gum line.
4. Your homework is to notice things that need improvement on the trial smile such as imperfections with the bite, length, color, and other aesthetic desires. Your next appointment is 1-3 days after the trial smile. Please take the time to get used to your different smile and note what you like and don't like. At this easy, 40-minute appointment (no numbing), Your Smile Design team will make adjustments to the trial smile until it's exactly to your liking. Only when that happens, will we take photos and impressions for our in-house ceramist to use as the blueprint for the permanent restorations. This is how we can guarantee you'll love the permanent restorations. Plastic surgeons wish they had an opportunity to try on a nose before the final. We have such an opportunity and take it very seriously.

# Final Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Now that your permanent veneers are bonded to your teeth, you can use them just as you would natural teeth. Which means eat anything you'd like but don't ever use veneers or natural teeth as tools (i.e., nail biting, tearing packages or string, etc.).
---
# 2. Floss at least daily and brush twice per day.

Your gums might be tender for 24-48 hours but please continue brushing and flossing through the minor discomfort. It will help the gums heal faster. If small bits of material come out, don't be alarmed. This is excess cement that loosens over the next few days and is completely normal. For discomfort, take three ibuprofen four times a day for three days.

# 3. Your Perfect Bite appointment will be in a few days.

Much like the previous appointment, it's a quick, no-numbing appointment to fine-tune the bite, clean up cement left over, and very minor adjustments to the aesthetics.

# Veneer Maintenance

1. If by any chance, anything ever happens to one of your veneers, contact us immediately. We're proud of our 99.3% (national average of 90%) success rate with veneers, but on the very rare occasion one can break or debond.
2. A custom night guard is recommended to protect your new smile from nighttime teeth grinding that most people do without even knowing it.
3. Maintain a normal schedule of cleanings as directed to keep up your gums healthy and increase the health and longevity of all of your teeth.
4. Smile as much as possible, it makes the world a better place!

# Post Operative Instructions Following Root Canal Therapy

Congratulations on surviving the dreaded root canal. You’ll be happy to know that, according to the current literature, the five year success rate for root canals is over 90%.

It’s not uncommon for there to be some minor to moderate discomfort in the area after the root canal. It is normal for the tooth to be uncomfortable for 10 days after today’s treatment. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, the tooth and surrounding tissues may remain sore for a few weeks post treatment. This can be due to a number of factors which include soreness from the injection, soreness from placement of the rubber dam clip and from inflammation around the tip of the root. Inflammation is a normal part of the healing process as your body rids the area around the tip of the tooth of the remains of the infected pulp tissue. Your tooth may be sensitive to biting pressure or the tooth may even feel loose. It’s all the result of the inflammation and sensitivity of the nerve ending in the tissue just outside the end of the root where we cleaned, irrigated and placed filler and sealer material.

DO NOT eat or drink anything for the next half hour. DO NOT “check out” the area with your tongue or finger. You have a temporary filling in the tooth and it takes about half an hour to harden. You are also numb and may damage your tissues.

DO NOT use the tooth to bite down on anything hard (peanuts, pretzels, ice, etc.) until the permanent crown has been placed on the tooth. The tooth is prone to fracture and if you bite down on anything too hard or crunchy you may crack and ultimately lose the tooth. You will need to have the permanent crown or filling placed as soon as possible.

# WHAT DO I DO IF THERE’S DISCOMFORT?

The primary line of defense against discomfort is over the counter medication. We recommend that you take 600 mg ibuprofen (three over the counter pills of Advil, Motrin or
---
generic equivalent) every 6 hours for the next two days, OR if you are unable to take ibuprofen, 1000mg acetaminophen (two extra strength Tylenol or generic equivalent) every six to eight hours for the next two days. Most of the time this is enough to handle any discomfort. You may also be given a prescription for an antibiotic and/or a prescription for a pain reliever. Fill the prescription for the antibiotic and begin taking the medication. Fill the prescription for the pain reliever only if you need it. It is our goal to ensure that you are comfortable. If you have any questions or concerns I can be reached on my cell phone at 555.555.5555

# INFORMATION FOR DENTURE CARE

- It’s important that your dentures, like natural teeth, be kept free from plaque and tartar. This prevents permanent staining and bad breath. Use a denture brush and one of the many commercial cleaning products to thoroughly clean all of the surfaces of the denture at least once a day
- Rinse your dentures after eating.
- Using a soft bristled brush, brush your remaining teeth, as well as your tongue, palate and gums. This not only removes plaque and keeps your breath fresh, it also massages your gums and stimulates circulation, keeping your natural teeth and tissues healthy.
- Tough stains and tartar can be removed by soaking your dentures in white vinegar for several hours. After you’ve cleaned your dentures, always remember to rinse them in water before placing them back in your mouth.
- If your dentures have no metal parts, you can soak them in diluted bleach solution to remove tough stains. Never soak your dentures in a cleaning solution for more than 15 minutes if they have any metal parts. Be sure to rinse them thoroughly before placing them in your mouth.
- Whenever they are out of your mouth, your dentures should be stored in water.
- Your gums need to rest each day, so don’t wear your dentures to bed at night.
- See us regularly for examinations to ensure your dentures fit properly and your mouth stays healthy.
- Always let us know right away — call us at 555-555-5555— if you notice any changes in your bite or fit.

# Temporary Crown Instructions

- A temporary crown is less durable and meant to be easily removed by your doctor.
- Avoid eating hard, crunchy, or sticky foods until your permanent crown is ready.
- Avoid flossing directly around the temporary, this could cause it to loosen or come off.
- Please resume normal brushing immediately but be gentle around the temporary crown.
- Your gums may be sore for a few days following the procedure. You can rinse with warm salt water to help reduce pain and swelling. You can also take tylenol or ibuprofen as needed for the pain.
- It is normal to experience sensitivity to temperature and pressure following the procedure. This should pass after your mouth adapts to the temp crown.
- Your temp crown may be shaped differently than your original tooth. Your tongue may magnify these differences but you will become accustomed to them in a few days.
---
If your temp crown comes off during non-business hours, do not be alarmed. CVS and Walgreens sell temporary crown cement. Simply re-cement it with a small amount of this cement and call our office to schedule a follow up appointment.

# Care After Implant Surgery

Congratulations! You are the owner of a new dental implant. Implant surgery is 90% successful and in order to increase the chances of implant success it is important that you carefully follow these post surgery instructions.

1. Day of surgery do not disturb the area, avoid rinsing and spitting that day. A certain amount of bleeding is expected following surgery. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure to the surgical area for 90 minutes, then you may eat or drink. If bleeding persists, a moist tea bag should be held firmly in the area of bleeding for 90 minutes.
2. Ice the surgical area (side of face) for first 4 hours, apply ice 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off.
3. For pain relief: for the first 24 hours only, take 2 - 200mg tabs of ibuprofen with 2 - extra strength tylenol every 6 hours, after that take 600mg ibuprofen every 6 hours (it may be helpful to eat 30 minutes prior to taking pain medication to prevent nausea).
4. Antibiotics: Take as prescribed until they are gone.
5. Drink Plenty of fluids (do not use a straw).
6. Diet: A proper diet is essential to healing. Soft foods are recommended. Stay away from sharp brittle foods (no popcorn, potato chips, etc.) Try to chew on the non-operated side of your mouth. Avoid citrus fruits, fruit juices, highly spiced foods and alcohol; these will cause pain.
7. Do not smoke for AT LEAST the first 5 days following surgery.
8. Rinsing: starting the day after surgery, rinse with warm salt water every 2-3 hours. Begin the prescription anti-bacterial mouth rinse 3 days after surgery or after the wound is healed. Rinse 2-3 times per day for 60 seconds with the prescription mouth rinse, continue to also mix in rinsing with warm salt water. Avoid all other mouth rinses until the doctor has informed you that the surgical site is fully healed.
9. Avoiding toothpaste for 72 hours following surgery will help healing. Simply brush with warm water and DO NOT disturb the surgical site. Also remember to brush your tongue to keep bacteria growth down.
10. DO NOT Chew on any exposed portion of implant.
11. Bruising and swelling may occur. Swelling is usually proportional to the surgery involved and swelling is at its peak in the first 48-72 hours. To control swelling: Ice on and off for the first 48 hours and apply warm compresses (warm wash rag) after that. If swelling appears abnormal, inform our office immediately.
12. If your jaw is sore: chewing sugar-free gum may help loosen the muscles. Make sure to keep your jaw moving so that muscles don't lock up.

# Verbal Post-Operative Instructions

Every new assistant gets a small pocket size notebook and they print out the abbreviated post op instructions below. They then tape them in their notebook and we inform them “I don’t need you
---
to memorize the instructions, you can sit facing or stand behind the patient and read them off, but we must deliver verbal post op instructions in addition to the consents and written post op instructions. We also have videos on post op instructions for patients to reference.” (see below post op cheat sheet)

Pain is normal for the first few days/week. The worst pain will be on days 2 and 3. Continue to take pain meds as prescribed. You can add 2 tylenol in addition to the motrin every 4-6 hours.

# Rinsing

We want to give the blood clots a chance to set up, so do not rinse for the first 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can rinse with a warm salt water rinse (1 tsp/8oz of water).

# Eating and Drinking

Soft foods in the extracted area and drinking is fine. NO ALCOHOL!!!

# Root Canal Therapy

# Pain

To clear the infection and reduce the pain, continue taking antibiotics and pain reliever. You can add 2 tylenol in addition to the motrin every 4-6 hours.

# Verbal Post Op Instructions After Treatment

# Fillings

“Soreness at the injection site and gums are to be expected. The tooth will likely be sensitive to temperature (hot/cold) and biting for several weeks and in some cases up to a few months, this is very common with tooth colored fillings but gets better with time.”

“If your bite feels off, please call us right away so we can get you in to adjust it, it’s often hard to tell when you are numb.”

“Be careful with the area since you are numb. Wait to eat until it wears off because we don’t want you to hurt yourself by chewing your cheek or tongue.”

If Pulp cap “the cavity was very deep, therefore we placed some medicine under the filling to help protect the nerve of the tooth. This is something we want to monitor so if this tooth starts to give you trouble, let us know.”

# Temporary Crown Post Op Instructions

POI “please do not floss around your temporary- if you feel the need to floss, pop the floss down and then pull it out towards your cheek to avoid taking the crown off. Remember to stay away from hard and sticky foods. We recommend not eating on it for the next few weeks if you can avoid it. We will have you back in 3-4 weeks to deliver your permanent crown. Expect some sensitivity to the tooth and soreness in the area. This could last for a few days up to a few weeks or months- everybody is different. If the bite feels high at all please let us know so we can get you in to adjust it. If the temp falls out at all, simply recement with toothpaste and call us so we can re-cement it for you.”

# Endo and Oral Surgery

Tenderness is normal for 10 days, most discomfort is the first 72 hours after the procedure where inflammation is at its peak. (If given medications remind them to take as prescribed)

# Extraction

Tenderness is normal, most discomfort is the first 48-72 hours. Every patient is different, some heal about in 2 weeks and some can heal for about 6 months.

# Post-Operative Directions Checklist

We have clear post-operative instructions for most procedures, and are trained to speak to the highlights of each in the same manner. We train on the answers to the most frequently asked questions.

It can feel like boring repetition as you start to practice and become proficient in giving post-operative directions, however this is the first time each patient might be hearing these things. It is important to remember that this is a very critical part to the entire patient experience, and giving these directions out trains the patient on what to expect and will reduce the need for more phone calls or post-op appointments going forward.

# Chapter 10

# Dental Assistant Testing

As you start to hire and train new assistants into the office, you will want to make sure that they have the same knowledge as some of the other expert dental assistants. To adequately complete this onboarding process, you will want to give them tests about different aspects of their job to assess their competency. This next chapter includes tests around many different subjects, and can be used when onboarding your next assistant to the team.

In addition, have you ever sat down to do “training” and get caught up wondering “what am I going to train on” or worse, put off training because you need to “take time to write up training documents”? Don’t worry about this anymore! We found that turning training into a quiz format has led to quicker assistant growth and really nice engagement during calibration meetings. Simply grab one of these quizzes and go around the room, you will be amazed with the additional questions you get from the team and increased clarity that they have after going through quizzes as a group. (Note: you may have your own preferences that differ from ours, so update your quiz accordingly).

A digital copy of all of these tests are available in the downloadable documents section in the resources given with this book.

# Invisalign & Cosmetic Cases

Invisalign or clear aligner therapy is largely a team driven process. Once we have our dental assistants trained up on how the process goes, the providers should not have to do a ton of hands-on work with it. With that said, systems and efficiency are critical to case acceptance and setting the team up to delivery quality care of our patients. This chapter lays out all things invisalign for our practice. If you are an invisalign provider we recommend joining DSN and checking out DNTL.LIFE for awesome invisalign lab savings.

# Financial Arrangements

It has been our experience that invisalign is often an impulse buy. With that said we need to be able to quickly discuss financial options. We prefer the doctor grab this financial options sheet and sit shoulder to shoulder with the patient to discuss (this is following the presentation of how invisalign works and we know the patient is very interested in treatment). When they say “I need to think about it or talk to my spouse we have them take a photo.

Ideally we already know whether or not they have adult ortho coverage. The one side of this laminated sheet shows the cost in the event they have ortho coverage and the other side is with no ortho coverage. If they have more than $2,000 in ortho coverage then we just tell them how great that is and that their fee will be even lower than depicted here. Then the treatment coordinator has a binder with pre-printed financial arrangements for all of the ortho payment scenarios. They can quickly rip out the appropriate financial arrangement and bring that to the patient to sign and collect payment. We prefer this to the generic open dental print out because we have flexible payment options that aren’t quickly or easily depicted inside open dental. The Treatment Coordinator would scan the signed FA into the chart and make commlog notes about the financial arrangement discussion. When patient leaves they would enter the in office payment plan in open dental if appropriate.

# Invisalign Case Treatment Financial Workup

# A. Adult or Child that has In-Network Covered Orthodontic Coverage

Our Fee for Comprehensive Adult Orthodontics (D8090) is $5,900, with certain insurance companies that we are in-network with the allowed amount is less, for example Delta will honor $4,526. With invisalign treatment we incur a significant lab bill and in order to make this procedure profitable in our office we will need to make up the difference from insurance discounts. This will be done by utilizing an “upgrade lab fee” for premium orthodontic materials. It can be found by searching “Invisalign- including vivera retainers” in open dental codes. This code will NOT be sent to insurance and is an in house code. The fee for this will be customized to make up the difference between the insurance allowed amount and our fee of $5,900 and is ultimately the patient’s responsibility. In addition, the patient will need to sign the “material upgrade consent” form. This explains that invisalign is a premium material and it will include their vivera retainers after treatment is complete.

Verbiage for “material upgrade consent”: “Your insurance does not actually cover invisalign they cover basic orthodontics. This form explains that you understand that you are responsible for the invisalign upgrade.”

Double click on the highlighted area to change the “Fee”

*YOU WILL CHANGE THE FEE TO WHATEVER $ WILL ADD UP TO THE $5900 THAT WE CHARGE FOR INVISALIGN*

# A. Out of network and covered we bill our normal fee code D8090

# a. Adult or Child where Ortho is not a covered benefit

If orthodontics is not a covered benefit on the patients plan we are not required to honor the “In-Network” fee. Patient is responsible for the full fee (see document Payment Options: Invisalign, Implants, Cosmetic). D8090 will not be billed to insurance and the patient must sign “Request to Restrict Disclosure” form which explains that since this is not a covered benefit we will not be submitting this procedure to your insurance.

# MATERIAL/COSMETIC UPGRADE SERVICE AGREEMENT

At times our doctor(s) may recommend materials which are above and beyond what is covered by your Insurance Company, and/or included as a standard per the Current Dental Terminology as represented by the American Dental Association.

When the doctor feels the presented necessary treatment can be improved to create a more stationary restoration by utilizing an upgraded material, he/she will advise you to choose the upgraded materials as recommended.

As always, our doctor’s number one concern is to treat you with the most advanced material and services available to improve the outcome and longevity of a healthy smile.

“I understand the doctor has my best interest in mind. At this time, I am accepting upgraded materials at my doctor’s recommendation to better treat my present condition(s). I understand the upgrade of the materials, above and beyond what is covered by my insurance company, which can generate additional charges due over the standard fees agreed upon with my insurance company or dental network.”
