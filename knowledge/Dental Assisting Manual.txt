# Introduction

The dental assistant is one of the most important roles in the dental office. When a patient is nervous, the dental assistant is there to calm them down and help ease the nerves. When a doctor is doing a complex procedure, a dental assistant is there to create a sterile field and good visibility. And when the schedule gets hectic, a dental assistant is there to run between rooms to get back on schedule. In essence, a good dental assistant can make or break the quality of the work of the office, as well as the culture inside the office.

Through this book, we tried to point out the many areas where a dental assistant can start to learn their skills, where to grow their knowledge, and where to find mastery. If you are a dental assistant, we hope you find this book offers a lot of areas to learn, improve, and teach the next generation of assistants. If you are a doctor reading this book, we hope it offers a playbook on how to onboard, train and systemize your office so that you have the best right-hand help in the office.

Many of these ideas were boiled from previous iterations and through collaboration inside the Dental Success Network and the community we have both been a part of inside the private Dental Success Institute Mastermind with Dr. Mark Costes. We appreciate the constant sharing of ideas that has helped us become better - as they say, “Iron sharpens iron.” With that, we have tried to improve and create these resources so that you may not only execute on these ideas, but take this book and improve on these ideas in such a way that it makes your office, your workday, and your patient experience better.

With that, we are grateful to have been influenced by the assistants in our lives, including the Green Dental Care team and Kaelyn- dentistry is just more fun with you in the room. We are also grateful for the people who helped put this book together including Jenna, and Ashlee.

To your Success,

Chris Green, DMD

# Chapter 1

# Principles of Systemization for Assistants

Even though the doctor seems like the most prominent position in the office, we have found that the Dental Assistant is the glue that keeps everything together. Doctors give the injections, but assistants place the topical beforehand to make them painless. Doctors give the diagnosis, but assistants answer the questions and give clinical advice to the patient after the doctor leaves the room. Doctors might put all the treatment into the chart, but the assistant has to present the treatment plan and be able to talk about financial responsibility. A good doctor, it has been said, is only as good as their assistant.

Experienced doctors reading this book, already know well that a good assistant makes the day flow with ease. An untrained or sloppy assistant causes gray hair and stress. This book will walk both the doctor and assistant through the ideology of what a world-class assistant looks like.

To begin with what that looks like, it is important to remember that oftentimes a “rockstar” assistant means different things to different doctors. Sometimes it means being a conversation starter with patients to keep them talking and have their mind wander during the appointment. Sometimes it is the opposite where the dental assistant takes more of a clinical role and is on roller skates around the office doing more tasks. In any situation, the most important characteristic of a good situation is a consistent line of communication between the doctor and assistant. Sometimes that’s little mini-meetings in between patients, and sometimes that’s formal monthly accountability reviews. Whatever system your team chooses is fine, as long as there is a system. Having poor communication is the off-road ramp to poor results. That is why, as we start this book, we will review the meeting cadence and certain aspects that must be discussed during each meeting. These systems create a culture where assistants can know what is expected of them and can thrive in a clear environment.

# Core Systems

Since the dental office has multiple members working in a complex team, it is important to set and make sure that everyone knows the core values that define the practice from day one. Expressing this EARLY and OFTEN is key to finding and building the team mentality. As a dental practice, you often see patients that don’t feel comfortable in your office simply because it is a “dental office”. Putting the entire team in the right frame of mind and finding the right motivations - can elevate your patient experience beyond the dental chair and develop relationships that will last and provide dividends through free advertising in patient testimonials.

If you are the doctor or leader in the practice, start by finding your Mission, Vision, and Core Values, including - what you want your practice’s 1-2 sentence description to be. This is typically focused on the type of office you want to be for your employees and patients. Is your goal to provide a family atmosphere for your team members, is your goal to provide high-end implant procedures at an affordable cost, etc? These goals are very practice-specific and should be posted for your employees to see. Going through this process will help you to determine your Core Values.

As an assistant in the practice, you will want to be well versed in the core values, and how they impact the mission to help the practice achieve the vision that was set forth. If the doctor is with a patient and can’t answer a question, then you should be able to use the core values to know what the best answer is.

Core Values should be short, sweet, and to the point. Your goal is to make this easily memorizable for your team, so they never forget what the foundation is built on. Your core values should define the basic values you search for in each employee and patient interaction. Addressing each major aspect of your office functions can be accomplished by breaking each function down into simple bullet points. See the next page for our example. You may have as many or as few core values as you like, but we recommend limiting yourself to 4-6 values. Remember that each one should pack a punch and each member should feel the weight of the words when they read them, so choose your words with intention.

# Examples of Mission, Vision, and Core Values

# Mission

Our mission is to “Build long-term relationships between our team and our patients and provide quality, consumer-friendly dental services the whole family can value and afford in a happy environment.”

# Core Values

1. We make decisions based on what is best for the patients, the team, and the practice
2. Be fun, positive, and determined to make a difference
3. Be humble and Follow the Golden Rule
4. Mistakes will be made, be accountable, learn, and move forward
5. Be honest and respectful, Integrity is everything
6. Strive to Make everyone feel safe, valued and important

# Vision

A fulfilling team culture that is engaged with our community through acts of service and provides a welcoming/empathetic patient experience through genuine patient and team relationships. We lead with authenticity and are a full-cycle organization.

Everyone on the team should know the mission, vision, and core values. It helps managers hold their team members accountable, but it also makes it so that co-workers can hold each other accountable as well.

# Non-Negotiables

Now that everyone is on the same page in regard to the Mission, Vision, and Core Values, it will be easier to define your practice’s “non-negotiables.” In every successful dental office, there are commonalities- we call these the non-negotiable practices. These are the characteristics that demonstrate a successful practice. Maintaining this list of attributes and activities throughout your team creates continuity, from the first visit to everyone thereafter. Your patients shouldn’t feel the difference between assistants, doctors, or front staff. To know when you are doing it right, your patients will have the same genuine.
---
interactions with every member of the team and feel that everyone in the office has a personal stake in their care. This is a list of a few that we recommend that you adapt to your practice.

# Doctor

- The doctor always slows down, greets the patient with enthusiasm, sits and faces the patient, and gives post-op instructions.
- Assistant also summarizes post-op instructions
- The doctor tells them that if they need anything at all not to hesitate to call - even on a weekend.
- The doctor will sugar-coat the treatment, but not the diagnosis.

# Assistant/Hygiene

- We always summarize procedures/appointments and inform before we perform.
- We always give post-op instructions.
- We always edify our teammates.
- Every new patient sees the new patient slide show.
- We ask for a referral or a review when we receive a compliment.
- Every new hygiene patient receives a welcome call from the hygienist.
- Introduce yourself, invite the patient to follow you back and ask how their day is going.
- Don’t abandon the patient.
- Offer patients the Comfort Cart.
- We always have signed treatment plans.

# Front Desk

- Every patient who receives anesthesia receives a post-op call.
- Every patient is greeted as they walk in the door (even if we are on the phone).
- We are consistent: same level of service every time (try and keep patients with the same clinical team members (doctor, hygienist, assistant) whenever possible.
- We track all new patient referral sources.
- Offer water or drink while hanging out.
- We provide on-time appointments (if they must wait we move them to different stations to remove the feeling of waiting).
- Regular audits to keep our doctor and hygienist schedules full and productive.
(NOTE in the patient note section of Open Dental after we have done so in order to ensure we do not ask the same patient the same thing every time)

At certain points throughout this book, we will have a checklist of the things you will want to have in place as a summary of the previous part of the chapter. Below is the checklist for the foundational principles of the practice.
---
# Foundational Principles Checklist

- We have defined the Mission Statement for our practice.
- We have defined the Vision Statement for our practice.
- We have defined our Core Values for our practice.
- We have posted these foundational principles in a prominent place as well as in the Operations Manual.
- We have outlined a list of our “Non-Negotiables”.
- We keep notes in our Practice Management system to not ask repetitive questions of the patients.

Once you have taken the time and chiseled out your foundation, you are ready to start setting up systems throughout the rest of the practice to build an amazing assisting team. These systems usually start with team meetings, to always make sure you have a good line of communication.

# Meeting Cadence

Meetings are crucial to achieve a high level of systemization and to keep doctors and assistants on the same page. It is a good idea to have regular meetings between the leaders and a team member using different cadences of meetings. When these meetings occur, it creates a cadence of communication that helps team members know where they are falling short, or what they are doing well. We will go from the most frequent, which is also consequently the most important first:

1. Morning Huddles
2. Weekly Growth Meetings
3. Monthly All-Team Meetings
4. Bi-Annual Problem-Focused/Planning Meetings
5. Leadership Meetings

# Morning Huddle

Morning huddles are by far the most important of any of the meetings you need to have. Done each day, Morning huddles review the previous day’s ‘scoreboard’ measures and then prepare for the upcoming day. Usually, the review includes the previous day’s production, collections, new patients, and possibly any other important trailing key production indicator (KPI). In our offices, we have a divided white erase board, so that it is easy to see if we are on track with what our goals are. Each morning this is updated and then the team moves onto the current day’s schedule.

To be prepared for the morning huddle, sometimes we suggest that team members use a daily huddle preparation sheet. An example is shown next:
---
This sheet helps team members make notes about their schedule in case they need to bring anything up at the morning huddle. However, sometimes teams do not like to use the chart format, and would rather use the next format, where they list out patients with specific issues. While we give you multiple options for your morning huddle, there is no “correct way” here. Whatever works best for your office is the one you should use.

Each person should take maybe 30 seconds to run through their day to keep this meeting efficient by only discussing the most important information. As you go through the morning huddle, remember to keep it succinct but highlight the important information. After starting with the KPIs, you should have every person with a schedule go through and highlight any important items they need to talk about. This includes:

- Looking ahead to make sure all lab cases are in
- Making sure all parts are available for implants, intra-oral scans, etc.
- Looking for, and preparing for, same-day treatment
- Knowing which patients are required to make payments
- Assistants take 100% of the ownership of where to place emergency appointment slots

When assistants own the schedule, and know what to look for, then all the above items will become a habit and the days can be run without much unexpected stress.

As the employees list these points, others in the practice should be taking notes. As assistants run through their columns of patients, the rest of the team should listen for important things. As the doctor gives out more important daily reminders, everyone should be aware of the things that will apply to them. Next up is another example of a morning huddle data sheet that might help.
---
It’s always important to have a plan for the day and for assistants to know all about their patient so we are prepared. As you go from 2 to 4 or more assistants this level of organization becomes exponentially more important. We want to have a streamlined approach so we know our patients and what the appointment is for, and know which assistant will see which patient. These assignments may change slightly throughout the day due to the dynamics of each day in a dental office, but at least we start with a good idea of who’s responsible for which patient.

# Impact Activity for Morning Huddle

In our practice, we talk about having a positive impact on our team and patients as being the greatest KPI to the culture and patient experience. During the morning huddle we want each team member to reflect on ways they’ve made a positive impact in our practice - this is a list of examples they might share.

# Examples of making a positive impact on the team and patients…

# Lead

- Read notes on patient, unique story that we could positively impact
- Researching insurance
- Filling hygiene holes (ASAP list)
- New patient paperwork
- Confirmations
- “I’m going to talk to hygiene patient about same day tx/ rest patient about other tx”
- “I’m going to give ___ a VIP experience”
- Audits
- Precollecting

# Patient

- Time saved
- Saved Money (max ins.)
- Improved Health -- quality of life improvement?
- Anxiety reduction
- Quality time referral
- Educate the patient on something
- Gifts that patients sent back
- VIP experience

# Team Impact

- Me + _____ worked together on a project
- Gift
- Acknowledgement

Tip: To purchase the needed supplies for this setup, go to this Link on Amazon and order the listed supplies:

After all patients are discussed and the doctor gives their main points, the front desk and office manager might have things they need to touch base on. This could include any emergency open times for the day, or administrative tasks that need attention. This will ensure that if someone needs to get in for an emergency, they are put in the correct time slot, rather than an incorrect slot which will cause undue stress on the schedule.

At the end of a huddle, we always end with a note of positivity, either a quote, joke, or story. On Fridays, we read the most recent Google reviews, and give away small awards in our “Jar of Awesome”. This jar is a place where people write a small note about another employee and how that employee helped them, did something great, or just lived out the core values of the practice somehow. After reading all the slips out loud, one is chosen at random. Both the employee and the person who nominated them receive $15 gift cards.
---
# Weekly Growth Meetings

These weekly meetings are typically held during the day sometime during the week, and they focus on practicing hitting the Wildly Important Goals, or WIGs. WIGs are typically 3-5 large goals that would mean success for the practice if achieved. These need to be very mathematically driven so that there is no ambiguity as to whether they were achieved or not. This could include production numbers, collections, Google Reviews, new patient totals, the number of a certain procedure, or some other thing that is easily trackable. At this weekly growth meeting, each person will tell the entire group something that they will do that will directly impact the WIG goal. This action they say out loud and write down will be something that is trackable and something that will then be followed up with during the next weekly meeting.

For example, a dental assistant might say, “I will ask each and every patient for a Google Review.” In the case where your WIG is Google Reviews, this will help a lot in that regard.

These meetings should last maybe 15-20 minutes, and the items should be written down by someone in the meeting. The meeting should generally be held with everyone in the office, but if someone is gone that day, then they get to submit their growth item later and then it is added to the list. In cases where the team is split up into multiple groups, then sometimes you can have two meetings.

Assistants need to pick items that will make a meaningful change for the doctor and practice. Doctors will also need to pick a goal, and this could include anything such as asking for Google Reviews, doing employee monthly reviews, offering same-day treatment at least once per day, or any other leading indicator.

# Monthly All Team Meetings

Even though you have morning huddles and weekly growth meetings, sometimes you still need hour-long monthly meetings to address all the other items that are needed in an office. This could include time for OSHA training, HIPAA training, clinical updates on procedures, and training on other stuff in the office for systemization. These meetings will usually only be one hour long, and they will be led by either the Office Manager or Doctor.

# Bi-Annual Meetings

These meetings are usually 3-4 hours, held about once or twice per year. These meetings will mix operational systemization tasks as well as team-building. The team-building aspects can be funny games, team-building exercises, or social activities at the end of the meeting. The actual crux of the meeting is to share the Wildly Important Goals, and new major initiatives at the practice, and come up with solutions to everyday problems.
---
One way to facilitate the problem-solving part of this meeting is to follow the EOS model. A simple way to do this is to have all the team members say out loud all the problems or issues that they’ve seen in the practice over the past few months. One person writes all these issues on a whiteboard. Then the long list is simplified into some issues that might be connected to each other. The list will then get shorter and condensed as issues are connected to each other so that when one is solved, it might solve a larger, more far-reaching issue.

# Leadership Meetings

If your practice is large enough to warrant it, you may consider a separate leadership meeting. While the morning huddles, weekly growth meetings, and monthly meetings are for everyone, these weekly leadership meetings are only for the department heads, or just for the doctor and office manager. If your office is large enough to have department heads for assisting, hygiene, or the front office, this might include more people.

These meetings could have a few different goals. In one scenario, these meetings could be tailored towards developing these people into better leaders. This might include discussing leadership qualities, reading books together, and going through exercises to make sure that these leaders are learning more techniques and practices that will help them lead their respective teams better. A few of the books that we have enjoyed are The Servant by James Hunter, The Ideal Team Player by Patrick Lencioni, and Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. We also have a leadership text chain and discuss podcasts, articles you have read, and other interesting leadership items.

These leadership meetings also allow time where hard decisions can be made in a more private setting. Difficult decisions often need to be made before being announced to the team, so these meetings offer a place to do that while discussing with the leaders who have more insight into how their team might react to those decisions.

# Systemization Checklist

- We have a meeting cadence that works in our office.
- We have Morning Huddle and use sheets to help make sure all information is passed along.
- We have important annual goals set up for our practice to achieve the success we want.

This wraps up the systemization and structure of the back office. While dental offices can run without this level of systemization, the data we have seen show that well-systemized offices usually are happier, run better production, and are able to pay more for their team. Time is money, as we have heard again and again, and so we understand that this level of systemization will take many hours to reach. It is important to remember that the hours of work to get to this level do not stop once you become the ‘city on a hill’ type of setup. Contrary to that belief, maintaining this level of operation will mean hours and
---
meetings continually. However, once you get these meetings and systems in place, the profitability of the office will go up and the stress levels in the office for everyone will decrease.

The end goal of systemization is to keep crucial tasks from falling through the cracks while reducing the stresses in the office. Investing the time on creating structure and systemization in your office will alleviate costly and emotional issues in the long run.

As an assistant or a doctor, see your time used on these tasks as an investment in your future. Focusing on the right inputs, meetings, and systems, will ensure that days flow easier for everyone in the future.

# New to Dentistry

If you are a Dental Assistant who is just joining the dental field, then we are excited for you! The dental field can sometimes be tough as many patients have a fear of the dental office. However, there are many things that make our industry one of the best including the joys of either getting patients out of pain, or giving them a smile that they’ve wanted for decades. When patients can’t stop grinning because of their new smile, it can be an amazing feeling. Dental offices also have a small ‘family’ environment. Whereas in a hospital or larger medical facility, you might not know your co-workers well, in a dental office you can have a close-knit group of friends.

However, dentistry can also seem crazy complicated. You have many ideas competing for space in your brain as you learn all these new things. You have:

- A Front Desk with complicated financial arrangements
- A Sterilization area where odd-looking instruments are in packets and vibrating machines
- Other team members who are rushed to keep patients on schedule
- And a Doctor who is stressed about lab work, patient care, and running a business.

It can sometimes seem like a whirlwind as you step into this environment. In any case, it helps to gain a perspective of the industry as a whole, before you continue your journey into dental assisting. To get a firm grasp on everything in a dental office, we recommend a 3-hour video called “Rookie to Rockstar-Dentistry 101” from Front Office Academy. If your doctor is not a member of Front Office Academy yet they can sign up here.

Rookie to Rockstar-Dentistry 101 comes with a 60-page printable packet, which helps as you watch the videos. An example of that packet is found below:

# Dental Language and Terms

Verbal skills are extremely critical as we talk to patients. If our communication skills are weak, there is a strong possibility our patients will never experience our clinical skills. It is essential that we understand what we are talking about and how to present information to the patient in such a way that it puts them at ease and instills confidence that we will treat them with kindness, using the latest dental technology to ensure the most comfortable and excellent treatment possible.

Our patients need to know that we care about them personally before they are able to hear how we can help them clinically. So, the way to start this is to begin relationship building from the very first contact. We always recommend that you begin with a short 3-question conversation as we begin the appointment. Ask about your patient’s interests. Ask about their family. Then, please make note of these things in the patient’s chart as we don’t want to ask repetitive questions in the future. Try to mix their first name into the questions and discussion as well so that you can remember their name.

# Example Personal Questions to get a Conversation Started:

1. “How did you hear about our practice?” (If they are a new patient)
2. “Are you from around here?”
3. “What sort of work do you do for a living?” (Or if they look older - “did you do for a living?”)
4. “What’s your favorite thing about your career?”
5. “Have any fun trips planned for these next few months?”
6. “What has been your favorite vacation? Would you go to the same place again?”
7. “What hobbies and activities keep you busy?”
8. “Are you traveling at all for (upcoming holiday)?”
9. “Do you have family nearby?”
10. “Have you been watching any good television shows or movies recently?”
11. And finally, “That’s really interesting, tell me more about that…..”

Once you finish getting to know them as a person, you can then start to do the clinical items. We always recommend that anyone doing any clinical work ask at least three questions so that we can get at least a friendly rapport with the patient before doing any work. Three questions also give the patient time to relax and get to know us, so that if they need to tell us anything, they will hopefully be more relaxed and feel comfortable communicating with us.

# First Visit Scripting

If this is their first visit, you will want to explain that “we will be gathering information, including photos and x-rays, that will go into our records and assist us in assessing your oral health”. This allows the patient to know exactly what the next steps are so that they understand the process for appointment.

After stating our goals, then we can move on to the next part in explaining our recommendations. “We will evaluate your existing fillings to determine how well they are holding up. If they are still holding
---
up, we will not recommend replacing them. If they are beginning to break down, we will talk about options. This process helps you see what we see and helps us eliminate most dental emergencies by being able to see what is beginning to break down before it is advanced.

If patients have not had dental treatment for a few years or have extensive treatment needs, we explain that we will help them see what needs to be taken care of and that we can break it down into a plan that works for them. It is our job to let them know what needs they have, what options are available, both clinically and financially, and that they will be the ones who make the decision as to how they want to proceed. “We are here for you.”

# Clinical Tip

Three basic kinds of restorations are fillings, inlays/onlays, and crowns. The type of restorations recommended is based on the amount of sound tooth structure remaining. Fillings are bonded into the preparation. Inlays/onlays are used when there is not enough tooth structure remaining to support a filling, but enough left that it doesn’t need the full coverage of a crown. The greatest amount of support is a crown, which covers the full tooth. It is made of gold, ceramic or porcelain.

If the patient starts their journey in the hygienist's room, the hygienist should review any clinical findings with the patient, pointing out areas of concern that they will want to discuss with the doctor. This helps them begin to understand the condition of their dental health and helps them mentally prepare for accepting the treatment they need.

# Categories of Dental Problems

Generally, a doctor or hygienist will categorize problems into four major categories:

1. Periodontal Structure - this includes looking at the gums and bone structure around the teeth. If there is inflammation, bleeding, calculus, or large amounts of plaque then a more complex treatment might be needed.
2. Tooth Structure - this includes looking for cavities, cracks, or other tooth problems. This might also include talking to the patient about replacing missing teeth with bridges, implants, or denture options.
3. Bite and Wear - this category focuses on if the patients possibly grind their teeth and have flattened bite surfaces, or whether other problems are occurring with how the teeth are arranged in the mouth. If a patient needs orthodontics (braces or Invisalign), this is also the time to discuss that.
4. Esthetics - Some patients really want the most straight, white teeth possible, and this is when you would ask about their goals with their smile, to possibly help them achieve the perfectly straight, white “Hollywood Smile”.

# Terminology and Software in Dentistry

In this next section, we will review as many of the terms as possible so that you are not caught off-guard if a doctor or other team member asks you about something. We will start with many of the software that are used in the dental office.

- DentalXChange
The clearinghouse that runs the insurance submission of claims, verification of benefits available to patients, sending paper statements to patients, accepting online payments from those bills, as well as sending back ERAs (electronic claims) to your practice management system.

Payconnect is the division of DentalXChange that processes credit card payments made by patients.
- Flex
The online paperwork system that:

- Sends out New Patient paperwork the day that someone creates an appointment
- Allows for treatment presentation
- Online forms and medical history forms to be filled out via iPad in clinic

# Insurance and Front Desk Terms

24
---
# Guarantor

Person assigned to account who may not be the patient, but who is ultimately responsible for payment

# Subscriber

Insurance term meaning the person who is the originator of the insurance, ie. the mother who works at the University...would be the subscriber for the entire family

# Insurance Claim

After a batch of procedures are completed, a ‘Claim’ is created that sends information to the insurance company as to which procedures were completed, what we charged, as well as any images attached to the claim. Most are submitted digitally

# Carrier

Insurance Companies like Metlife, Blue Cross Blue Shield, or Ameritas

# Group Name

Usually the group name is the company that purchases the insurance for their employees

# Fee Schedule

We have an internal fee schedule which is the fees we charge for each procedure. Each Carrier also has their own fee schedule which we individually negotiate with each carrier

# Medicaid

Medicaid is a state-run program that helps low-income people who need medical care or dental care.

# Medicare

Medicare is a health program for people who are over 65 and have left the workforce. The plain Medicare program doesn’t include dental coverage although they can buy 3rd party plans that will be sold through a medicare marketplace.

Tip: Sometimes it is hard to remember the difference between Medicaid and Medicare. Try to think that you give ‘Aid’ to the poor, and ‘Care’ to the old. Medicaid is for the poor and low-income, whereas Medicare is for people over 65 years old.

# EOB (Explanation of Benefits)

An EOB is a paper document from the insurance company that tells us exactly what was billed, what the allowable charges were, what was not allowable, what they will pay for, and what the patient still owes.

# ERA

This is an electronic version of an EOB. It is in a digital format which allows it to be uploaded into our patient management system, Open Dental.

# Clinical

# Abscess

an infection of a tooth, soft tissue, or bone usually drainage is seen with yellow pus

# Open Dental Basics for Assistants

Open Dental software, a widely adopted open-source solution for dental practice management. The program commences by introducing the concept of open-source software and highlights the numerous benefits of using Open Dental, including its compatibility with various third-party applications and its collaborative community-driven development. This is a powerful incentive for dental practitioners, as it grants them flexibility and choice, reducing dependency on proprietary systems.

The outline then proceeds to meticulously explore the Open Dental interface, including its various toolbars and module-specific features, ensuring a thorough understanding of how to navigate the software effectively. It breaks down the patient flow process, from appointment scheduling to patient check-out, providing a detailed roadmap for dental professionals to streamline their practice operations.

Furthermore, the program emphasizes the importance of generating end-of-day reports, such as payment reports and claims tracking, which are crucial for monitoring practice performance and financial health.

In addition to software navigation, the program equips dental professionals with essential skills in appointment scheduling, managing patient information, handling payments, and planning treatments. These practical insights not only enhance daily practice operations but also empower dental staff to provide a higher level of patient care and streamline administrative tasks. Overall, this program is a comprehensive resource that ensures dental professionals are well-prepared to harness the full potential of Open Dental in their clinics, optimizing practice management and improving patient services.

# Why Open Dental?

Many of us in the Dental Success Network use Open Dental, and there are a myriad of reasons for this. Primarily it is because it works well with many other software, and because of its ‘open’ structure, you can build other software that will pair well with it.

# What is Open-Source Software?

It is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder (Open Dental) grants users (you!) the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. It is not wholly owned by a corporation or company like many of the other practice management software options.
---
# What are the Benefits of Using Open-Source Software?

Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond those of a single company. The Open Dental User Community is the driving force behind software updates. You get to vote on and drive software development!

The source code is accessible to third-party developers who can develop robust add-on software that syncs seamlessly with Open Dental. This gives you the choice of clearinghouses, billing companies, forms, confirmations, texting, emailing software, etc. It plays well with others! You are not tied to proprietary software. The availability of the source code enables those who can code with MySQL the ability to write custom reports.

It is important now that you learn the Open Dental Screen Layout and review modules. We suggest that the best resources and videos are actually created by the Open Dental software themselves. Here is a link to the YouTube Channel for the Open Dental Software: Open Dental Software YouTube Channel

Below is a list of things that we believe every assistant should review while watching these videos.

# Top Toolbars

The most important place to start is to review Top Toolbars: Title Tool Bar, Management Tool Bar, Patient Tool Bar, and Module Specific Tool Bar. After you understand this, then you will want to understand the patient flow, including the main steps involved in moving a patient through an appointment.

# Appointments:

- Overview of a patient appointment from arrival to dismissal
- Making or finding an appointment:
- Finding a patient and scheduling an appointment using the quick procedures.
- Finding an existing appointment.

# Pre-appointment Information Gathering

Do I have the correct patient information? (Family Module Patient Info Screen)

Do I have the correct insurance information? (Family Module Insurance Plan)

# Patient Arrival to The Office

- Marking Patient Arrived
- Checking Patient Info and Insurance Info if not done in Step Two.
- Marking “Patient Ready”

# Patient Goes to Operatory

Marking Patient In Treatment Room

# Open Dental Quick Tips and Tricks

# Scheduling

When scheduling the patient it is important to keep in mind that your schedule is controlled by you and not the patient. You want to find a time that works best for the patient, but within the parameters you set up. Maximizing your schedule is important and your scheduling goals come first. In this pattern, patients should be offered the times that you would like to schedule them, and they can choose a time that they will be able to make work within their schedule.
---
Each doctor should also have their times for each procedure provided to all members of the office for reference when scheduling. These times should be uniform for most circumstances and the team should all know the times that are needed for each procedure. We suggest using a uniform sheet that everyone in the office is trained for. Attached later in this chapter is the “Doctor Time Key” which tells each team member how much time is needed for each appointment. It is also included in the downloads for this book.

In our scheduling philosophy, scheduling times are always given in three numbers:

1. Assistant Time (signaled by the 0)
2. Captive Doctor Time (signaled by the X)
3. Assistant Time (signaled by the 0)

The first assistant time is the time to set up the appointment, seat the patient, and get them numb for whatever the procedure calls for. This means there is some actual doctor time, but usually can be limited to a few minutes and the doctor can “pop-in” and out again to go do other things.

The second time is what we call Captive Doctor Time, where the doctor needs to be in the room and dedicated to that patient. This can sometimes be interrupted, but for the most part the doctor can’t leave the room to do another significant procedure.

The third time is assistant time again. This is for the assistant to finish up the procedure, clean the room, and sterilize the instruments if needed. This is where the Doctor can leave and go do another procedure.

As an example, let's look at a very simple double filling for a doctor with a time of 10-20-10. The First 10 minutes is the assistant time and where the doctor can come in to give anesthetic to the patient. The second twenty minutes is to accomplish the #19 and #30 Occlusal fillings. After finishing the filling, the doctor will give final instructions and leave the room. Then the assistant will walk the patient to the front desk to check out, after which they can clean the room, and take instruments back to the sterilization area.

Similarly, a crown preparation appointment might be a 20-30-20. The first twenty minutes is to set up the room, give anesthetic, take any needed radiographs, take any pre-operative impressions, and take a shade. The second thirty minutes is to actually prepare the tooth and place any buildup that is needed. At the end of that doctor time, the doctor can place the impression, and then leave the room. The next, and final, twenty minutes is for the assistant to explain post op care, clean the room, and take instruments back to the sterilization area.
---
When operating with one column per doctor it is important to alternate a high production and a low production (at the very least) to balance the day. Sometimes this works out so that the time the patient is looking for is also a time that you would usually schedule a patient but this will not always happen. Keep in mind the principals we just went over - try to find the appropriate amount of time for the appointment, not longer than needed, and not try to pack extra procedures into a short amount of time. Appointments that are dismissed early leave money on the table where time could have been filled with other treatments if planned appropriately. Similarly, appointments that are short, but trying to get too many procedures done, stress out the doctor and team and possibly start the cascading waterfall of running behind on the schedule. (See the next image for an example of one column scheduling.)

In the scenario shown in the example, the doctor runs solely out of 1 operatory. In this example, all procedures, large and small, must fit into this operatory with abutting assistant time in between each appointment. While this is necessary when a doctor only is able to work out of 1 operatory, it is wildly inefficient.

This same scheduling can be done in Hygiene, although most of the time the hygienist is the only person using and running their rooms. Remember that the Hygienist and the doctor will be indicated by the X in the column. We recommend leveraging the color coordination to demonstrate the difference between the doctor and the hygienist when utilizing an accelerated hygiene schedule. In this scenario of accelerated hygiene where there is 1 hygienist and 1 assistant, the X will demonstrate the time that the hygienist is with the patient instead of an assistant. (see example later in the next section)

If we are looking at efficient 2 column scheduling, then the image on the next page is a great example of a perfect use of two columns which also resulted in more than $10,000 in net production for the doctor’s schedule in the example day.

Notice that the assistant time of the first appointment is overlapping with the captive doctor time of the second appointment. This happens back and forth in each column throughout the day, making sure that the doctor is always busy. It is important to also realize that the doctor will most likely also have to perform hygiene exams throughout the day as well, so these appointment times need to be long enough to both take care of their doctor work, as well as see exams.

Typically when scheduling two columns for a general dentist you want column one to have all the high production. Column two should have all low production as well as “conversion” appointments.

43
---
Simply put:

1. Op 1: High Production Procedures
2. Op 2: Low Production Procedures, Exams with possible conversions

Conversion appointments are appointments with the opportunity to be converted from an exam (limited) to treatment. This can be tailored for each doctor as they prefer. If the doctor prefers to run the first column as doing all the primary procedures, the second column may also be known as a “Flex” column. This is an area on the schedule to demonstrate an empty operatory to be utilized for any provider needing an additional chair, including hygiene. This is the bonus column that you can schedule mainly assistant driven procedures.

In some cases of doctors who prefer to remain extra busy, or who have the available operatories, you may choose to set up 3 operatories for doctor utilization. In this scenario:

1. Op 1: High Production Procedures
2. Op 2: Low Production Procedures, Exams with possible conversions
3. Op 3: Assistant-Only Procedures (Whitening, Impressions, Nightguard seats, Sleep Appliance exams)

Remember that in the scenario of 3 operatories, the third operatory can virtually never expect the doctor to be present. This means that any appointments scheduled in this third operatory must be
---
Typically we recommend saving this for impressions, whitening, seating nightguards, and other procedures that take no doctor captive time.

Sometimes in a multiple doctor clinic, one of the doctors is out for the day. If a provider is out for any reason, you will want to leverage a flex column. Recommended treatment for this column would be the same as the 3rd operatory column previously discussed including in-office whitening, impressions for whitening trays, impressions/delivery for occlusal guard, minor adjustments for denture/partials and teledentistry consults. Additionally this column should have an assistant assigned to it. When the assistant is not working with patients, they should be working up front to cover phones or helping around the office as needed. Keep in mind that a double scheduled provider may struggle with a flex column, so always check with your provider before opening a flex column.

planned. As you set up a room for this patient, you will want to be keenly aware of what is planned and anticipate all the required supplies. If there is a crown prep attached, you will want to be ready with possibly a new diamond bur. If there’s a filling attached, you will want to be ready with a matrix band and system to hold the filling material in place. If there is a crown seat, you will want to have the cement ready.

# New to Dentistry Checklist

We have implemented a system to train up new-to-dentistry employees. We have trained and role played on personal questions to help get to know a patient. We have practiced the scripting of a patient appointment to know when to say certain verbiage. We have given and reviewed a document that lists the softwares used in the office. We have explained the most common front desk and insurance terminology. We have explained the clinical terms used in dentistry. If using Open Dental, we have given them the resources and videos to learn Open Dental in a timely fashion.

# BASIC INSURANCE KNOWLEDGE

Below you will find information around insurance protocols and billing protocols around some of the most common procedures and categories of procedures. These are important to look over and review, because when steps are not taken correctly, it can often lead to the insurance company not paying for a procedure. This leads to more billing problems and angry patients.

# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

# New Patient without insurance

- Take FMX (Full Mouth Series of X-rays) per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

# Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

- Send on Claim: FMX only D0210
- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X-rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 4 Posterior PAs)
- A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional X-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional X-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment etc.
- Take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL
- If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X-rays

- Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)
- Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim!
---
- Take 4 BW-X-rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA xrays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA xrays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X-rays

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X-rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get BW-X-rays)
- Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 2 BW-X-rays D0272 and Pano D0330
- Send on Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X-rays D0272

# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X-rays. (under 6, try and get BW-X-rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance
- Send on Claim: 2 BW-X-rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY

- If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.
- If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW and 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!
- If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

- Take 4 BW-X-rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- Pay careful attention to any note from insurance coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to patient portion.
- This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
---
If deductible applies to all xrays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect deductible amount from patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW xrays if they are not covered @ 100%.

If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional xrays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion.

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)

If the patient is eligible for a FMX and

# What Xrays, Images and Info is Needed Based on Services

# Buildup and/or Crown

- PRE-OP Xrays and IOs - always take a preoperative PA even on posterior teeth, as BWs are getting denied as insufficient
- IN PROGRESS IOs to show the extent of decay and need for BU/CRN
- NEED TO SEE THAT MORE THAN 50% OF TOOTH IS MISSING TO JUSTIFY PAYMENT FOR BUILDUP
- POST-OP Xrays and IOs
- Crown Seat BW/PA
- If an Endo was done (or prior/existing endo), you must take a PA in addition to BW on prep date and be sure to include FULL apices of tooth
- INCLUDE IN CHART NOTE IF BU/CRN IS INITIAL OR REPLACEMENT!
- If there was existing buildup or crown, need date of prior placement and reason for replacing
- Include DX and REASON for treatment

# Endo

- PRE-OP XRAY (PA) -- must Include full apices of tooth
- POST-OP XRAY (PA) -- Includes full apices of tooth
- Must take PA AFTER bite block and any other instruments have been removed so insurance does not think it’s an “in-progress” xray

# Implants

- PANOS ARE HELPFUL IF WE ARE REPLACING MULTIPLE TEETH (OR IF THERE ARE OTHER IMPLANTS/BRIDGES ALREADY IN THE SAME ARCH)
- Pre-Op, In-Progress and Final Xrays and IOs
- Can be BW/PA/Pano as long as the site of tooth being replaced is visible
- If tooth is extracted at our office, include pre- and post-extraction films
- MUST KNOW Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?
- BE MINDFUL OF MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE!
- Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!

# Bridges/Dentures
---
# Dental Treatment Guidelines

# 1. Panoramic X-rays (Panos)

- Panos are helpful if we are replacing multiple teeth (or if there are other implants/bridges already in the same arch)
- Same x-ray/IOs needed as for Crowns
- Need tooth-by-tooth narrative
- Teeth being replaced and reasoning
- Include in Chart Note if it is Initial vs. Replacement
- If replacement, include date of previous prosthesis, reason for replacing
- Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?
- Be mindful of Missing Tooth Clause!
- Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!
- Expected prognosis for longevity of bridge
- Missing Tooth Clause = If a tooth was missing prior to the patient's insurance coverage going into effect, the implant/bridge to replace the tooth is not covered!

# 2. SRP (Scaling and Root Planing)

- Be sure we have x-rays (BW and PAs) of all teeth that receive SRP.
- Bitewings need to show all the way to gum line
- Sometimes we only have BWs on file from NP appt, and will need to take additional PAs of the anterior teeth for submission to insurance
- A Pano will NOT be accepted by insurance - must take BWs and PAs for SRP
- IOs can be helpful if x-rays are not strongly indicative of need for SRP, if pt has significant bleeding upon probing, etc.
- Must also have Perio Charting that was done within the last 6 months
- Pocket depths should be at least 5 mm+
- Co-morbidities/Health Hx can be useful as well, include in chart note

# 3. Orthodontics (Ortho)

- Must have PANO
- Expected Duration of Treatment
- See Ortho Billing protocol especially for CIGNA patients

# 4. Wisdom Teeth Extraction

- Must have PANO
- Obtain pt’s medical insurance info in case we need to bill to it for 3rds

# 5. CIGNA Insurance - Billing Protocol for Buildup and Crown

If a patient has CIGNA insurance, we cannot bill out for a buildup and crown on the same day, as the buildup will be considered “inclusive of” the crown, and we will not get paid for that service.
---
# PROTOCOL:

1. Create Treatment Plan
1. Treatment Coordinator will add only the codes D2950 (Buildup) and D2740 (Crown) when creating treatment plans to present to patient
2. Collect for BOTH services on or before the PREP date appointment
3. Once Treatment plan has been presented to the patient
1. Add CignaCrownPREP and CignaCrownSEAT codes to patient’s chart
4. Schedule the PREP Appointment by Including 3 Codes:
1. D2950 (Buildup), D2740 (Crown) and CignaCrownPREP
1. This will block off enough time for the appointment, and indicate to the provider which services to complete as normal
5. At time of PREP Appointment
1. REMOVE/DESELECT the Crown (D2740) from the appointment BEFORE setting services complete
1. This will prevent our office from billing for the crown on the prep date. The CignaCrownPREP code will still remain attached to the appointment so that we know a crown was done
2. The Crown (D2740) code should now be moved to the SEAT appointment
6. Submit Claim for Prep Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2950 ON THE CLAIM
1. D2740 should not be attached to this DOS once appointment is completed
2. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code
7. If Collecting the patient portion at time of service on Prep Date
1. DO collect for both Buildup and Crown!
8. Schedule the patient’s Crown SEAT Appointment in 3-4 weeks
1. Include 2 Codes: D2740 (Crown) and CignaCrownSEAT
1. This will indicate that the crown has already been done and we are simply cementing the permanent crown, but we need to BILL for the Crown at this appointment
9. At time of SEAT Appointment
1. KEEP both codes (D2740 and CignaCrownSEAT) selected and Set complete
2. BILL for the crown D2740
10. Submit Claim for SEAT Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2740 ON THE CLAIM
1. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code

# Codes and Terms to Know:

- “Prep Date”
- This is the date that the Buildup and Crown are both “done”, and we would normally bill for both services on the prep date, except when the patient has Cigna insurance! If patient has Cigna, ONLY BILL for the Buildup
---
- “Seat Date”
- The appointment 3-4 weeks later when the permanent crown is cemented. This is the date to submit the crown if the patient has Cigna insurance!
- D2950 - Core Buildup
- Should always be billed on the “Prep” date
- D2740 - Crown (Porcelain/Ceramic)
- Pt has Cigna INS - Bill on “Seat” date
- Pt has other INS (that pays for crown and bu same day) - Bill on “Prep” date
- CignaCrownPREP - Dummy code to indicate crown service was done but not billed yet
- Attach to “Prep” Date appointment
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance
- CignaCrownSEAT - Dummy code to indicate the correct date to bill for the Crown
- Attach to “Seat” Date appointment in addition to Crown (D2740)
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance

# Diagnosis Terms

In order for assistants to properly communicate to the doctors and write more complete chart notes, it is important for assistants to get familiar with terms referring to various tooth diagnosis and other oral conditions. Here is a list of terms that every assistant needs to know. Put yourself in the Doctor’s shoes and try to diagnose before the Doctor comes into the room.

- Caries - Cavity (Synonym)
- Faulty Restorations - Open Margin
- Weak Restoration/Teeth - Structurally weak tooth or restoration
- Fractures/Cracks
- Missing Tooth
- Missing restoration (missing fillings, crown, etc.)
- Infection/Abscess
- Infection at apex = PARL (periapical radiolucency)
- Bruxism - Wear
- Jaw Pain
- Dry Mouth
- Cosmetics - Veneers
- Crown recement- poor/loss of retention
- Pulp
- Necrotic - Dead
- Symptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis - Needs Endo - (when the pt has symptoms like hot/cold sensitivity that lingers)
- Asymptomatic Irreversible Pulpitis - Needs Endo - (when the pt does not have any symptoms like the ones listed above)
- Reversible Pulpitis - Cavity close to nerve or cold sensitivity that is not lingering (less than 20 sec)
---
# Dental Terminology

- Abfraction - caused by clenching (a wedge at gumline of tooth)
- Abrasion - caused by grinding (wear from the abrasiveness of hard bristle toothbrush)
- Impacted 3rd Molars
- Rampant decay - decay everywhere
- Hopeless dentition - hopeless teeth (needs to come out)
- High in occlusion (bite is high)
- Pericoronitis (swelling/infection of gum flaps over back molars)
- Failing endo
- Infection in furcation - infection between the roots
- Symptomatic Apical Periodontitis (painful to tap on the tooth)
- Asymptomatic Apical Periodontitis (not painful to tap)

We know that after reading this chapter, it may seem like dentistry is a different language. Quite honestly, all the new terminology and understanding probably does add up to new language. Hundreds of words, abbreviations, new ideas, and processes that you have never heard of. It probably seems totally impossible to learn at this point, however over time you will build up the knowledge that will allow you to communicate with your team and master this new language. As you progress through the learning process, start small and add a little knowledge every day. Building slowly, along with repetition, will help you learn this new language.

# New to Dentistry Checklist

- We have implemented a system to teach basic insurance billing protocols to team members.
- We have trained on what images and x-rays are needed for certain procedures.
- We have practiced the terminology used by many insurance companies, including Cigna.

As you master this new domain, you will be able to seamlessly switch between talking to patients and conversing with team members. As you gain this deep understanding, only then does it become even more important to transform yourself from a simple dental assistant to a “great” dental assistant. Now that you have a basic understanding of dentistry and some of the terms, we will now attack how a great dental assistant should be on-boarded, with the correct systems.

# Chapter 3

# Onboarding a Dental Assistant

The onboarding of an employee can make or break the future trajectory of that person. If done poorly, it can lead to disaffection, perceived laziness, and generally a bad feeling on both sides of the relationship. These unmet expectations can lead to the employer being angry and frustrated, and the employee feeling like they are floating in limbo about expectations that were never truly explained to them. However, if done well, it can lead to amazing outcomes. The onboarding experience is such a huge part of the overall systemization that we will devote an early chapter in this book to it.

# New Employee Hiring Systems

We will start, even before the employee is hired, at the time of evaluating whether or not you should even hire. In this respect, you will have a process, such as the checklist below. As you scale it becomes increasingly hard to ensure that we check all boxes to properly onboard new team members. This list ensures we cover the basics during the hiring process. We would recommend creating something similar based on your new hire onboarding systems.

# Sample 90 day check in tracking sheet

The first 90 days with a new employee are critical. This is the dating period that helps us determine if we made a good hire. More importantly, when this process is done well we can really super charge their development with our practice. It is on us to ensure that they are getting the training needed and invite them to the standards of our practice. The following is a 90 day checklist to ensure we are maintaining all of the check-ins with a new employee during the first 90 days. It keeps us all disciplined and on track. Typically a lead will perform weekly check-ins and bi-weekly longer check in’s plus every 30 days a more formal one on one type check-in. During these meetings we are looking for opportunities to answer questions, provide more clarity on any training they have received and focus on next steps forward. After 90 days the individual is now through their “orientation period” and will be assigned a regular time each month for their one on one.

# Sample ABC Dental Care Request for Time Away Form

When requesting time away, we ask the team for redundancies. This ensures that we have proper coverage and that they have done their part to make it a seamless process. This form is utilized in addition to their request in our HR software and handed in to their lead or OM. As a third step in the process they are asked to write down the coverage arrangements as well as write a note in open dental to make sure everyone knows “Susie in for Jenny”. Finally, we ask that if they do switch and they’re a dental assistant that they switch with someone of similar skill set.

Tip: You can even create a paperless system where employees can fill out a Google Form which automatically puts this data into a spreadsheet, with a timestamp of when it happened.

At ABC Dental Care everyone on our team works hard as a cohesive unit. It’s important that all team members are on time and stay late when necessary to support our patients and fellow teammates. In the event a team member requires a day off, has to come late or leave early, it impacts the entire team and flow of the day, however, things do come up and when they do we need to know as far in advance as possible so we can prepare and make sure our patients and teammates have the necessary support.

- We require 21 days notice to switch shift/ leaving early/ coming in late/ taking half day; unless approved by Office Manager/Owner for emergency purposes
- We require 30 days notice for single day excused absences.
- We require 90 days notice for 2 or more days
- Everyone is encouraged to take personal vacations with the designated time off as an office.

This form needs to be filled out completely and returned to your team lead and signed by team members.

We have found that one of the core pieces to a hyper-performing practice is regularly scheduled, well run meetings. Every team member has a 1 on 1 each month. It is their responsibility to go to the person assigned to conducting their 1 on 1. When we stay on track with 1 on 1s team members are more clear on our expectations, they are more in alignment with the practice, and they are able to grow faster because they are invested in their own future. One on ones help us to head off big problems in the practice or correct small problems before they get large. There are 3 main components: Culture Check in, KPI check in, processes and growth check in. We also recommend a master spreadsheet showing what day of the month and time each person’s one on one is and with who. One on ones should take 20 minutes. If you “don’t have time” to perform these important meetings then you are making time for putting out fires instead. These meetings are meant for the team members, for us as leaders to get to know them better and help them grow, they are not for complaining.

# Accountability Agreement

I __________________________________, understand that my responsibilities as a Dental Assistant include, but are not limited to the duties listed on the following documents:

1. Dental Assistant Job Description
2. Dental Assistant Daily Task Sheet and Weekly Task Lists
3. Room Setups, Protocols and Procedures

Additionally I am aware of Example Dental’s core values as listed below and will strive to conduct myself in a manner consistent with these values:

# Example Dental Core Values:

- Fantastic guest experience
- Always be improving
- Hungry and Humbly confident
- Have each other’s backs

Team Member Signature: ____________________________________ Date: _____

Practice Owner (CEO) Signature: ____________________________________ Date: _____

# List of Other Documents to be given in Onboarding Packet:

- Employee Handbook
- Retirement Plan Information
- Health Insurance Plan Information
---
The previous few pages show an example packet, but a digital download is available for this position as well as other examples in the downloads for this book.

There are a couple items seen in the packet that weren’t discussed yet: the Monthly Assessments and 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Cadence. In dental offices, many times the leadership/dentist is just too busy to hold employees accountable and do job performance reviews with the team members at an adequate cadence. Usually these meetings/assessments only occur about once a year when an employee wants a raise. One way to improve the communication and increase the cadence of accountability is to have monthly assessments with your team. These quick 15-20 minute meetings minimize the biases out of a big annual review.

In this packet, we offered two versions of a Monthly Assessment. One is a 20+ question version rated on 1-5, and the other is a mix of core values and questions.

# How should you execute the monthly assessment?

A copy of this 20+ question assessment is to be filled out by both the team member as well as their leader, and then they review the sheet together. In the areas where there is improvement needed, notes are made and that is followed up in the weeks after the assessment. This usually gives the leader and team member a chance to escape the whirlwind of the office, and to actually talk about job performance in a setting that is constructive. We recommend every month for these, but some doctors can get the same efficacy out of bi-monthly meetings. In those cases where the long-form questions are done bi-monthly, you can always fill in-between months with a quick core values survey or some other assessment of skills.

# 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Cadence

The other part of the onboarding packet that is extremely impactful is the 30-60-90 day onboarding cadence. Whenever a new employee joins the practice, it is important to make sure that they know what is expected as they learn the operation and grow into their position. “30-60-90” means that you will check in with them every 30 days during the first 3 months of their employment, and ensure they are meeting the standards that are required of them during this process. If they meet all the standards of the 30 day list, then they get to move onto the 60 day list. In the case where an accountability isn’t met to the level of satisfaction, then it is added to the next list. In cases where the new employee isn’t meeting the standards, and success does not look likely, then it might become an issue where termination is the option to avoid further headaches. Within 90 days of onboarding with your practice, the employee should be fully immersed in the culture and fully able to execute all portions of the job.

# Video Onboarding Checklist

Sometimes there is a higher level of detail that is needed to pass along information about your office. In that case, maybe it is easier to make videos and host those videos for your office and on-boarding. Below is an example chart that Dr. Owner had made for his office. After each employee watched each video, they would initial the chart. After showing the Doctor or lead assistant they were proficient, then their leader would also initial that box. This is not a comprehensive list, it is just a sample size to give you an.

idea of how to build your own video vault for team training. We recommend using the youtube page linked to your practice gmail account to upload videos as “Not Public” and hyperlink the links to those videos inside various written systems that they apply to as well as creating a complete video vault checklist like below. In the past we would say to new hires “go ahead and watch the training videos on youtube.” What we found was they would watch a couple, but because the searchability is a bit difficult and because we were not crystal clear on the expectations they ended up missing a ton of videos. By having a checklist that gets signed off on, we now know they are getting the education that we expect.

We found over time that showing a new assistant the above spreadsheet can be overwhelming. As a result we decided for new assistants we want them to get really good at about 5 skills over the first 2-3 weeks then they can add the next 5 foundational skills. We selected these skills based on the thought process “if a new assistant can take these more time consuming, less skill oriented tasks off our more senior assistants plate, then the senior assistant is freed up to perform the higher level skills with more complex procedures.” This helps the office continue to run smoothly. Additionally, newer assistants get up to speed WAY faster by knowing they only have to focus on chunks of skills at a time. Once they have a strong foundation they are able to flourish as they add additional skills to their tool belt. As a dentist, if you’re anything like me, we have so much in our head, we sometimes don’t even know where to start. So let's follow the KISS principle and start here. This is especially valuable when you are in a situation where you may have been short handed and are caught onboarding someone while the senior assistants have less time to train or you are onboarding multiple assistants at the same time. AGAIN some of these skills are ok in the state of Colorado and may not be ok in your state for a dental assistant to perform.

For every type of procedure or skill that an assistant might need to become proficient with we created a spreadsheet for “check-offs”. In the past I would ask an assistant “Hey how many times have you made a temporary crown?” and they would respond “Oh yeah I’ve made a few”. Then I would say “a few like 2 or a few like 15?”. They never quite seemed to know, and this was across the board for a variety of procedures. So we leveled up and decided we wanted them to check off a certain number of times performing, or assisting on each procedure before moving on to the next. So for example, we want them to view over the shoulder assisting on 3 crowns, then assist on 3 crowns themself with a senior assistant helping them, then make 5 temps on typodonts before making temps on a patient and so on and so forth. The following is a small sample size, for the purposes of this book we have not printed the whole list.

# Exam Sheet to become Proficient With

The following 2 images are laminated back to back and situated on the 12 o’clock counter in every restorative op. The assistants fill this out. It has 2 purposes. Firstly, it is a checklist to make sure the assistant has completely set up their room & gathered all of the correct photos and x-rays. Additionally, it tells us why the patient is here. One side is for an existing patient that is here for scheduled treatment and the other side is for a new or existing patient emergency.

# When Mastery Starts to Occur

With newer assistants, we need to teach them the standards of patient care and the most important skills that we want them to master. As they progress, there will be certain things that will become second nature. Here are some of the fundamentals that all great assistants in our practice have mastered. This is a simple list, and the next chapter will address this in more detail.

# Restorative Fundamentals

- Smooth NP Work Up
- Handoffs with NDTR and Flex Communication
- High Quality IOs and X-ray (labeling)
- Relationship Building
- Master Pre/Post Op Verbiage
- Post Op Calls
- 10 Point Checklist
- Think Ahead

# When should I get a Treatment Coordinator (TC)?

# Hygiene

- Use best judgment based on size of Treatment Plan
- For NP doctor exam after cleaning or hygiene perio diagnosis
---
# Restorative → Hyg

- If NP workup going to hygiene:
- Complete workup checklist
- Cosmetic photos, slideshow, FORM, pano, CBCT, IO, FMX, clean as you go, patient ID, patient photo, scanning insurance card
- Determine if you need to by time...getting water while patient “hangs out” - Doctor exam in hygiene after hygiene appointment

# Restorative Emergency

- Use emergency workup checklist
- Emerald - use the best judgment for TC
- All other assistants get TC/Doctor after signing workup checklist

# Onboarding Checklist

We have an onboarding checklist to track applicants through hiring stages. We have systems to teach new employees about their pay and benefits in a simple manner. We created a packet to give to new employees that includes:

- Job Description
- Checklists to be proficient in (Including End of Day Sheet)
- Key Production Indicators (If applicable in your office)
- 30-60-90 Day Onboarding Cadence
- Monthly Assessments
- Accountability Agreement
- List of other documents to be given

We created a system to track and teach new employees on certain procedures. We have videos to teach on all the main systems of the practice. We have an exam sheet or route sheet that teaches all the items needed for certain exam appointments.

As you can tell, the old systems of hiring and just putting next to another employee for the first 2 weeks just will not cut it anymore. This leads to so many problems down the line, and these will often manifest themselves in burn out, early exits, or possibly termination. This chapter has given you the good foundation needed to build up new employees as they enter your dental practice, but that doesn’t stop there. The next chapter addresses some of the key things that take an assistant from average levels to “greatness”.

# Chapter 4

# Foundations of a Great Dental Assistant

We can all think of people we have worked with in the past who were great. These people understood what it took to get the job done, they had the instincts to be one step ahead, and they had the capacity to get it done making it look easy for them. In dental assisting, that is the foundation for greatness as well. In this chapter, we will introduce you to a systemized approach to achieve that goal.

Even though we understand those key points, each dental office is different. In order to gain a clear understanding of the meaning of greatness in your office, we will go through a systemized approach to help you find out your systemization, and how those goals can be communicated.

To start this systemization process, we will need to identify and separate many of the duties shared by the assistants on the clinical side of the practice. Sometimes these duties all add up and make it seem unmanageable. However, there are strategies that allow a back office to run efficiently, which include a clear structure and separation of duties.

# Separating Tasks

Creating a clear structure will help everyone, especially when duties start to overlap. One of the first things to accomplish is to evaluate what all responsibilities will be done inside the back office versus those that will be outsourced. When evaluating this, make sure to note which duties are going to be handled by each person, and whether those duties may be excessive for one person. Sterilization and back office cleanliness are often shared responsibilities between members of the back office. Sometimes sharing duties creates apathy since that person can say, “That was supposed to be her today.” Knowing how to assign and mitigate such responsibilities between team members will increase overall efficiency of back office procedures.
---
# Onboarding

In this chapter we share 2 different, but similar approaches to onboarding a new dental assistant into our office. The dental assistant position has the potential to be a higher turnover position in the office for multiple reasons, one of which is dental employees tend to use the dental assistant position as a launchpad to the next level of ascension in their career. These folks take their job and growth seriously, as leaders our goal is always that if people do leave, that we sent them off to their next phase better than we found them. In any case, we still have a business to run and a critical skill that helps cultivate a more resilient dental practice is the ability to onboard and quickly train up assistants. We can typically get assistants up to speed in accomplishing the necessary skills that occupy 80% of our time (new patient workups, basic chairside assisting, sterilization, flippings rooms etc) within 30 days. Mastery and the addition of the more complex skills of course take longer, but also make up closer to 20% of what we’re doing, and we have found with a strong foundation, assistants will grow towards mastery and the addition of more complex skills more quickly because they have momentum. You’ll see in this chapter that we tend to break up onboarding into a 30-60-90 day format.

# Example List of Back Office Duties:

- Turn On/Off suction pumps and compressor
- Set up for appointments
- Check that all lab cases are scheduled
- Confirm the days lab cases are in office
- Check schedule 1 day/1 week in advance
- Maintain cleanliness of operatories
- Run instruments through ultrasonic/package
- Assisting restorative/surgical procedures
- Clinical charting and Tx planning
- Order office supplies
- Equipment maintenance
- Turning On/Off oxygen and nitrous
- Check with hygiene for efficiency
- Complete mandatory lab work
- Review office cleaning checklist
- Restock rooms
- Take out trash at the end of the day
- Load autoclave with packaged instruments for sterilization
- Phone skills and scripts (The Three E’s) - when helping answer phones
- Proficiency in taking radiographs
---
After figuring out the daily, weekly, and monthly duties for each person, you will want to make sure to list each of these on their job description, as well as End-of-Day sheets. You will want to ensure that each person has a specific set of duties that are clearly outlined, and that their duties are clearly delineated from others in the office. In essence, there should be clear guidance as to where their duties start and stop, and where those differ from another person’s duties.

This delineation of duties helps in many ways. It sets clear expectations for each position, so that if you were to do an assessment on their job performance, you can see whether they are accomplishing their delegated tasks. In another way, this clear outline of each position also helps make sure that things aren’t getting neglected. Clear communication in this realm helps to make sure that the minuscule or boring duties aren’t forgotten. Occasionally when a duty is neglected once, it snowballs and keeps getting looked over going forward. When this happens, it can lead to catastrophic consequences such as forgetting to send a case to the lab which results in an unhappy patient. If this occurs on too many occasions, it is not uncommon for a patient to leave the practice.

On the next page is an example of an End-of-Day Sheet that is available in the digital downloads for this book:

97
---
98
---
This daily sheet includes morning tasks, down-time tasks, and end-of-day tasks so that everything is in one place. When they complete these tasks every day, each team member can take a picture and post it to a Slack channel, just like this picture shows:

We use Slack and have created an EODSheets “channel”, which is a specific text-like chain for these forms. This gives a permanent record of team members completing their sheet, and supervisors can quickly check it off.

These sheets are laminated, but written on with permanent marker, not dry erase markers. The permanent marker is erasable with alcohol and a paper towel or napkin. Regular dry erase markers are problematic, because the writing comes off anytime it rubs up against something more abrasive like clothing or your finger. To start creating these EOD sheets per position, use the templates provided in this book, and then start to edit from there.

The first step is to print these out on paper for the first week to make sure they are accurate and usable, before printing them on colored paper and laminating them once the list is finalized. It is common that as people move in and out of positions, and technology changes, these sheets might change every year or so.

When putting these systems together for each position, remember that accountability is the number one reason for success in using these systems. This includes weekly meetings at first, moving on to 30-60-90 meetings over the first 90 days, as well as monthly assessments thereafter. In the case where
---
Accountability is lacking, new employees are often left to figure out things on their own, which may lead to doing things in a wrong fashion or being blissfully unaware that they were expected to do certain tasks in a certain way. This can lead to frustrations in the team and build up resentment towards a new employee with an attitude that, “They just don’t cut it in this office.”

Systemization of the Clinical team should also include clear lines of leadership and who manages/leads the next level. Essentially, you need an organizational chart with clear lines of communication. One popular software that can give you the visuals of this is called LucidChart, and the graphic shown next is an example of what a typical dental office might look like:

Another way to make sure these duties are clear is to make detailed task lists of exactly how these parts of the job are done at each step. We call this “Checklists to be proficient in”. For example, the end of day sheet might include “Clean Bathroom”. However, to adequately clean the bathroom, it might actually include 10 different steps. In that case, there should be a detailed list of what that includes so that it is done correctly every time. These detailed sub-lists can help make sure that each duty is executed to the level and quality that is expected, which sometimes either takes lots of teaching, or lots of accountability towards that person.

# Prioritization of Tasks During the Day

We’ve noticed a critical skill set for any dental assistant is being able to think a few steps ahead. We also want our assistants 100% ready to go when the doc enters an operatory.
---
With many tasks being added to a dental assistant, it is sometimes difficult to know what is most important. In order to achieve greatness, there needs to be a clear understanding of what is the “most important” tasks and prioritize those throughout the day. One such example is that vacuuming the hallway is not as important when there is a patient sitting in the waiting room for 25 minutes. How many times during the day is the assistant “waiting” in the op with the patient while the doc is doing an exam in another room. Make sure that you have a general and clear understanding of what is most important for your office. This checklist is for their reference because there is no idle time, there is always something to be done or something else to prepare for. Here’s an example of how to prioritize items:

# First Priority: Patient Care and Appointments

- Room set up accordingly for procedure
- X-ray up behind patient
- Crown splitter needed
- Pre-Op/Post-Op instructions and consents reviewed/signed
- Seat patient in chair
- Blood pressure taken
- Topical anesthetic placed
- Anesthetic
- Can a Hygienist get a patient numb?
- FORM: (build rapport with patient)
- FORM stands for: Family, Occupation, Recreation, Motivation - it is a great framework for building rapport with patients and we record the answers in the space below the tooth chart in Open Dental
- Next appointment (remaining treatment - recall)
- Read insurance notes carefully
- Collect
- Prescriptions
- Pre-Lim

# Second Priority

- Sterilization
- Check in drawer for instruments needed for upcoming patients
- Check ultrasonic and bag all instruments (ready for next cycle)
- Empty and run sterilizer as needed

# Third Priority

- Setup for next patients (Don’t focus only on “your” next patient)
- Flip rooms (if necessary)
- Ask other assistants if they need help
- Pour up or trim models (if needed)
- Write notes
- See if hygiene needs help (get back next patient and do workup)
- Crown Appointments (things to consider…)
- Initial or replacement
- If replacement get initial delivery month and year from patient
---
- We have all necessary PA’s, BWs, IO’s
- Lab slip and shade
- Control bleeding for impression or scan

# Fourth Priority: Daily Checklist

- Prioritize tasks on daily checklist based on immediate need and time of day

# Final Priority: Downtime Checklist

# Emergency Protocols

Any “great” dental assistant will also have the knowledge and skills to manage a medical emergency in the office. The following section will brush up assistants on the skills needed to help manage any situation. A first time and basic understanding of medical emergencies will come from a Basic Life Support (BLS) class or Medical emergencies seminar, but this can help to refresh the knowledge.

# Basic Emergency Equipment

The first part of being prepared for any medical emergency is making sure you have the right equipment. Here is a sample list of all the equipment that most dental offices should have:

# General

- AED: An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a medical device designed to analyze the heart rhythm and deliver an electric shock to victims of ventricular fibrillation to restore the heart rhythm to normal
- Pulse oximeter - finger device to measure heart rate and oxygen saturation from the finger
- Blood Pressure Cuff
- Stethoscope

# Oxygen Delivery System

- Delivers positive pressure oxygen
- Must maintain a patent airway
- Must have an airtight seal of mask on face
- Various sizes of masks
- Includes: Mask, lines, small Oxygen tank

# Suction System and Tips

- Tips need to be large diameter and rounded to suction vomitus and blood (high vacuum suction)
- Manual suction if power goes out (Sometimes hand powered)

# Crash Cart Supplies

A ‘Crash Cart’ is a cart full of emergency equipment and medications in the case where medical staff need to execute emergency resuscitation on a patient. Here is a common list to have on-hand for emergency situations:
---

---
# Emergency Protocols in Action

Whenever a situation occurs, it is best to have duties assigned to “who does what”. In the following notes, we discuss who should do specific duties.

# Doctor or First to arrive

- Performs basic life support
- Administers medications

# First Clinical Assistant

- Notifies TWO other assistants for help
- Gets emergency kit
- Passes drugs and equipment
- Helps administer basic life support
- Ventilates patient

# Second Clinical Assistant

- Calls 911- STAY ON THE PHONE
- States the MEDICAL EMERGENCY (ie: Respiratory Depression)
- States “This is a DENTAL office, not a medical office- and there is no physician present”

# Third Clinical Assistant

- Monitors vital signs
- Record keeping, use Vital Signs Recording Sheet
- Alerts admin to CODE BLUE
- Admin team member will go outside and wait for EMS to arrive
- Make sure EMS is escorted to office and room where emergency is being managed
---
# Emergency Road Map

When an emergency occurs, it is important to have a system for evaluating the situation, the patient, and the steps in order to make sure nothing is missed. Here is the steps that we recommend that you should follow:

# Recognition

- Unconsciousness
- Altered consciousness
- Respiratory difficulty
- Seizure
- Drug related emergency
- Chest Pain

# Steps to Follow

1. Discontinue treatment
2. Assess level of consciousness
3. Position patient accordingly
4. Suction if needed

# Assess Consciousness

1. ALERT - is pt aware of surroundings?
2. VERBAL - can patient respond to questions?
3. PAIN - does patient react to peripheral pain?
4. UNRESPONSIVE - to verbal command or pain - CALL 911

# Position - if unconscious:

1. Place patient in supine position
2. Elevate feet slightly above head
3. P-CAB’s if needed

# Reassess Patient

# Medical Emergencies and their Management

Medical emergencies happen everywhere in daily life, but the stress of a dental office and the medications used can sometimes have an additive effect on these situations. Here is a quick review of the most common medical emergencies that occur in a dental office. These situations will help you decide how to manage them, and can help the team respond quicker when these things happen in stressful situations.

# We will review:

- Syncope (Fainting)
- Allergic Reactions
- Hypoglycemia/Insulin Shock
- Convulsions- Seizures
- Bronchospasm (Asthma)
- Vomiting, Aspiration and Choking
- Hypotension
- Angina Pectoris (chest pain)
- Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Arrest
- Hyperventilation
---
# Syncope

50% of all dental emergencies are produced by a sudden drop in blood pressure which decreases oxygen supply to the brain. This is called Syncope- or Fainting.

# Symptoms:

- Dizziness associated with fainting
- Patient feels warm, is pale, sweaty, nauseous and tachycardic
- Patient may feel nauseous for the next 24 hours

# Management:

1. Position patient in supine position
2. Elevate legs
3. Administer oxygen
4. Administer ammonia inhalant (if needed)
1. If no recovery in SECONDS, CALL 911
5. Observe for one hour- should not leave office alone

107
---
# Allergic Reactions

A hypersensitive state acquired through exposure to an allergen or re-exposure that produces a heightened capacity to react.

- Reactions can be mild, delayed (up to 48 hrs), immediate or life threatening
- 15% of all adverse drug reactions are immunologic or true allergies
- N2O/O2 has never been known to elicit an allergic response
- A good thorough history is crucial

# Types of responses:

- Skin Reactions - symptoms include urticaria (smooth, elevated patches of skin with itchiness), erythema and angioedema
- Respiratory Reactions - symptoms include bronchospasm, local edema of larynx leading to airway obstruction
- Anaphylaxis - the most acute and life threatening, death can occur in minutes.
- Symptoms include: nausea, itchiness, flushing, hives on face and chest, vomiting, cramps
- Respiratory symptoms follow: tightness in chest, coughing, wheezing
- Cardiovascular symptoms follow: pallar, lightheadedness, palpitations, tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, loss of consciousness, and finally cardiac arrest
- This is known as anaphylactic shock

# Skin Reactions:

1. Administer an antihistamine or benadryl
- Child under 6yo: 1.2 tsp to 1 tsp (12.5mg per tsp)
- Child (6-12yrs): 1-2 tsp (12.5mg per tsp)
- Child over 12- Adult (>60kg): 2-4 tsp (12.5mg per tsp)
2. Continue with oral benadryl for 3-5 days prescribed before leaving
3. Refer to an allergist/consult with a physician

If severe reaction:

1. Epinephrine IM or SC Note: onset of action for IM is 10min (peaks at 30 min), oral takes 60 min and is not effective
2. Call 911 or have medical consultation before discharge

# Respiratory Reactions

1. Refer to Bronchospasm section
2. Laryngeal Edema
1. Place patient in supine position and elevate legs
2. Administer Epinephrine IM from preloaded syringe
---
# Generalized Anaphylaxis

1. Call 911
2. Supine position
3. Institute BLS
1. Monitor and record vital signs
2. Administer oxygen
3. CPR
4. Administer epinephrine 1:1000 concentration sub Q
1. 0.3-0.5mg/kg ADULT
2. 0.01 mg/kg CHILD
5. Administer benadryl (diphenhydramine) IM in front of upper leg
1. 50mg ADULT
2. 25mg CHILD (approx 1cc)
6. Should see resolution in minutes
7. Administer second dose, if necessary
8. When stable, give benadryl IM in front of upper leg to decrease chance of recurrence
9. Contact MD for consultation of admission to hospital for monitoring
---
# Hypoglycemia/Insulin Shock

# Needle Stick/Exposure Protocol

Any great assistant will hopefully not ever get stuck with a needle. However, sometimes random things happen and any number of employees in the office have had this occur. When it does, the question inevitably arises- What should I do if I get a needle stick or exposure at work?

# Protocol

- Wash needlesticks and cuts with soap and water right away, Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water for 5 mins. Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants for 5 mins.
- Report the incident to your supervisor as soon as possible.
- Call Company Care (or your local urgent care clinic) and notify that the staff member is coming for exposure.
- Document the incident at work with time of exposure and if possible leave for labs as soon as possible.
- Notify the source that they will be required to also go in for blood work with the following information for Company Care as well.
- If the source is under IV sedation or if the patient wanted to do PRD drawl we could take the source blood into company care with the exposed patient.
- Staff members should have the Source patients' information ready to go for the exposed patient to take into Company Care (or local Quick Care Clinic that might specialize in workplace injuries).

Now that we have gone through what a “great” dental assistant looks like, it is important to review once again the principles of greatness. It starts with understanding everyone’s tasks and where your tasks end versus another assistant or team member. It continues as you make sure that each team member knows their position in the office, including who is their leader and who they might oversee. As tasks start to pile up, the next most important thing is to understand which tasks are important at that certain point in time. Sometimes there are many items on our “to-do” lists, and knowing the priority is of utmost importance. At the end of the day, it is then critical that everyone completes their sheets so that all important tasks are completed.

As new team members join the office, it is critical that they get a complete and thorough on-boarding. This includes all of the previous items talked about, but even includes details such as smaller checklists and how to complete them. It will also include a system for holding this person accountable in the on-boarding process. As they start to learn the practice, you will slowly increase responsibilities and at 30 days, 60 days and 90 days. This is all outlined well in the Onboarding Packet. As this person transitions from the onboarding period into normal conditions, you will then keep this person accountable to the office systems by holding monthly accountability reviews to make sure they are completing everything in their job duties.

Finally, a great dental assistant is one that handles emergency situations with expert knowledge. While we hope that no situations ever occur, we need to be prepared for them and know exactly how to manage them. A great dental assistant will keep up all the emergency equipment, know the duties of each person in a situation, and be able to identify many of the most common medical emergencies that occur frequently in a dental office.

# Foundational Principles Checklist

- We have separated tasks amongst team members in our practice.
- We have prioritized tasks to know what is most important at that moment in time.
- We have an organizational chart with a clear understanding of everyone’s positions and roles.
- We have an End-of-Day sheet for each assistant.
- We have a system to keep everyone accountable for their End of Day sheets.
- We have a complete OnBoarding Packet for the Assistant position.
- We have videos or other resources to help complete training for those new to our office.
- We have a good understanding of the Emergency Protocols in the office.
- We have a good understanding of the most common medical emergencies in the dental office.
- We have a system for keeping emergency medications and equipment up to date.

# Chapter 5

# Patient Communication

Clear communication is a critical skill in any business. A big focus in any dental practice is verbiage, “what we say” and “how we deliver” what we are saying. New team members (even if they’ve been in dental a while) need to learn the “language” of your dental practice. This evolution usually goes something like this:

- Discovery - they are discovering a new language and way of communicating. This can be overwhelming so we need to simplify this for them (a good example of this is how we get dental assistants up to speed with communicating post op instructions which we share in the post op section).
- Regurgitate - at this stage they have now heard the verbiage enough that they can repeat it to a patient, but don’t quite understand what they are saying well enough to go “off-script” and put it in their own words.
- Mastery - Now they know what to say and understand what they’re saying, thus can put the verbiage into words that are comfortable to them.

Building rapport and having ways to describe treatment to patients are case acceptance skills that help us drive more revenue to the practice. Less important for the back office, but when answering phones the two conversations that can make or break a practice are insurance conversations and combating cancellations. Below you will find our process for building rapport, buzz words for creating urgency, what to say and not to say in the dental office, handling cancellation and insurance questions and much more.

One last relationship building “trick” that we utilize in our practice is to capture what we call FORM on every patient.

- F: Family - marital status, kids, grandkids etc
- O: Occupation - their profession, job
- R: Recreation - what they do for fun
---
# Motivation

This can be a catch all for if they’re proactive or reactive, if they have a Night Guard already or don’t want to replace that tooth that they’ve been missing for years (so we don’t bug them with the same comments every time), if they’ve expressed interest in cosmetic treatment or invisalign or any other helpful notes.

This template is types in the section under the tooth chart in the CHART module in Open Dental.

# Building Rapport

Here’s a few tips on how to quickly build rapport with patients so that you can break down the facade that sometimes patients put up when they are nervous.

- Address the patient by their name (if you don’t know how to pronounce their name, ask them and write down the pronunciation)
- Give the Patient an Honest Compliment (Find something you genuinely like)
- Emphasize similarities (things you have in common)
- Make them feel important
- Let them talk about themself
- Ask then listen, don’t do all of the talking, find a topic the patient enjoys
- How did you hear about us?
- Have you lived in the area for a while now?
- Do you have any kids / grandkids?
- Do you have a lot of family in the area?
- Be Polite, Ask a Question and then LISTEN
- Active Listening: “I understand…” “uh-huh…”
- Repeat back / summarize what the patient just said, put their feelings into words for them
- Key Words: Of Course, Absolutely, My Pleasure, Thank you, Yes
- Who can we thank for referring you to our office?
- How did you hear about our office?
- Why did you leave your last dentist?
- Only talk about things that are of interest to the patient
- Complete FORM
- How was your last appointment with us?
- Ask then listen, don’t do all of the talking, once you find a topic the patient is interested in they will talk your ear off about it
- Try to read the patient, use non-verbal cues
- I see you work at…
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Where do / did you go to school?
---
# Discussing Treatment

- BUZZ WORDS: Worse, Painful, Now, More Expensive, Problems
- The Doctor is recommending this treatment because if you don’t do it there is a high probability your tooth will crack and cause you pain and then it will be much more expensive to fix
- What are your expectations for today’s appointment?
- Patients appreciate an explanation of the procedure to be done
- Patients are visual
- Take a HIGH QUALITY intra-oral photo to show the patient the tooth (dry the tooth free of saliva!) take an intra-oral picture of a healthy tooth in their mouth and say this is what a healthy tooth looks like then take a picture of the problematic tooth
- Play an education video
- Get a model
- What is it you were looking for when you were in search of a new dentist?
- When a patient asks you what do you think is going on…respond… “Well I can say for sure, we’ll have to wait for the dentist to know exactly what you need, but it looks like you might need…”
- Most of our Patients choose…
- I’m not going to lie to you, you’ll be very sore, but it’s better than the discomfort you’d have to go through to replace the tooth

# Say This not That

What we say & how we say it matters. Here are some words to avoid:

- Hang out NOT wait
- Insurance friendly/directly contracted/ participate with NOT out of network
- Courtesy NOT discount
- Patient Portion / Responsibility NOT Balance
- NEVER EVER SAY OUR POLICY
- Discomfort NOT pain
- Conservative NOT just/small (“just a small filling”)
- Numb NOT shot
- Most of our patients take advantage of the benefits of fluoride NOT do you usually get fluoride
- Complimentary NOT free
- Appointment change NOT cancellation
- Luckily/thankfully NOT unfortunately
- Verify insurance NOT run insurance
- Let’s go ahead and get you scheduled NOT do you want to get scheduled
- Pre-Collecting - Let’s go ahead and take care of that NOT do you want to…
- Fifty one - o - eight NOT five thousand one hundred and eight
- Directly Contracted NOT out of network
---
# Benefits NOT insurance

NEVER EVER EVER TALK ABOUT DELTA PPO vs. PREMIER on a NP call- you can call them back and tell them if you found out it was PPO only

# Question and Answers

Here are a few question and answer scenarios that you might review to help build good rapport with patients and communicate effectively.

# Q: Are you in network with or Do you take my insurance? (NEW PATIENT)

A: I can absolutely help you with that, how did you hear about us?

A: You can certainly use your insurance, our team will make sure we can utilize your benefits to the fullest

Or

A: Although we are not a preferred provider or directly contracted with your insurance company you can absolutely use your insurance in our practice. We are very insurance friendly and handle all claims on your behalf so that you can utilize your benefits to the fullest.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

Have you ever wondered WHY insurance companies want to direct you to the cheapest dentist out there?

# Q: “I’d like to see Dr. Owner Guy…”

(your enthusiasm for the other doctor is key here!)

A: Dr. Owner Guy is booked out the next 9 weeks, (pick a Dr. and use their full name) Dr. Matt has been hand selected from hundreds of dentists by Dr. Owner, let’s get you in with him, in fact, we’re really lucky to have him, my mom just had some really complex dental work done with him and it turned out great, yup she’s thrilled.

# ADDITIONAL - second degree acknowledgement

A: if I was in your shoes I’d be concerned the experience might be different with another provider, I can tell you we have full confidence in our team and Dr. Matt to continue to provide the great experience you’ve become accustomed to at our office

# Acknowledging an upset patient

A: I’m really sorry to hear about (your experience: repeat back patient’s problem), If I was in your shoes I’d be just as upset, you were expecting _______, but the result was not what you expected, what a complete inconvenience.

This is not good enough for us, we’re in the caring business and you left feeling you weren’t cared for.
---
Here’s what I’d like to do for you, let’s go ahead and get you back in with Dr. _____ so we can all get on the same page and get this taken care of for you.

I don’t want to see that doctor, I want to see Dr. Owner

I totally get it, I want to get this addressed right away for you so let’s start here…

If your office happens to have a Dental Savings Plan, you can always use these key points as well:

1. Always compare monthly cost
2. No deductible, strings attached
3. No waiting period
4. We offer a perio option as well
5. Pay monthly or annually
6. No binding contract
7. Membership fees cover hygiene visits

# Cancellation Verbiage

Sometimes a patient will call to cancel their appointment. While this seems like a “final word” situation, it is generally considered a negotiation. Do not slam the door on the appointment, keep the door open! Sometimes they will have an excuse. When they lead with the excuse - skip to #2

1. “Ohhh….can I ask what’s going on?
2. “Are you sure there’s no way you can make it?”
3. Insert patient excuse
4. I understand, “I’d really like to find a way to keep you on the schedule today to help you avoid the last minute appointment change fee”
5. “Yes we require 48 business hours for any appointment changes to avoid the $50 fee”
6. If they absolutely must cancel
7. “Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# First Offense

“Yeah the appointment you had is really prime real estate, but I understand emergencies do happen so I will go ahead and take care of that for you today, but please remember we do appreciate at least 48 business hours notice in the future”

# Second Offense (within 18 months)

“Yeah you had a real prime appointment time, I’m really not supposed to do this, but I’ll go ahead and take care of this a second time”

“To book another appointment a credit card will need to be kept on file in case of another last minute change”

# Third Offense (within 2 years)

charge appointment change fee, inform patient DO NOT rebook

“Ok, we will go ahead and collect that appointment change fee and if there’s ever a day you can come in call us the day of and we will let you know if we can squeeze you in”

# Common FAQs Back to Front Office

This training was developed in order to address training assistants on most common questions from front to back office and empower them to get the solutions without burning out the front office team. As assistants become more proficient some will have created a habit of going to Office manager or treatment coordinator still for common situations that they could solve on their own, this was part of a training we did to empower assistants to become better problem solvers.

# Last minute insurance changes

- Brought a new insurance card in-
- Bring Insurance Card to Ins coordinator (please advise patient this may delay their appointment)
- “I have secondary insurance”-
- Bring Insurance Card to Ins coordinator (please advise patient this may delay their appointment)

# Billing Questions - Day of treatment

- Collections amount different than what patient “remembered” TX coordinator
- Review the following patients charts- Justin B. 11/15/21, Tina C RCT #12.
- Justin B. Why did Justin have a balance of $64.80? He didn’t pay any out of pocket on his previous visit and his wife had a credit of $40. How much does Justin owe us for his 11/15/21 appointment? $270 Where did you gather that information? Treatment plan in OD, Appt Notes, Signed TX Plan
- Tina C.- What was patient’s chief complaint? #12 Where can you find this information? Exam Sheet, Appt Note, TC Note, Dr. Note. How did the patient pay? Payment Plan. Where can you find that information? TC Note, Account Module
- Team members can: pull up a signed TX plan on IPad and walk through it with patient.

# Payment Plans-Tx coordinator

- What kind of payment plans do we offer? Invisalign and Cosmetic Payment Plans. 50% Down and 3-4 Month payments. 50% at Prep and 50% at Deliver for Crowns, NG’s, Bridges.
- What information do we need to gather for TC to enter a payment plan?
- Credit Card, Down Payment Amount, Monthly payments (3 or 4). Preferred Date to have the payment taken out on.

# Questions about deductibles-Ins coordinator

- What is a Deductible? The amount you pay for covered health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay.
---
# Insurance and Treatment Questions

- Can you waive my deductible?
That’s a great question. We cannot, we are required by your insurance company to collect the annual deductible otherwise they will not pay anything toward your treatment today.
- When the estimated amount is more than the original Tx plan - Tx coordinator
This usually occurs when? Insurance is maxed out, the patient went to another provider and used insurance, we didn’t complete previous treatment before treatment planning and insurance estimates were not correct.
- Why the patient has a credit - Ins coordinator
Review the following patients charts:

- Brian L. - Why does the patient have such a large credit? The note from 8/25/21 states the reason.
- Thao W. - Why does the patient have such a large credit? Pop from Financial Coordinator from 10/8/21 provides explanation.
- Patient asks to put half down at prep and half at delivery - Just do it!
- Patient decides to pay with Care Credit
Train Dental Assistants on Care Credit payment process and they can complete on Assistant Computer.
- Clinical Questions - Dentist or assistants
If a patient has clinical questions, before, during or after the procedure please get Dr. first.
- Questions about night guard, ortho, perio coverage - Insurance Module, Ins coordinator
Review the following patients chart:

- Daman R.
- How much Ortho Coverage does Daman have? $2000
- What is the age limit on Ortho Coverage? 99
- What is Daman’s night guard coverage? 60%
- How often can Daman get a night guard covered through his insurance? 1/calendar year.
- When will insurance pay for a nightguard? When there is evidence of Bruxism.
- Scheduling questions “is it ok to schedule someone?”
Use your best judgment when scheduling.

Walk me through the process of scheduling a NG, Invis, Crown Delivery.
- Insurance / EOB / balance questions - Ins coordinator
- Prioritizing next treatment with patients - Dr.
The Doctor should always review NDTR with TC, Assistant or Hygienist in order to guide the patient to next steps.

Review the following patients chart:

- Jessica C
- What was her first phase of treatment? #13, #14 and #15 Where did you find this information? Exam Sheet, Saved treatment plans, hygiene notes.
- What is her next phase of treatment? #3 and #18 found in same as above.
---
# Dental Assistant Recommendations for solving common patient questions

1. Read the notes, pop ups, commlog, Treatment Coordinator notes - look through chart for clues
2. Hygiene could look at insurance breakdown for questions about ortho coverage, perio, night guard if it’s not in the OD notes
3. Go to doctor or senior assistants with clinical questions first
4. Get more prepared in huddle, prepping their own prep sheet and familiarizing yourself with your patient’s history

# Time to seek help

1. Once you’ve exhausted all of your resources...

# Other Bottlenecks

- Post op calls/complications
- Taking a payment

# Pt with Insurance-

- After checking the presented treatment plan, you are ready to collect for the services completed
- Click the “Account” tab above the “Treatment Plan” tab on the left hand side of Open Dental
- The account tab should show the completed services for that date and all other services completed previously
- Click the “New Claim” button (with the yellow umbrella) above the services completed in open dental

130
---
# Taking a Payment in Open Dental

- An “Edit Claim” popup will appear with that days completed service attached
- Click okay on the bottom right hand side of the popup to create the claim to their insurance

131
---
132
---
Continued below

- The estimated patient portion at the bottom of the claim in red should match what was presented in the earlier treatment plan

VS.

- If the balance at the top of the account screen and tx plan dollar amounts don’t match it could mean one of the following:

1. Treatment Discrepancies - Treatment wasn’t completed as presented (services were added or removed prior to completion)
2. - a. Verify accuracy of presented treatment plan and compare with completed services

Outstanding Claims - A claim from previous procedures hasn’t been closed yet (insurance hasn’t paid for earlier services completed) {ie- rct completed 2 weeks before the crown was prepped may still be waiting for payment from insurance} this will reflect in the total balance in the patients account

There are a couple of ways to ensure a more accurate treatment plan.

1. Verrific - There are many different tiers of dental plans within each specific dental insurance. That being said, not every patient that has “Delta Dental” (for example) is going to have the same

133
---
coverage for each procedure. Ideally, the patient- who signed up/is paying for this plan- should know what their plan covers and doesn’t cover. As we know, that is rarely the case. In order to make sure that the estimate that we give to the patient is correct, use the Verrific service to verify coverage. (Instructions Link)

1. The Verrific service takes a couple of days to populate the patient’s explanation of benefits in Open Dental. If scheduling in advance for a patient- make sure to send info to Verrific at least a few days prior to their appointment. That way the patient knows what to expect when they arrive for their treatment.
2. Pre-Authorization- We can also send a pre-authorization (Instructions Link) to guarantee insurance payment for a patient’s specific procedure. These are especially helpful for high dollar treatment plans (implants/bridges/partials/dentures) or plans that might be considered cosmetic (anterior crowns). A pre-authorization can take weeks or even months to get approved depending on the insurance. Usually, send in the pre-auth and wait for it to come back from insurance before scheduling the patient due to fluctuating wait time.
3. Commlogs- Make SURE to read all the recent financial related commlogs just in case there is a note in there about any discounts the doctor may have offered in the treatment room. The assistant will note any price points the doctor may have mentioned (as they don’t always line up with the actual fee’s).

Collect the estimated patient portion after insurance.

- Pts with the Membership:
- - Open dental will populate the discounted services
- Collect the estimated patient portion displayed

Pts without insurance or membership discounts:

# Handoffs

These are the components and examples of a smooth handoff from doctor to team member. Typically at the end of any exam or appointment. We know that when the urgency of the next visit comes from the doctor first, the patient is more likely to adhere to that. This is also written on our route slips or communication sheets. (In Open Dental you can customize the route slips, a great tool for making sure we don’t drop the ball as patients move throughout our practice.)

As a general rule, there are a few key points to a handoff. In order they are:

1. Introduce patient to next team member.
1. “Hey Susie, this is Rebecca, she will help you check out this morning.”
2. Give compliment about team member to the patient.
1. “She has the best smile and will help you check out quickly and get you on your way!”
3. Pass Information along to Team Member.
1. “Rebecca, today we completed XXX treatment and it’s all attached to the appointment.”
2. Pass along any other information according to the NDTR protocol
4. Say thank you to the patient and team member.

Should be very short, simple, and always include the needed information.

This acronym of NDTR came from Dental Consultant Keira Dent (TheDentalATeam.com) and stands for the following:

- N: Next Visit will include the following treatment
- D: Date Range for the next appointment
- T: Time Needed for the next appointment
- R: Is their next hygiene visit re-appointed?

Usually the doctor can mix this into the conversation between the patient, themselves, and their assistant or hygienist. One example is to discuss a crown needed by saying, “So the next thing on your plan is to put a crown on this upper left tooth due to a large cavity. We should really get to this in the next two to three weeks to avoid it getting worse and needing a root canal, and the entire appointment should take about an hour. I’ll let (Hygienist Name) schedule that appointment for you, as well as the next hygiene visit to get the best time that works in your schedule. Any other questions I can answer for you?” The exact NDTR protocol was followed in this interaction, and it not only gives the treatment planner the idea of exactly what is needed, but also gives the patient a clear idea of the next steps in their dental care.

In the handoff, this will get repeated and so the patient has no ambiguity around what is needed, how important it is, and how long the appointment will be.

# Cancellation Protocol for Same Day or Collections Issue

Seems like it happens quite often that a patient shows up to their appointment, but cannot pay the expected patient portion for that appointment. In general, this puts the office in a tight spot. If the office cancels the patient, then it will most likely be an unproductive zero-dollar amount of time. If they do the appointment and the patient cannot pay, the patient might try to not ever pay and then the office is out that money. This is tough, and can be treated differently by each office. However, here is a sample protocol that we use that might be helpful.

- If patient can’t pay co-pay (same Day Cx), then we look at their insurance expected payment
- If over $600 from insurance, still keep appointment
- If less $600 from insurance, cancel appointment
- If patient can’t pay co-pay and we know days in advance, cancel appointment

# Phone Call Tips

Answering the telephone in a dental practice is perhaps the most important element to maximum practice growth and patient retention. All of the marketing efforts, both internal and external, filter through the front desk and the initial phone call. Rapport and relationship building starts at this phone call and its importance cannot be emphasized enough.

# The Basics:

First of all, it is important for the front desk team members to understand that it is not their role to “qualify” or filter the patients that schedule appointments in your office. Time and time again, we’ve seen scheduling coordinators attempting to fill the doctor’s schedule with only “ideal” patients. This is a huge mistake. Since the potential Lifetime Value (LTV) of a dental patient is $45,000, it is imperative that all possible barriers of entry into your office are minimized or removed. Every team member must be aware that the number one goal of the initial phone call is to SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT.

1. Answer within three rings:
There should be one or two primary front office team members who are the most skilled at answering incoming phone calls. However, everyone in the office must be aware of the three ring rule. If the primary schedulers are on the phone or assisting another patient, any other team member must answer the phone within three rings and follow the appropriate script. ALL TEAM MEMBERS must be aware of the correct phone call protocol. If one of the primary schedulers becomes available during the call, it is acceptable to transfer the call to them.
2. Build Rapport:
Regardless of what is happening within the dental office, when the phone rings, the answering team member must present themselves in the friendliest and most helpful manner possible. NEVER make the caller feel as if they are an intrusion to your day. As early as possible in the interaction, get the
---
potential patient’s first name and address them by name for the remainder of the call. Being polite and respectful at all times must be an absolute non-negotiable requirement for anyone answering the phone.

# 3. Categorize (Don’t Qualify) the Caller:

There are six main caller categories and they are listed below in order of priority. Remember that we are not there to qualify whether they are a good fit for our office. Everyone can be a great fit for us, and we are here to make sure they realize how great we are.

# The Three E’s of Phone Calls

When you answer the phone, there are a few key points that we want to review before moving onto what you should actually say. We call this the 3 E’s of Phone Calls and they include:

- Energy
- Empathy
- Edification

# Energy

Energy is the tone of your voice and the style with which you speak to the person on the other end of the line. Energy can be an ambiguous term. Bringing energy on the phone can include increasing the volume of your voice, increasing the inflection points of words to show more of a “sing-song” style, and physically smiling when speaking. Changing your facial muscles to actually smile when talking can be perceived by the person on the other end of the phone. The cheerfulness and energy will likely be matched by the caller, and set a more positive mood for the conversation. It’s ok if you are not a boisterous person generally, but on the phone, it is important to show energy through your voice and smiling.

# Empathy

Empathy is a subtle tactic that helps calm people calling in with a less than ideal dental situation. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of the other person. On the phone, you cannot use body language or physical touch to show empathy, so it needs to come across in a statement. This could include something like, “I’ve had a broken tooth before and I know how traumatic that is.” or “Having some nerves before the appointment is totally normal, we take care of anxious people all the time.” It is important that you are able to connect with the patient on a personal level, especially if your first interaction is a phone call. This empathy is easy to slip into conversation once you start practicing.

# Edification

Edification is how you build up the authority of your office. This could be edifying the doctor, the hygienist, the office, or the team in general. Edification lets the person on the phone know that they picked the correct office, and that they will be well taken care of when they come in. This will be extremely important to win over skeptical or nervous patients. Empathy and edification often go hand in hand. For example, if you have a patient who expresses a fear of the dentist: “We understand anxiety very well, and Dr. Jones is such a calm and gentle doctor that patients just love her.” or “You will be seeing Kaylene as your hygienist, she is the nicest hygienist ever- you will love her!” Some sort of edification statement will help show this new patient that you love the office, and that they should as well.

# Types of Callers:

1. New Patient - These callers are the first priority and should be scheduled as soon as possible. (See script below- #s 1,3)
2. Existing Patient (Scheduling an appointment) - These callers are also of high priority and should be scheduled as soon as possible. Make sure the patient feels as though they are being welcomed back like an old friend. (See script below- #4)
3. Existing Patient (Billing/Insurance question) - These callers are of high priority and must be delivered the highest level of customer service. If at all possible, these callers should be referred to the billing department in order to get the most accurate answers to their questions and to free up the front office team to handle incoming calls. Their name and telephone number should be collected and the call should be returned by the billing specialist within a couple of hours. (See script below- # 7)
4. Vendors - These callers should be referred to an office manager or team member in charge of ordering. Get them off the phone as quickly and courteously as possible and have a team member return their call as soon as convenient. (See script below - #8)
5. Personal Calls - These calls are of low priority. There should be a policy in place that prohibits personal calls during business hours with the exception of emergencies. (See Script below - #9)
6. Sales Calls - These are the lowest priority calls and all should be referred to an office manager or team member. The absolute minimal phone time should be given to these types of calls. (See script below-#10)
7. Miscellaneous Calls - These calls are any calls that don’t fit directly into any of the above categories. Every attempt should be made to delegate returning these calls to another team member when possible.

Greeting:

Thank you for calling Capital Dental this is (Team member’s name) how can I help you smile?

The caller will then respond with a question. Here are the most common questions and appropriate responses:

# 1. Caller: Yes, I see here in the paper that you are having a new patient special for $5 Nitrous. Can you tell me a little more about that?

Team Member Response:

Yes (sir or ma’am) can I get your first name? (Restate their name), our new patient special is $5 and includes Nitrous laughing gas for the duration of any appointment with (Dr.’s name). May I schedule an appointment for you to experience our office?

# 2. Caller: I have XYZ insurance, do you accept it?

Team Member Response:

Can I get your last name? (Restate their name), we accept most dental insurances. However, there are many subtleties to insurances these days and it is very difficult to determine your level of coverage unless we contact your insurance company directly. We’d be happy to complete a complimentary benefits analysis for you when you are here for your new patient exam. (Patient’s name), we have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

(Note: Many consultants advise their clients to do anything to get a caller in the door, even if it means giving misleading information. DO NOT DO THIS! It is not the role of the front desk team to qualify and increase the barriers of entry into the practice; however, if a caller asks a direct question such as, “Do you accept XYZ insurance,” it is always best to give a straightforward and honest answer.)

# 3. Caller: I’d like to make an appointment, please.

Team Member Response: (LOOK AT FLEX PROGRAM- Is there a NAME?) Great! What is your name?

Caller: (Name)

Team Member Response: “Oh Hi (name){Match name with chart shown by Flex Pop-Up}, what day of the week works best for you to see the doctor/hygienist?”

Proceed down decision path to make appointment…

Or if FLEX isn’t matching...then assume a new patient:
---
● Search Pt Name- if no result, click Add Patient under “Add New Family” on the bottom right hand corner of the Select Patient pop-up

● MAKE SURE you are not in the Select Patient pop-up when adding in the new patient info, it will not save anything but the name in that screen

○ Need to be in the “Edit Patient Information” pop-up (will come up after clicking Add Patient button) for info to save

Caller: I’m a new patient.

Team Member Response: Welcome to the practice! Can I get your name?

Caller: Mary

Team Member: Okay Mary, I just need to gather a little more information from you to get you scheduled.

# Critical Information to obtain in initial New Patient phone call:

1. Name (First/Last)
2. Date of Birth
3. Phone Number/Email
4. Insurance Company (if any)
5. Ins Primary Holder/DOB of Primary and Subscriber ID Number.
6. Date of last cleaning/have pt call their previous office to release records and x-rays
7. Doctor Preference

Make sure to get the patient’s email if they have one, and mention that we will be sending the New Patient paperwork to them via email prior to their appointment if they want to save time and fill it out. OTHERWISE- Ask patient to arrive 10-15 mins early for their appointment to fill out health history

Emails are sent at 7:30pm at night, or else go to Flex and send immediately.

Team Member: Mary, are you interested in scheduling a complete exam, or are you experiencing a specific problem that you would like the doctor to take a look at?

Caller: (Option #1: toothache) I’m having a toothache and I want the doctor to let me know what I have to do to get out of pain.

Team Member Response: I’m so sorry to hear that, Mary. We save a couple of spots each day for emergency patients that are in pain. We have an opening today at (give the available times); would you like to come in today?

Caller: (Option #2: Complete Exam) No, I’m just interested in a check-up and cleaning.

Team Member Response: Great! Lets find a time to get you in to meet our wonderful doctors.

# 4. Caller:

Hi, this is Marvin Townson and I need to make an appointment for a crown with (Dr.’s name).

# Team Member’s Response:

Hi Marvin! It’s so great to hear from you! Let’s get you in right away for that procedure. What’s your birthdate and I can pull up your chart? We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# 5. Caller:

How much do you charge for (X)?

# Team Member Response:

(Sir or Ma’am), Are you new to our practice or are you an existing patient?

# Caller:

I’m not currently a patient at your office.

# Team Member Response:

Ok (sir or ma’am), can I get your name?

# Caller:

John.

# Team Member Response:

John, have you recently visited another dentist that told you that you needed (X)?

# Caller:

Yes, and now I’m calling around to see how much other dentist’s charge for (X).

# Team Member’s Response:

John, it is our office’s policy to always give a second opinion exam free of charge. This doesn’t mean just free exam where we charge for an xray, we mean FREE. Since each dentist diagnoses and treatment plans differently, it is difficult to say whether (Dr.’s name) will have the same treatment recommendations. Would you like to come in for a complimentary second opinion exam? We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# 6. Caller:

Hi, I had a horrible dental experience about twenty years ago and I haven’t been back to a dentist since. I’m really embarrassed about the condition of my mouth but I’m deathly afraid of dentists. Is your dentist gentle?

# Team Member’s Response:

(Sir and Ma’am) I’m so glad you called; can I get your first name?

# Caller:

Lisa.

# Team Member’s Response:

First of all Lisa, this is a “no judgment office,” and we understand that a lot of people have had bad dental experiences in the past...so there is absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. (Dr.’s name) is extremely kind and gentle with (his/her) patients- and we even have the ability to do IV sedation in our office in case you are extremely nervous. If you visit our website at (practice’s website address), you’ll see dozens of testimonials of happy patients. We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# The Confirmation Call Script

This call is important because it is the last interaction that the team will have prior to the first in-person visit to the office. Although this conversation should be quick and to the point, it should set the tone for the upcoming visit. The team member must have an upbeat, friendly and helpful demeanor. Remember, we are “inviting” the prospective patient to join the practice.

# LIVE CALL:

Front Desk Team Member: Hello, May I speak with Mr. Williams, please?

Mr. Williams: This is Pete Williams.

Front Desk Team Member: Hello Mr. Williams, this is (Team member’s name) from (Dr.’s name office.) I was calling to confirm your appointment (Date, day and time of appointment.) I also wanted to make sure that you received our welcome packet and new patient paperwork.

Mr. Williams: Yes, I’ll be at the appointment and I’ll bring the paperwork with me. (or “I didn’t receive the paperwork”)

Front Desk Team Member: Great, Mr. Williams. Our whole team is really looking forward to meeting you in person! Again, my name is (Team member’s name) and if you need anything before or during your appointment, please don’t hesitate to ask. See you (day and time)!

Front Desk Team Member: Hello, May I speak with Mr. Williams, please?

Mr. Williams: This is Pete Williams.

Front Desk Team Member: Hello Mr. Williams, this is (Team member’s name) from (Dr.’s name office.) I was calling because Dr. Killeen has had a change in his schedule and I was calling to see if you could help him out by coming in tomorrow at 4:00pm rather than ...(time). If that would work, it would help us out soo much!

# Dental Analogies and Ways of Speaking

Since dentistry is a foreign language to many people, it is good to talk in analogies and stories that are relatable to the normal person. This is a good strategy to help the patient gain understanding quickly about what the problem is and what is needed to fix the problem.

# Tooth Fractures

- Having a fracture in your tooth is like driving with a bald tire waiting for a blowout.
- Bulging tire analogy. Everyone knows a bald tire is on a continuum and about to blow. Bulging tires sneak up on you and seemingly have no rhyme or reason.
- "Can't we just put a filling in there again?" Not really. A filling is just what it says it is. You have a cavity, so you remove the decay and now you have a hole. So you fill it with something so you don't get stuff stuck in there. But a filling never strengthens the tooth. The tooth supports the filling. Once you have more filling than tooth, the tooth can no longer support the filling, so we start to see cracks and chips. This typically happens when the filling material is about half of the biting surface of the tooth. (show pt tooth in mirror or I/O pic) Your tooth is well past this point. See these cracks? You're kinda on borrowed time already. Let's fix this before it breaks and we can't restore it.
- A filling will seal the crack temporarily but it’s like using a bandaid to repair a leaking dam....something's gotta give, it's just a matter of time.....really depends on your risk tolerance (again most patients opt to crown).
- A crack in your tooth is no different than a crack in your windshield....it starts off small and eventually spreads until you ultimately have to replace the windshield.....(anchor to tooth loss offer crown).
- Filling vs crown.....”we can fill your tooth....it’ll be cheaper and quicker but it’s temporary and the tooth can still break (goal is to get a no because it’s not the superior treatment option)....or we can crown the tooth: the crown is more expensive (address the elephant in the room) but it will prevent your tooth from breaking in half or causing you pain. (This method on paper may sound like it sucks but it works well because it addresses the higher cost and elicits the negative emotion associated with pain/infection).
- Fillings and crowns are like tires for your car, you only get so much use out of them before you need to replace them.
- I/O shows crack. Why can't you just do a filling? It’s like putting super glue on a cracked windshield...I don’t know when it's gonna give, but it will give. Hopefully, we can still do a crown on that day and not something more expensive. Should we fix it with a crown today?
- “John do you see this crack right here (IO photo/problem)....cracks can spread into the nerve and cause pain or infection....if they spread below the gums the tooth needs to come out (consequence)....so we place a cap/crown on the tooth to hold it together (solution)” (stop talking: let the patient ask questions, let the left brain analytical go to town while the others typically accept treatment).
- Everyone’s practice philosophy varies. I don't wanna step on any toes here, I have found amalgam removal to be a controversial topic....but we remove almost all amalgam fills.....the majority have cracks in the teeth.

# Hygiene

The gum therapy can remove the plaque clinging to your teeth like barnacles on a ship, but that plaque was also touching your gums. Instead of cutting away your gums with a sharp surgical blade, we use a laser light to zap just those diseased areas to increase healthy gum formation and decrease sensitivity. -- It's like using a knife to get the peanut butter out of a jar, you can really get a lot, but we all know there's some sticking to the sides that will never come out. That's what the laser does for us.

I like that I use a similar saying for cleanings. I let them know your cleaning is like your oil change. I can give you a Bentley but it’s not going to last 200k miles if you beat it up and don’t get your scheduled maintenance.

I also use “barnacles on a boat” to describe calculus. You can’t just pull a barnacle off a boat, you have to use an instrument to physically scrape it off. It’s the same for the hardened bacteria under your gums... a regular cleaning won’t take it off but the hygienists can remove it with special instruments.

I always relate periodontal health to the foundation of a house. “We need to make sure the ‘foundation’ is healthy and strong before concentrating on the teeth that use the bone for support.”

# Bruxism

Tooth is like a pumpkin: hard outer layer, softer inner and then the goop in the middle..the hard outer layer is enamel, the softer inner we call dentin and the goop in the middle is the nerve....you have worn your teeth down to the softer second layer.....getting closer to the nerve (show them in a mirror, use IO photos, and have them bring the teeth together to line up the wear facets while looking in a mirror. This is powerful): this can be used to discuss night guards, ortho (functional aspect), and potentially crowns if the clinical situation calls for it.

Tooth is like an M&M and they've worn past the CandyShell and now they're into the soft chocolate.

# Immediate dentures

I am making your new plate to fit your current jaw and I’ll have to make some guesses. Say your jaw is like your feet. The day I extract the teeth, if your jaw is a size 11.5, the denture has to be at least a 12 for me to fit it in. After a few months, it will be a 10 or maybe an 8. Then we can reline it which is like putting more socks on, or remake it to fit better.

Immediate denture is like putting from 100 feet. We will get it closer, but no way we aren't going to need to putt again.
---
For females, I say dentures are like a wedding dress and multiple fittings before the big day, as your gums heal and change so will the fit of your dentures. You’ll need a couple of fittings over time until it’s just right.

# Root canals

I use this when patients ask why a crown is necessary after a root canal - Ever touch a tree that lost its water supply? The bark just comes off and crumbles. That’s the same as a root canal treated tooth. You not only remove the nerve but also the blood vessels. And just like the tree the tooth will crumble so let’s put that protective cover on the tooth.

A root canal treated tooth is like a tree stump that’s been hit by lightning.....it’s dead, dry and brittle....It’s roots are still there and anchored but it’s fragile.....(pcss and recc crown)

# Ortho

When patient only wants to do one arch: That’s like only changing one shoe at a time, you won’t walk properly and over time, you may never walk properly again without surgery.

Occlusal issues and force distribution problems: Like the front end of your car being out of alignment. Minor situations, your tires wear early, moderate, your wearing bearings and struts, severe, your steering wheel is shaking while you drive down the road. Support conversation with IO of abfraction enamel crazing wear facets and radiographs of joint wear.

IPR - we gently smooth the rough sides of some of the teeth to create spaces as thick as a contact lens so all your teeth can line up like soldiers.

# Sleep Apnea

Cpap is using air to blow and keep the tube open. An oral device is like a car jack to keep your tongue from closing the hole.

# Onlays

It’s like a perfectly fitting puzzle piece made of tooth colored material that replaces the broken part of your tooth. And it lasts longer than fillings made of plastic.

# Treatment planning

The way I see it is you’re driving and I'm navigating. We'll go as quickly or as slowly as you want to go, and I'll keep you away from any major pitfalls. We can get right to where we want to go or take the scenic route. It doesn't matter to me.

I always say that teeth are like a 30 year roof...at some point you will probably have a couple of leaks.

# Crowns

(always use an intraoral photo of the patients tooth that is recommended for a crown)

“You see this tooth here Mrs. Jones, I want you to know I am concerned about this tooth and I am concerned because with the size of this filling here the tooth is very susceptible to fracturing and I don’t want you to have a dental emergency where the tooth breaks and we have to do a root canal or even worse if it breaks so bad we have to extract it.”
---
● Wait and listen “so what do we need to do ?”

● “Mrs. Jones, I would recommend that we put a crown or a cap on this tooth to protect it from breaking. You see a crown will cover the tooth 360 degrees, a crown is the artificial replacement of the enamel outer surface of your tooth and it looks and feels just like your tooth but it will strengthen it”

# Root Canal, Build Up, Crown

● “When you have pain from a tooth it is either because there is a cavity in the nerve, an infection from the tooth or gums or a cracked tooth. A root canal is done to get you out of pain and help you keep the tooth. In each tooth there are main nerves like the trunks of a tree and then a bunch of tiny branches that extend from them. We clean out and fill the nerve so that

# Fillings

● “Sensitivity following tooth colored fillings is completely normal. Many times teeth are not sensitive at all, but it is very common for one tooth or a few teeth to be sensitive to chewing and hot and cold for a few weeks up to several months, it WILL get better with time.”

● “If your bite feels off we would like to see you to adjust your bite, if the bite is ok just know it will get better with time”

# Implant vs. Bridge

● https://blueskybio.com/pages/bio-view-patient-treatment-videos

# Oral Sedation

● (When sedation is required we use oral sedation 99% of the time. Oral Sedation works great for wisdom teeth extractions, implants, root canals, anxiety. If a patient insists on IV sedation that is perfectly fine we can bring a dental or nurse anesthesiologist in for $600 for the first 90 minutes then $50 for every 15 minutes after that. Our primary contact for IV sedation is Royce Fishell he can be reached at 303-921-3181 option to is Shaheen Moezi 702-682-6799.)

● “Most of our patients with anxiety or patients that need a longer procedure done find oral sedation to really work well. With oral sedation you’ll have a family member drive you here and take you home, we will give you all of the instructions but we ask you to fast for 8 hours then we have you get here an hour early we get you nice and comfy, all set up with a movie on netflix and give you some medicine that you take by mouth. Once it kicks in you don’t care that we are doing dental work on you and most people don’t even remember the procedure. Oral sedation is very safe because you are still conscious. You aren’t necessarily asleep but you are so relaxed that you will doze in and out.”

# Night Guards: Bruxism / Recession / Abfractions / Sensitivity

● “Many people grind their teeth, in fact a lot of us here at the office wear night guards for that reason. In your case you are showing signs of clenching and grinding, a night guard will act like a shock absorber so you aren’t putting so much force on your teeth and jaw joints. Clenching and grinding leads to recession and sensitivity and even chipping of your teeth at the gumline. Some people grind during the day while driving, working out or working on the computer, but most people also clench and grind in their sleep and aren’t even aware of it.”
---
# Hygiene Explanations

# Gingivitis:

Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. I am getting some measurements that are reading 4mm. This means the tissue is red, inflamed and swollen. Bleeding is also a sign of bacteria under the gum line that we need to clean out. There could be certain points in your cleaning that it is a little bit uncomfortable, but we would like to get the inflammation down and the bleeding to lessen. If we don’t then we might need to do a deep cleaning.

# Periodontal Disease:

Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. 4mm pockets are considered gingivitis and 5mm and above are considered periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is bacteria underneath the gum line that causes bleeding and bone loss. We can try to prevent the pockets and bone loss from getting worse. The bone unfortunately will not grow back, but the pockets and tissue health can improve.

Periodontal disease is sort of like having a bleeding-infection the size of your fist, but in your mouth around all your teeth. If you had that on your arm, you’d run to the doctors office right away, but since you can’t see it in one spot, sometimes it’s easy to say, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

# SRP:

A deep cleaning consists of getting numb to perform a thorough cleaning. We go under the gum line to the bottom of the pocket and clean out the bacteria and build up. We are hoping for less inflammation, bleeding and reattachment of the pockets.

Once we are finished with the deep cleaning we like to have you come back for maintenance cleanings more regularly to see how the pockets are healing and monitor the bone loss.

# Arestin:

Arestin is a localized antibiotic that is placed into a deeper pocket to help get rid of the bacteria and help heal the pocket back to a healthy measurement. It is a powder that adheres to the tissue and it stays down in the pocket for 28 days, you can floss and waterpik like normal but do not be too vigorous in that area.

# Cavitron:

This is a tool that looks like all of my other instruments but it uses vibration and water to help me clean your teeth. It is great because it flushes out some of the bacteria underneath the gum line and vibrates the build up off. It uses less pressure than traditional instruments so most patients like it better. If there is sensitivity please let me know.
---
# Whitening Trays:

We make whitening trays here in the office. We do impressions of your mouth and make trays that are custom to your teeth. Once we take the impressions you can come back and pick up your trays the following day if the office is open. For optimal whitening you can whiten everyday or every other day for a week or two until desired whiteness. Then you can keep the trays for touch ups down the road. You just need to put a dot of whitening gel in each tooth that you can see in your smile and leave the trays in for about an hour. It is normal to have some sensitivity after whitening.

# Recession/ Abfractions:

Areas of recession are located where the gum line and teeth meet. These areas are exposing the root surface of the tooth. The root surface is not as strong as the enamel which is the part of the tooth that we see and can be very sensitive. These areas are mainly caused by clenching and grinding. It is like a fence post, if the soil is here and you keep moving the board back and forth the soil around the bottom will start to move away and make the board loose and not stable in the ground. It is the same with our teeth. If we keep “knocking”, so clenching and grinding, our gums and bone will start to recede.

(To help this problem I would recommend a night guard and fluoride. The night guard will help the wear on your teeth and the fluoride will help the areas of exposed root surface from getting decay and will also lessen sensitivity.)

# Fluoride

“We recommend fluoride to all of our patients because it has so many benefits for keeping your teeth strong and healthy. Fluoride helps prevent any new cavities and protect your current fillings and crowns, it also helps with any sensitivity especially in areas of recession. The areas of recession are also more prone to decay because it is not as strong as the enamel. It looks like it’s only 25 for today if you want to take advantage of the fluoride treatment.”

It is a good idea to train on all these and all have the same verbiage around how to speak to patients. One of the big keys for patients to accept our treatment is to make sure they have a clear understanding of what is needed. Making sure you speak the same way about the same procedures will help them understand the treatment needs - and thus accept treatment more often.

# Communication Principles Checklist

We understand the importance of developing rapport and have memorized the top key points of rapport-building.

We have systemized the FORM communication method.

We understand that certain words are “off-limits”, and use the “this not that” format for correct verbiage.

We have trained on cancellation verbiage and role played how to avoid cancellations.

We have trained on the most frequently back-to-front questions, and understand how to take payments to avoid issues.

We have a system for handoffs, and have role-played smooth handoffs.

We know and use the NDTR method for clear communication.

We have learned and execute the 3 E’s of phone calls.

We have categorized callers and know how to handle each type of caller to the practice.

We have a list of dental analogies and way of speaking so that patients can understand treatment better.

Now that we have a clear way to talk to our patients and between team members, we will dig into the clinical items that will make the practice flow smoothly.

# Chapter 6

# Clinical Daily Items

Of course it’s interesting to learn about communication and all the soft skills in the dental office, but generally we do dentistry because we love the clinical aspects as much as patient interaction. In order for the clinical side of appointments to flow well, we need to be very prepared and ready for every way the appointment might go. In general, this includes making sure we are ready with:

- Systemized Tray Setups
- Similar Bur Blocks
- Sterilization clean and ready for flow
- Organized drawer setups
- Standardized restorative and surgical bins
- Standardized Implant setups

Standardized tray setups are essential to running an efficient dental practice. There are many ways to organize this and you will have your own preferences. When we add an associate or new doctor, we want to plug them into a system that works. It is in the associate’s best interest to follow the systems and setups that you and the team have in place. At our practice, we refer out very few procedures so we have one restorative setup that allows us to do anything from a filling to an endo and then we have carts that we roll in for the specialty equipment. We also have a basic setup for post op appointments, limited exams, crown deliveries etc and hygiene has 2 setups: Prophy and SRP. We have found if we have separate instrument setups for fillings, crowns, endo, etc it gets very cumbersome and makes it harder to onboard assistants or pivot when treatment pivots.

Bur block setups are also standardized for almost every procedure. Similar to the tray setup, it is key to have one bur setup that is the same for all procedures and all doctors. Keep it simple, not only does this help with efficiency, but it also helps with inventory and overhead control.

Proper sterilization flow is not only important for infection control purposes, but also for efficiency. There are sterilization standards that we must follow and have a system for. We assign one person to sterilization making sure we do spore tests (weekly), foil tests (monthly) etc. One thing that has helped us tremendously and has allowed for temps or front office team members to easily help is having

# Set up and flow of Sterilization

It is also very important that each drawer in each area of the practice is clean and organized. This is one of the drawers in sterilization.

# Restorative Setups

The next few pages will show exactly how each tray should be set up for each specific procedure. You can copy how we do things here in this manual, or you can make your own and have it in either a digital format (Powerpoint or Google Document), or laminated in the practice hanging in each room to help people learn the best setup.

# Invisalign and Cosmetic Treatment

As you start doing more Invisalign and cosmetic treatments, you might be taking more 3-Dimensional scans as well as treatment planning more cases for these larger treatments. When this treatment planning occurs, there are a few things you can do to help track your case acceptance.

One would be to create ‘fake’ codes in Open Dental to put in when a patient is:

1. Scanned
2. Treatment planned Invisalign but have low interest in moving forward
3. Treatment planned Invisalign and have high interest in moving forward

See the items below that can help you in systemizing your Invisalign and Cosmetic treatment planning.

# Existing Patient in the practice:

1. When you Scan, Enter the ‘SCAN’ Code
2. If they want to start treatment ASAP- schedule them back with Dr. for 40 minute consult
3. If they don’t start treatment, enter either Invis1 (Low Interest) or Invis2 (High Interest).

# If they’re a New Patient:

1 hour visit, $0 consult fee

Goal is for patients to TOUCH THE ITERO SCREEN!

# Oral Conscious Sedation Appointment Protocol

# Educational Material and Consent Form

The facts in this form will help you learn more about the type of anesthesia your doctor has recommended for your procedure. Please read it carefully. You will be asked to sign the last page of this form. Please watch the video on our website here: https://www.mycapitaldental.com/about/patient-resources/sedation-dentistry

# Your Health Problem

Your doctor has recommended that you have conscious sedation for pain control during your procedure. It will make you sleepy yet comfortable enough so the procedure can be performed.

- There are many types of anesthesia.
- Local anesthesia is like the numbing medicine the dentist may use.
- Minimal sedation involves different types of medicine to make you sleepy.
- Conscious sedation places you into a deeper state of sedation but you are able to talk and move.
- General anesthesia makes you unconscious and a machine breathes for you. During general anesthesia, you are not aware of your surroundings and are not able to respond.

# The Procedure and Follow Up

Your dental assistant will ask you about any allergies before the procedure. First, an IV line will be started. An IV line is a plastic tube that is placed into a vein (usually in the hand or arm) so that you can get medicines and fluids during the procedure. Small pads called electrodes may be placed on your chest to monitor your heart.

A plastic strip will be placed on one of your fingers and joined to a pulse oximetry machine. This machine will track your oxygen levels. A blood pressure cuff will be put on your arm to check your blood pressure and other vital signs during the procedure.

The amount of medication is customized for each patient. Your doctor will decide how much is right for you. Your doctor or assistant will give you the medicine (called sedatives and analgesics) in your IV and start with a small amount. It will make you very sleepy but you will
---
still be able to respond with your voice, by touch, or by movement. You will be able to breathe on your own while you have conscious sedation.

# Risks and Common Problems

There are risks linked to conscious sedation, which include but are not limited to:

- Airway obstruction: you could get an airway obstruction if something (possibly your tongue) blocks or covers your airway. This would make it hard to breathe.
- Apnea: You could stop breathing.
- Bronchospasm: You could feel a sudden tightening around the airway muscles, making it hard to breathe.
- Cardiac Arrest: You could have a heart attack.
- Death.
- Drug reaction.
- IV site: You could have pain, bruising or some clotting on the surface where the IV was placed.
- Oxygen desaturation: Your oxygen levels could fall below normal and you would have to be given more oxygen.
- Stridor: You could get a constriction or narrowing of the airway passages that makes it hard to breathe.
- Throwing up.

*If any of the problems listed above happen to you, you may need to have more treatment.

# Other Choices

If you do not wish to have conscious sedation for this procedure, you may choose another type of anesthesia. You may also choose not to have the procedure. Your doctor will explain any other options to you.

How well suited you are for any other form of treatment will depend on your specific health history.

# More Facts

You will have an assistant by your side during the procedure and afterwards during your recovery. The staff working with you will have emergency medicines and equipment available. They will also have an emergency plan should something happen during your procedure.

# Consent to Treatment

I authorize the clinical staff to make the decision to not complete all intended treatment due to complications that may arise during my sedation appointment. These complications may include but are not limited to:

- abnormal vital signs
- adverse reactions to the medications used for sedation
- adverse reactions to medications and sedation due to any recreational drugs I may take*
---
# Recreational Drug Use

I will inform the doctors/staff at Capital Dental of any recreational drugs that I may take that will possibly cause unsafe and dangerous complications with surgery. This includes marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, or hallucinogenic agents.

- You will be scheduled to arrive 1 hour prior to starting treatment for the administration of the sedation medication
---
It is absolutely essential that you have your escort drive you to your appointment. We will not be able to proceed with your appointment if you drive yourself, and this will result in forfeiting your pre-paid fee for the appointment. The person driving the patient must be able to stay with the patient until sedation wears off. (possibly 2-4 hours after arriving home)

Regrettably, failure to comply with the items marked with an asterisk can compromise the safety of the sedation procedure. In most cases, the dentist will not be able to proceed with your treatment.

# Following Appointment

- No driving for 24 hours after appointment
- No operating hazardous devices
- No heavy lifting
- No Stairs

# Escort Information

Today you will supervise the recovery of a sedated patient. The effects of sedation can alter judgment, memory, walking and/or balance for up to several hours after the appointment - Sometimes More.

Please be prepared to directly protect the patient from falling or incurring other types of injury. It is easy to become distracted after a period of time, and the patient may attempt getting up to walk without assistance, which could result in the patient falling and incurring an injury.

The patient should not drive any type of vehicle or operate machinery until the next day and only if they feel fully recovered.

Please be sure the patient takes the prescribed medications as directed. It is easy for a sedated patient to get confused and not take their medications as directed (I.E. taking too many medications, the wrong medications, taking at wrong intervals, etc.). In addition, before a patient takes any medication after their appointment, the patient should have eaten something beforehand.

If you have any concerns or questions please immediately call our office at (720) 870-9500 and 911 if urgent.

Thank you for your concern and commitment to the safety of our patient.

I _____________________________ have received and understand the written post sedation and post operative instructions provided to me.

# Nitrous

Nitrous oxide is plumbed into every operatory. Each morning one nitrous tank (blue) and one oxygen tank (green) will need to be turned on. Open to the left - the dials on the top of the tanks will read how full each tank is. The tanks will need to be closed each night (turn to the right).

# How to turn on/administer nitrous: (Doctors and Hygienist are able to start a patient on nitrous)

- Connect a nitrous hood to the exhalation valve hub and tubing
- Nitrous hoods located in baskets above the dirty side of sterilization
- Sizes small, medium, large
- Use one of the two high vacuum suctions to attach to the vacuum source connected to the back counter
- Press the power button to turn on unit
- Use the up and down arrows on the unit to adjust how much oxygen and nitrous the pt will intake (usually start 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous and gauge how the patient is reacting)
- Place the nitrous hood over the patient’s nose
- Instruct the patient to take deep breaths in and out through their nose
- Nitrous will take about 5 mins to take effect
- After the patient is feeling the effects of the nitrous you can turn up or down according to the patient’s preference
- Someone must be in the room at all times monitoring a patient on nitrous
- Once the procedure is complete, turn the oxygen up to 100% for 5 mins to flush the nitrous out of the patient’s system
- The patient can be dismissed after the pure oxygen is administered and they are feeling back to “normal”

# Clinical Items Checklist

We are systemized with trays, bur blocks, and setups for each type of appointment.

We have pictures of sterilization and drawer setups for uniformity.

We have pictures and lists of each setup for each type of procedure.

We have uniform bins for restorative, endodontics and each speciality procedure in the office.

We have protocols for tracking lab cases.

We have a system for tracking and following up with patients who are interested in high-dollar procedures.

We have systems that review pre-op procedures for more complex procedures.

We have systems that help improve clinical notes for complex procedures like Botox, Sedation, PRF, and Nerve Damage.

This chapter has included many of the things that will make you successful in the operatory, from ideal setups to more clinical “how-to” documents. Any dental assistant in the practice should try to become proficient in these items as they will help make the practice flow much better and there will be uniformity within the practice between assistants.

# Chapter 7

# Post Operative Instructions

A key to a fantastic patient experience is to have a full understanding of the procedures and the after-effects of those procedures. As the patient ends their treatment, it is a good idea to have a clear understanding of the rest of the process- including post-operative directions and things to expect. These are our written post op instructions. As a dental assistant, it is extremely important and necessary to memorize a version of these. In addition to telling these patients all these instructions, you may also choose to call any patient that receives anesthetic the following day. This is a great touch, a practice builder and allows you to head off post-operative questions.

# Sedation Post Op Instructions (minimal Oral Conscious Sedation)

# POST-SEDATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Do not drive a motor vehicle for 24 hours after sedation.
2. Do not operate any hazardous devices/machinery for 24 hours after sedation.
3. A responsible adult person should be present until you have fully recovered from the effects of the sedation.
4. You should not go up and down stairs unattended. Whenever possible, stay on the first floor until recovered.
5. You should resume normal eating and drinking after the sedation appointment, unless otherwise instructed by the dentist.
6. Drink plenty of water post-operatively to prevent dehydration and to prevent the “hangover” of sedation medications.
7. After leaving the dental office, you should not be left unattended. You might feel normal and recovered, but the effects of the medication can last for several hours after the appointment has ended. Do not make important decisions for the remainder of the day following your sedation appointment.
8. Always hold someone’s arm when walking as you may have problems with balance while under the effects of the sedative medications.
9. Call the office if you have any questions or concerns. If you feel that your symptoms warrant a physician and you are unable to reach us, go to the nearest emergency room immediately.

# Extraction Post Operative Instructions

Following most surgical procedures there may or may not be pain. You will be provided with medication for discomfort that is appropriate for you. In most cases, a non-narcotic pain regimen is recommended consisting of acetaminophen (Tylenol ® ) and ibuprofen (Advil ® ). These two medications taken together can be as effective as a narcotic without any of the side effects. If a narcotic has been prescribed, follow the directions carefully. If you have any questions about these medications interacting with other medications you are presently taking, please call our office (555-555-5555), your physician and/or your pharmacist.

# Proper care of the mouth following most dental procedures can reduce complications and speed the healing of the surgical area.

- Protection of the blood clot: Maintain gentle pressure by biting on the gauze sponge that has been placed over the surgical area. Keep steady firm pressure for 45 minutes. Repeat as often as needed. Be sure to moisten the gauze with a little water so that it won't stick to the clot.
- Do not rinse: or use a mouthwash for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, rinse with warm salt water (1/2 teaspoon table salt in 8 oz. of warm water) every 1-2 hours is recommended. The use of commercial mouthwashes during the healing period is NOT advised due to the alcohol content.
- Discomfort: Following dental surgery it is normal to experience some discomfort. If medication has been given or prescribed, take as instructed.
- The toothbrush: may be carefully used in the area of the mouth not involved by the surgical procedures. A clean mouth heals faster.
- Eating: Adequate food and fluid intake following surgery is most important. If you find that eating your regular diet is too difficult, you may supplement your diet with liquids such as Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB / any flavor). The high quality, nutritional value of CIB is important for prompt healing following such procedures. Should you not be able to chew solid foods of any nature, for several days or longer, contact our office.
- Avoid: all excessive activity. Don't pick at the surgical area. Don't consume liquids through a straw. Avoid alcoholic beverages and refrain from smoking until healing is well established.
- Sutures: If they were used, do not fail to return for their removal on the appointment date given.
- Control swelling: Gently apply ice packs to the area for periods of 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off. This procedure should continue for the first 24 hours only.
- Medications: Make sure you take your prescribed medications strictly following instructions. Women taking birth control medications should be aware that antibiotics can cause the birth control medications to be ineffective possibly resulting in pregnancy. Alternate methods should be used while on the antibiotics.

# NON-NARCOTIC PAIN REGIMEN IS RECOMMENDED

CONSISTING OF ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL®) AND IBUPROFEN (ADVIL®). THESE TWO MEDICATIONS TAKEN TOGETHER, CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS A NARCOTIC WITHOUT ANY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS. IF A NARCOTIC HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE MEDICATIONS INTERACTING WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS YOU ARE PRESENTLY TAKING, PLEASE CALL OUR OFFICE, YOUR PHYSICIAN AND/OR YOUR PHARMACIST.

- IF a bone graft was placed...do not be alarmed if small pieces of the bone graft material become dislodged, be careful not to disrupt the bone graft or soft tissue membrane covering the extraction site. Make sure to attend your post operative visit for the doctor to evaluate the grafted site.
- Allergic reactions... for generalized rash, itching, or other reactions, call our office immediately. If we are not available at the time, go to the nearest hospital emergency room.
- Do not hesitate... to call if any questions arise.

# ADDITIONAL POST OPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF IMPACTED WISDOM TEETH

1. Following the removal of sutures, your usual oral hygiene routine may be resumed. However, the areas immediately adjacent to the 3rd molar (wisdom tooth) socket may be tender and therefore, should be brushed carefully. Gentle brushing will not injure the healing tissue.
2. Special care must be given to the healing areas of the lower impacted wisdom teeth. The use of a plastic syringe, as demonstrated by the nurse, is suggested as an aid to keeping this area clean. A Water Pik, with minimal pressure, may be used in place of the syringe. A diluted solution of any popular brand mouthwash may be used or warm salt water (1 teaspoon salt to an 8 ounce glass of warm water) may be used as a substitute. This routine, in conjunction with regular brushing of the teeth, should be performed each time immediately after food consumption.
3. The use of the syringe for the lower sockets must be maintained for at least 3 weeks. Improper oral hygiene in this area may result in complications and a postoperative infection, which can occur many weeks following the initial surgical procedure.
4. In the event of any complication, especially pain or swelling, or if there is any question regarding your postoperative progress, please telephone this office immediately.

Thank you for your cooperation.

# Post Op Instructions in Case of Sinus Communication

# MAXILLARY SINUS INSTRUCTIONS

You are given this information sheet because your surgery today involved entry into the sinus under your cheekbone. This was due to either:

- The roots of your upper back teeth extended into the sinus, and a temporary communication from the sinus into the mouth was created following the extraction in this region, or
- The surgical procedure performed today involved treating a problem within your sinus(es).

When you eat or drink following surgery near the sinus, liquid may pass into the sinus and may be
---
discharged from the nose. This discharge may appear bloody. Do not become alarmed, this is normal.

# TO SPEED HEALING AND PREVENT COMPLICATIONS, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS LISTED BELOW:

1. Do not create suction by smoking, sucking on straws, etc.
2. Try to suppress sneezing. To prevent pressure buildup if sneezing occurs, keep the mouth open.
3. Do not forcefully blow your nose to “clear” the sinus or nasal passages.
4. Return for suture removal and post-operative appointments as advised by the doctor.
5. You should purchase and use the following medications.
6. Avoid Swimming and any strenuous activity for a week
7. Do not play any wind instruments for a week

SUDAFED 30 mg tablets: Take 2 tablets every 6 hours for _____ days.

AFRIN or NEO-SYNEPHRINE nasal spray: Use as per package instructions for no more than three (3) days.

Antibiotics: __________________________. Take as directed on prescription.

# Teeth Whitening

- Follow instructions included in your kit.
- Total treatment time is usually 10-14 days. Some cases may take longer, especially if treatment is interrupted.
- Make sure you brush and floss thoroughly prior to each treatment. The bleaching gel can work better if it is in contact with the tooth rather than plaque buildup.
- Mild sensitivity to cold liquids or air may occur. This usually passes a few days after treatment is completed. If the sensitivity is severe or persists, discontinue using the gel and contact our office.
- If you experience any gum irritation, let us know. Your custom tray may need to be adjusted.
- Whitening works best on yellow stained teeth. Gray teeth are more difficult to whiten, or may not respond to treatment. Such cases may require porcelain veneers to achieve the desired result.
- Results can be quite dramatic. However upon completion of the whitening process, the color will “tone down” somewhat. This is normal and actually looks more natural.
- Long term results vary from patient to patient. This can depend on many factors including habits such as smoking or coffee, tea, wine, or cola consumption.
- “Touch-up” treatments may be needed every 3 – 6 months. This can usually be accomplished in 1 or 2 treatments of 1 – 2 hours each. A special touch-up kit is available at our office.
- Existing fillings, crowns, bonding, etc. will not whiten. Therefore, these restorations may need to be changed in order to match your new smile.
- It is important to keep your 2-week follow-up appointment so we can assess the results or make changes in treatment as needed.
- If you have unsightly old silver fillings ask us about changing them to invisible white fillings. Old crowns with dark gum lines can be changed to more natural looking metal-free porcelain crowns.
- If your friends wonder why you are smiling so much, tell them about us. It would be our pleasure to help them improve their smiles, too!

# PREVIDENT 5000 FLUORIDE GEL

If you are receiving these instructions that means you have been prescribed a topical fluoride toothpaste to aid in keeping your teeth healthy. In certain cases you may be receiving custom trays to aid in the application of the gel directly to the teeth.

# Indications:

Dry mouth, root surface caries, high caries risk children and adults.

# Instructions:

Before bed, following normal brushing, flossing and rinsing, apply a pea size amount of Prevident gel to toothbrush and brush onto all surfaces of all teeth, then spit out, do not rinse!
---
# PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SCALING AND ROOT PLANING

These are some helpful suggestions that will increase your comfort and help you to receive the maximum benefit from periodontal treatment.

1. Tenderness is normal. To reduce tenderness and promote healing, every two to three hours, rinse with warm salt water: ½ teaspoon salt in a 4 ounce glass of water.
2. Avoid brushing or flossing the treated area for 12 hours. However, after 12 hours it is very important that you continue to brush well. Please be careful brushing and use a toothbrush with soft bristles. You may moisten the brush with warm water if tissues are tender.
3. Tylenol or Ibuprofen may be used as recommended for discomfort.
4. Highly nutritious food is necessary for the healing process. Avoid foods that require excessive chewing, also, sticky, crunchy or coarse foods.
5. Tooth sensitivity is normal and temporary. You may use a desensitizing toothpaste such as Sensodyne or any major brand for sensitivity relief.
6. You may also gently massage the areas treated with your washed fingers. This will increase circulation and promote healing.

Lastly, please contact our office (555-555-5555) should you experience prolonged bleeding or any other problems during the healing process.

These suggestions will help you receive the greatest benefit from today’s treatment.

# Trial Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Eat carefully with your Trial Smile or temporary veneers; they are not as strong as the permanents (this is designed intentionally to be able to remove them for the permanents).
2. Discomfort is normal for a day or two. These discomforts include tenderness under your lip at the site of injection and around the gum line where excess cement was removed. Some mild, hot and cold sensitivity is a rare but temporary side effect. For discomfort, take three ibuprofen four times a day for three days.
3. Your Trial Smile is one piece, so you will not be able to floss. Don't worry, your New Smile will be individual like your natural teeth. In the meantime, brush 2 times a day with a focus on gently brushing at the gum line.
4. Your homework is to notice things that need improvement on the trial smile such as imperfections with the bite, length, color, and other aesthetic desires. Your next appointment is 1-3 days after the trial smile. Please take the time to get used to your different smile and note what you like and don't like. At this easy, 40-minute appointment (no numbing), Your Smile Design team will make adjustments to the trial smile until it's exactly to your liking. Only when that happens, will we take photos and impressions for our in-house ceramist to use as the blueprint for the permanent restorations. This is how we can guarantee you'll love the permanent restorations. Plastic surgeons wish they had an opportunity to try on a nose before the final. We have such an opportunity and take it very seriously.
---
# Final Smile Post-Op Directions

1. Now that your permanent veneers are bonded to your teeth, you can use them just as you would natural teeth. Which means eat anything you'd like but don't ever use veneers or natural teeth as tools (i.e., nail biting, tearing packages or string, etc.).
2. Floss at least daily and brush twice per day. Your gums might be tender for 24-48 hours but please continue brushing and flossing through the minor discomfort. It will help the gums heal faster. If small bits of material come out, don't be alarmed. This is excess cement that loosens over the next few days and is completely normal. For discomfort, take three ibuprofen four times a day for three days.
3. Your Perfect Bite appointment will be in a few days. Much like the previous appointment, it's a quick, no-numbing appointment to fine-tune the bite, clean up cement left over, and very minor adjustments to the aesthetics.

# Veneer Maintenance

1. If by any chance, anything ever happens to one of your veneers, contact us immediately. We're proud of our 99.3% (national average of 90%) success rate with veneers, but on the very rare occasion one can break or debond.
2. A custom night guard is recommended to protect your new smile from nighttime teeth grinding that most people do without even knowing it.
3. Maintain a normal schedule of cleanings as directed to keep up your gums healthy and increase the health and longevity of all of your teeth.
4. Smile as much as possible, it makes the world a better place!

# Post Operative Instructions Following Root Canal Therapy

Congratulations on surviving the dreaded root canal. You’ll be happy to know that, according to the current literature, the five year success rate for root canals is over 90%.

It’s not uncommon for there to be some minor to moderate discomfort in the area after the root canal. It is normal for the tooth to be uncomfortable for 10 days after today’s treatment. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, the tooth and surrounding tissues may remain sore for a few weeks post treatment. This can be due to a number of factors which include soreness from the injection, soreness from placement of the rubber dam clip and from inflammation around the tip of the root.

Inflammation is a normal part of the healing process as your body rids the area around the tip of the tooth of the remains of the infected pulp tissue. Your tooth may be sensitive to biting pressure or the tooth may even feel loose. It’s all the result of the inflammation and sensitivity of the nerve ending in the tissue just outside the end of the root where we cleaned, irrigated and placed filler and sealer material.

DO NOT eat or drink anything for the next half hour. DO NOT “check out” the area with your tongue or finger. You have a temporary filling in the tooth and it takes about half an hour to harden. You are also numb and may damage your tissues.

DO NOT use the tooth to bite down on anything hard (peanuts, pretzels, ice, etc.) until the permanent crown has been placed on the tooth. The tooth is prone to fracture and if you bite down on anything too hard, it may cause damage.
---
# WHAT DO I DO IF THERE’S DISCOMFORT?

The primary line of defense against discomfort is over the counter medication. We recommend that you take 600 mg ibuprofen (three over the counter pills of Advil, Motrin or generic equivalent) every 6 hours for the next two days, OR if you are unable to take ibuprofen, 1000mg acetaminophen (two extra strength Tylenol or generic equivalent) every six to eight hours for the next two days. Most of the time this is enough to handle any discomfort.

You may also be given a prescription for an antibiotic and/or a prescription for a pain reliever. Fill the prescription for the antibiotic and begin taking the medication. Fill the prescription for the pain reliever only if you need it. It is our goal to ensure that you are comfortable.

If you have any questions or concerns I can be reached on my cell phone at 555.555.5555

# INFORMATION FOR DENTURE CARE

- It’s important that your dentures, like natural teeth, be kept free from plaque and tartar. This prevents permanent staining and bad breath. Use a denture brush and one of the many commercial cleaning products to thoroughly clean all of the surfaces of the denture at least once a day.
- Rinse your dentures after eating.
- Using a soft bristled brush, brush your remaining teeth, as well as your tongue, palate and gums. This not only removes plaque and keeps your breath fresh, it also massages your gums and stimulates circulation, keeping your natural teeth and tissues healthy.
- Tough stains and tartar can be removed by soaking your dentures in white vinegar for several hours. After you’ve cleaned your dentures, always remember to rinse them in water before placing them back in your mouth.
- If your dentures have no metal parts, you can soak them in diluted bleach solution to remove tough stains. Never soak your dentures in a cleaning solution for more than 15 minutes if they have any metal parts. Be sure to rinse them thoroughly before placing them in your mouth.
- Whenever they are out of your mouth, your dentures should be stored in water.
- Your gums need to rest each day, so don’t wear your dentures to bed at night.
- See us regularly for examinations to ensure your dentures fit properly and your mouth stays healthy.

- A temporary crown is less durable and meant to be easily removed by your doctor.
- Avoid eating hard, crunchy, or sticky foods until your permanent crown is ready.
- Avoid flossing directly around the temporary, this could cause it to loosen or come off.
- Please resume normal brushing immediately but be gentle around the temporary crown.
- Your gums may be sore for a few days following the procedure. You can rinse with warm salt water to help reduce pain and swelling. You can also take Tylenol or ibuprofen as needed for the pain.
---
● It is normal to experience sensitivity to temperature and pressure following the procedure. This should pass after your mouth adapts to the temp crown.

● Your temp crown may be shaped differently than your original tooth. Your tongue may magnify these differences but you will become accustomed to them in a few days.

● If your temp crown comes off during non-business hours, do not be alarmed. CVS and Walgreens sell temporary crown cement. Simply re-cement it with a small amount of this cement and call our office to schedule a follow up appointment.

# Care After Implant Surgery

Congratulations! You are the owner of a new dental implant. Implant surgery is 90% successful and in order to increase the chances of implant success it is important that you carefully follow these post surgery instructions.

1. Day of surgery do not disturb the area, avoid rinsing and spitting that day. A certain amount of bleeding is expected following surgery. Bleeding is controlled by applying pressure to the surgical area for 90 minutes, then you may eat or drink. If bleeding persists, a moist tea bag should be held firmly in the area of bleeding for 90 minutes.
2. Ice the surgical area (side of face) for first 4 hours, apply ice 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off.
3. For pain relief: for the first 24 hours only, take 2 - 200mg tabs of ibuprofen with 2 - extra strength tylenol every 6 hours, after that take 600mg ibuprofen every 6 hours (it may be helpful to eat 30 minutes prior to taking pain medication to prevent nausea).
4. Antibiotics: Take as prescribed until they are gone.
5. Drink Plenty of fluids (do not use a straw).
6. Diet: A proper diet is essential to healing. Soft foods are recommended. Stay away from sharp brittle foods (no popcorn, potato chips, etc.) Try to chew on the non-operated side of your mouth. Avoid citrus fruits, fruit juices, highly spiced foods and alcohol; these will cause pain.
7. Do not smoke for AT LEAST the first 5 days following surgery.
8. Rinsing: starting the day after surgery, rinse with warm salt water every 2-3 hours. Begin the prescription anti-bacterial mouth rinse 3 days after surgery or after the wound is healed. Rinse 2-3 times per day for 60 seconds with the prescription mouth rinse, continue to also mix in rinsing with warm salt water. Avoid all other mouth rinses until the doctor has informed you that the surgical site is fully healed.
9. Avoiding toothpaste for 72 hours following surgery will help healing. Simply brush with warm water and DO NOT disturb the surgical site. Also remember to brush your tongue to keep bacteria growth down.
10. DO NOT Chew on any exposed portion of implant.
11. Bruising and swelling may occur. Swelling is usually proportional to the surgery involved and swelling is at its peak in the first 48-72 hours. To control swelling: Ice on and off for the first 48 hours and apply warm compresses (warm wash rag) after that. If swelling appears abnormal, inform our office immediately.
12. If your jaw is sore: chewing sugar-free gum may help loosen the muscles. Make sure to keep your jaw moving so that muscles don't lock up.

# Verbal Post-Operative Instructions

Every new assistant gets a small pocket size notebook and they print out the abbreviated post op instructions below. They then tape them in their notebook and we inform them “I don’t need you to memorize the instructions, you can sit facing or stand behind the patient and read them off, but we must deliver verbal post op instructions in addition to the consents and written post op instructions. We also have videos on post op instructions for patients to reference.” (see below post op cheat sheet)

# Verbal Post-Operative responses to Common Questions

(this is also a helpful reference for front office / non-clinical team members that may field Post op questions over the phone)

# Fillings

# Sensitivity

Normal for a few days up to a few weeks. This will calm down with time.

# Soreness

You may be a little sore at the injection site of the anesthetic and this should only last a few days.

# Bite is off

Schedule appointment to have them come in for a bite adjustment if the bite feels high or if intense jaw pain occurs.

# BU/CRN

# Sensitivity

Normal for a few days up to a few weeks. This will calm down with time.

# Post Operative Instructions

# Soreness

You may be a little sore at the injection site of the anesthetic and this should only last a few days.

# Bite is off

Schedule appointment to have them come in for a bite adjustment if the bite feels high or if intense jaw pain occurs.

# Temp

Broken or if temp comes out, schedule for them to come in to have it recemented/remade.

# Ext/Implant

# Pain

Pain is normal for the first few days/week. The worst pain will be on days 2 and 3. Continue to take pain meds as prescribed. You can add 2 tylenol in addition to the motrin every 4-6 hours.

# Rinsing

We want to give the blood clots a chance to set up, so do not rinse for the first 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can rinse with a warm salt water rinse (1 tsp/8oz of water).

# Eating and Drinking

Soft foods in the extracted area and drinking is fine. NO ALCOHOL!!!

# Root Canal Therapy

# Pain

To clear the infection and reduce the pain, continue taking antibiotics and pain reliever. You can add 2 tylenol in addition to the motrin every 4-6 hours.

# Verbal Post Op Instructions After Treatment

# Fillings

“Soreness at the injection site and gums are to be expected. The tooth will likely be sensitive to temperature (hot/cold) and biting for several weeks and in some cases up to a few months, this is very common with tooth colored fillings but gets better with time.”

“If your bite feels off, please call us right away so we can get you in to adjust it, it’s often hard to tell when you are numb.”

“Be careful with the area since you are numb. Wait to eat until it wears off because we don’t want you to hurt yourself by chewing your cheek or tongue.”

If Pulp cap “the cavity was very deep, therefore we placed some medicine under the filling to help protect the nerve of the tooth. This is something we want to monitor so if this tooth starts to give you trouble, let us know.”
---
# Temporary Crown Post Op Instructions

POI “please do not floss around your temporary- if you feel the need to floss, pop the floss down and then pull it out towards your cheek to avoid taking the crown off. Remember to stay away from hard and sticky foods. We recommend not eating on it for the next few weeks if you can avoid it. We will have you back in 3-4 weeks to deliver your permanent crown. Expect some sensitivity to the tooth and soreness in the area. This could last for a few days up to a few weeks or months- everybody is different. If the bite feels high at all please let us know so we can get you in to adjust it. If the temp falls out at all, simply recement with toothpaste and call us so we can re-cement it for you.”

# Post-op calls Protocol

(Responsibility of the Dentist and Dental Assistants/Hygienists)

1. Post Op calls are to be made every day for all patients that got numb on prior clinical day.
2. Celi will do her Tuesday Post Op calls on Thursday, Jordyn will do her Wednesday Post Op calls on Friday, Cody will do his Friday Post op Calls on Tuesday, Celi will make Michelle’s Post Op calls from Wednesday on Thursday...If any team member is concerned they don’t have time to complete them, they will notify other team member who they need help calling. All calls must be done by end of day.
3. First Priority call Sedations, Extractions, Implants, Endo, Quadrant fillings.
4. Second Priority anyone else that got numb i.e. single crown, 1-3 fillings etc.
5. Document the date, time and any pertinent information from the post op call in the CommLog in Open Dental, if text copy and paste text in commlog.
6. By end of day every patient has been Post Op called or Texted Via FLEX (see below for sample PO call and text verbiage).

# Restorative Patients

All restorative appointments involving any anesthetic, prosthetic delivery, or any general concern deserve a post-op call from the DDS assistant.

Example Call: “Hi John, this is ________From ABC Dental Care! ☺ I am calling to make sure you are doing ok after your appointment yesterday and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye!☺”

Example Text “Hi John, this is ________From ABC Dental Care! ☺ I am reaching out to make sure you are doing ok after your appointment yesterday, please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything, have a great day!” (copy and paste the text in commlog)

NOTE: All post-op calls should be performed as soon as reasonably possible after the time of service. The next day is ideal, but not always possible.

# Hygiene Patients

All hygiene appointments deserve a post-op call the following day regarding their hygiene experience.
---
Example: “Hi John, this is Celi from ABC Dental Care! ☺ I am calling to make sure you had a pleasant experience yesterday with your cleaning and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye! ☺”

# Fillings:

If bite is high see if they can come in for an adjustment. Discomfort to hot, cold, chewing is normal, it can last for a few weeks up to several months, every patient and every tooth is different.

# Temp Crown:

If bite is high, get them in for a bit adjustment. Remind them to be careful with anything sticky or hard on the temp and to let us know if the temp comes off.

# Endo and Oral Surgery:

Tenderness is normal for 10 days, most discomfort is the first 72 hours after the procedure where inflammation is at its peak. (If given medications remind them to take as prescribed)

# Extraction:

Tenderness is normal, most discomfort is the first 48-72 hours. Every patient is different, some heal about in 2 weeks and some can heal for about 6 months.

# Post-Operative Directions Checklist

We have clear post-operative instructions for most procedures, and are trained to speak to the highlights of each in the same manner.

We train on the answers to the most frequently asked questions.

It can feel like boring repetition as you start to practice and become proficient in giving post-operative directions, however this is the first time each patient might be hearing these things. It is important to remember that this is a very critical part to the entire patient experience, and giving these directions out trains the patient on what to expect and will reduce the need for more phone calls or post-op appointments going forward.

# Chapter 8

# Ordering Systems and Dental Supplies

Ordering dental supplies is an important job duty of a great dental assistant. As a business, it is important to have the appropriate stock of supplies but also keep the budget in check. Here’s an excerpt from the Dental Success Network - Supply Ordering Manual. Many times we will see the Lead Assistant do most of the ordering for the office.

# Setting the Budget

To begin the process of keeping the budget in line, we need to start with setting up the budget and how to calculate our 4%. Once you work in a clinic long enough, you will see the pattern that sometimes our collections percentage is great, and sometimes it is horrible. We all have ups and downs, and so to smooth that out, we suggest taking a 3 month average of collections.

Note: We only suggest using collections when the production-to-collections percentage is 95% or above. In the case where you consistently have below 95% collections percentage, then you will need to use ‘net production’ as your budget baseline. Having below 95% collections percentage is also worrying because it means you have some operations issues in your collections policies or front desk systems. In this case, make sure to examine how you have such low collection numbers. Once you are back above 95% collections (hopefully 99%+), then switch back to using collections as the baseline number.

To take a 3 month average, begin by going to your Open Dental Reports > Standard, and run the ‘This Year’ report to see the monthly totals. Take the average of the last 3 months. See the example:
---
| |Production|Adjustments|Write-Offs|Net Production|Collections|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|August 23|299,946|-14,086|-98,883|186,976|222,048|
|September 23|354,273|-26,459|-62,735|265,077|193,797|
|October 23|407,668|-29,381|-100,232|278,054|277,777|
|Averages|Averages|Averages|Averages|243,369|231,207| | | |

In the example above, the collections % is right at 95% of ‘Net Production’, which means we are ok to still use collections as the base number for our supply percentage. Since the average of the last 3 months' collections is $231,207, that means that the supply budget set at 4% should be $9,248.28.

Place the number $231,207 into the top left corner of the ordering spreadsheet, this is your three month average that you will base your ordering budget on. For those of you who have practices that might do sedation or implants, having a target range for each subset of supplies is a great way to keep track of how much you want to spend on certain supplies each month. As mentioned above a great supply budget is usually set at 4%, so you will want to divide accordingly amongst your subset in your supply budget.

|Target Range|3.5%|0.50%|1%|0.25%|4.0%| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Average|$231,207|November 2023|$8,092.24|$1,156.04|$578.02|$9,248.28|

Date Ordered: 11/01/23

Vendor: Crazy Dental

In the example above, with a 4% supply budget, you could allocate 3.5% of that budget towards Dental Supplies and 0.50% to Sedation Supplies. In other costs that we love to track, we also include 1% for implants/Bone/Membrane and 0.25% towards Office Supplies and other non-categorized items.

Now, doing the math here you will realize that this adds up to more than 4%. That is because typically we take the Implants/Bone/Membrane out of our “Lab” Cost category, not the Dental Supplies. Many dentists on DSN choose to do it this way because as you do more implants, your revenues go up but lab percentages typically do not rise quite as much. You will also see that Office Supplies is listed here as a 0.25% cost category. This is because we like to keep all our costs on here where a team member is buying something, and so that they know exactly what the budget is and where they can spend money.
---
Your percentages for the supply categories should add up to your supply budget goal of 4%, but other categories might be useful to track on this spreadsheet as well. If you do many procedures that are in their own category (like Sedation), and you want to separate them, you are free to do that.

To calculate subset budgets you can take your average revenue, $231,207 for example, and multiply it by the predetermined percentage to calculate that subset budget for the month, as seen in the calculations above. The division of the budget depends upon what procedures are generally done at your office, so if Sedations are not something done in your office, but you do a lot of Endodontic procedures you could adjust categories accordingly per practice requirements.

# Cadence of Ordering

One of the most common questions we get when discussing ordering is how often to place orders in a busy office. This makes sense because it seems like our team members never have enough time to complete ordering each week. When they run short on time, they often forget to order some important supplies which puts the office in a pinch. So what is the best cadence?

We always suggest weekly evaluation of supply levels and weekly ordering. This is for a couple of reasons:

1. Weekly Schedules/Routines are easier to maintain
2. Weekly orders are smaller
3. Keep less supplies on hand

Weekly routines are simply easier to keep, if there’s something you do only every month or 6 months, it is harder to schedule in our busy lives. By keeping the cadence to a weekly routine, it is easy for one person to have that duty, and they get 1-4 hours each week to complete this task. This person should have no other duties, such as seeing patients, during these hours. Trying to mix in patient care and supply duties can lead to errors in the order and will take longer.

Note: The typical time it takes for a dental assistant (preferred person) to do this ordering can vary greatly, depending on the size of the office. In a small office, it might only take 1 hour per week. In a large office doing over $5 Million, it might take 4 hours per week. The systems set up at the beginning (given out in this book) will help save time down the road, as well as some certain softwares. Even at 4 hours a week, the hourly wage of the person doing the ordering is negligible to the savings they will earn for the business by keeping the supply budget in the desirable range.

If you order weekly, the orders tend to be smaller as well. This helps because it will take shorter amounts of time to both order and check in the supplies once they arrive. Trying to accept and track large orders can be quite a task if you only order once a month.
---
The final reason, and maybe the most important, is that you will keep a more appropriate amount of supplies in the office. To be the most efficient office, you want just the right amount of supplies on the shelves, in the operatories, and in the drawers. If you do bulk orders each month, then you need to have extra shelving space for large boxes, which can be wasteful. If you order only what you need for the next 3-4 weeks, then you always have just the right amount of supplies for any procedure.

# Creating a Formulary

Now we come to the most difficult part of creating an ordering system: the actual list of supplies you order. This might seem straightforward and simple, but it is absolutely not. To get this next part right, it will take up to 12 hours of work for someone to complete with accuracy and in a way that will help the office going forward. However, once it is completed, the system is extremely effective. What you will be creating over these 12 hours is called a Formulary. This is the name for the list of supplies that are approved for ordering in your office. If it is on the formulary, then it is approved to be ordered. If it’s not on the list, your team will need to ask for special approval for it.

To start creating this formulary, you will want to gather a list of each item you order in the office, broken down by categories. For example:

- Anesthetics
- Burs
- Cleaning / Infection Control
- Crown & Bridge
- Dentures
- Disposables
- Endodontics
- Hygiene
- Impression Materials
- Miscellaneous
- Oral Surgery & Implants
- Restorative
- Whitening
- X-Ray
- Office Supplies (Not Counted in the Supply Budget but still important to keep track of)

To make your life simple, we have a spreadsheet attached to this book that goes through all of these items above. As you go through each section, make sure you know all the supplies you might order in a 12 month period. For example, in the anesthetic category, you will want to list every needle size, anesthetic, protector sheath, topical, and sharps container. Now, even though sharps containers do not get ordered very often, they should be on the list because you would most likely order them at least one to two times per year.

252
---
The formulary should be very simple to understand and execute for anyone in the practice. With that in mind, if you want to re-prioritize these categories to make it more simple, we encourage that. There might also be other categories in your practice that you need to add to the formulary. Whatever it takes to make it a simple system for your office to order from a single list, we love it.

As you go through the list of items that you order or want to order, you will want to remember a few things. First of all, there are many different products and SKUs for products. If you have a favorite brand or type, make sure that you pick that brand for the formulary. If you are agnostic about which type of material it is, then make a note of that supply as well.

You will start to see the extreme price differences between generics versus brand names. In these cases, we suggest doing one small order of a new product to see whether that product will work well for you. In the case of 2 x 2 gauze, you might test that order where it’s 50% cheaper, only to find out that the weave and thickness are unworkable. However, sometimes when you order a new brand you will find that it is exactly the same thing, just with a different logo on the box. In this case, pat yourself on the back for saving a huge amount of money and still getting a good product.

As you look at a single supply, you will need to fill out as much data as possible in the attached spreadsheet:

|Description|QUANTITY in PK|Crazy Dental SKU|Crazy $|NET32 $|PureLife (Synergy) SKU|DARBY $| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ANESTHETICS|Lidocaine HCL 2% w/epi|50|999-AN401|$33.39|$40.01|$42.99|9515510|$34.18|

On the second tab after this ordering one, then you will also find a printable sheet with the same supplies, but without color. This sheet is easy for anyone to look at and help order:

|Description|QUANTITY in PK|When to order|Typical order|Quantity Needed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ANESTHETICS|Accuject 27g Short Needles|100|Half container empty|6 boxes|

This will take quite a bit of work to figure out when to order, and what is the typical order, but once completed it makes the ordering process so simple that almost anyone could do it. Even if the preferred ordering assistant is out of the office for a week, someone else in the office could execute the order easily.

253

254

255
---
256
---
Note: Some ordering services also add in shipping costs. When figuring out the lowest price, make sure to know whether it is from a place that charges shipping costs per order, or whether it’s free shipping.

There are a few other tactics that make a huge difference when ordering. First of all, you are going to go through this list and do a ton of work to find the lowest prices. However, prices do change over time - sometimes to a sickening level. We suggest that you check these prices every month or two to make sure you are still ordering from the best place and the lowest prices. Each month, set aside an hour or two to spot check some of the biggest costs of supplies that you have, and make sure that you still want to order the same supply from the same vendor.

257
---
In the last few years, we have seen prices change significantly with time so it seems like we are almost constantly changing at least a couple of supplies every month. This is normal, and the goal of this is to always stay below 4% of our total supply budget.

The second key point in order is that you will only order from this list. If you need something not on the list, then the ordering person should add it, do the research on the best places and prices, and then it can get ordered. Ordering new supplies and not checking prices is the death knell for any budget.

Finally, the last tab on the spreadsheet that is given to you is the password storage place. Because you will most likely have many different websites that you might check for price comparison, keeping all these passwords in one safe place will be important.

# When You Run Out of Budget

It will often happen, especially as you start this process, that you will get very close to or go over your goal percentage spent. This occurs frequently and is expected. When the ordering costs are nearing the target budget number, you will try to manage the ordering to move some things to next month, or possibly order slightly fewer supplies. Rather than getting a 4-week supply, maybe you could get by with only a 2 week supply. That might help push the next 2 week order into the next month, thereby saving this month’s budget.

However, sometimes managing supply levels just does not cut it. When this occurs, the ordering assistant will need to go to the doctor or owner and check that they are ok to order these supplies. Once they get approval, which should almost always be approved if it’s truly needed, then the order can be placed. When the owner knows that the budget was over-shot by an amount, then they can be prepared for their goal percentage not being hit once end-of-month reports are prepared.

# Tracking Orders

When ordering you should use one email address for all ordering sites, this will help to keep all payment and shipping information in one place that can be reviewed at a later time. We suggest creating an office email such as “ordering@_______.com” This way, the purpose of the email is clear. Once an order is placed, you should receive a confirmation email from the supplier confirming your purchase. We suggest that you always check for confirmation emails because some sites have multiple step processes to finalize an order, you do not want to miss placing an order due to failure to complete the order on the website.

We recommend that you have your preferred person check the email inbox every 1-2 days for updates on order processing and tracking numbers from suppliers. Remember different suppliers tend to have different delivery schedules, depending on your supplier it can take anywhere from 2-5 days to receive your supplies, or sometimes a week-plus. So when ordering certain supplies you must keep in mind how quickly you can receive products, which could adjust how often you are ordering specific supplies.
---
Once your shipment has been received we suggest crossing off the received supplies from the invoice that is provided with the shipment. This is to ensure two things:

1. That you have received the correct quantity of supplies ordered
2. To make sure that everything on your order has been shipped with the order

By checking off what you have received, and put away, you will ensure that you will not miss any supplies. If your shipment is missing supplies you should first check with the supplier’s websites to see if any supplies are back ordered. If the site shows that it should have shipped, call your supplier to see about sending missing supplies as soon as possible.

A great way to keep track of completed and uncompleted orders is to have two separate folders to put invoices in. Closed or complete invoices can be put in the completed folder to save. We recommend saving invoices for the month to compare to your monthly statement from your bank to check for any discrepancies. By keeping your incomplete, or open, invoices separately, you can keep track of what supplies you are still waiting on. Once received, you can move the invoice into the completed folder. Keeping track of previous invoices, shipment times, and the efficiency of suppliers will help you to determine when and where to order items for your inventory.

# Setting Up Tip-Out Bins and Operatory Bins

One of the biggest drags on ordering budgets is when we order more than we need, primarily because we don’t know how much is stocked in the practice. This typically occurs when supplies are tucked away in cabinets, drawers, and other places that cannot easily be seen. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

This next section is going to show you a system where you can easily show what supplies are available and in stock, both in your central dispensing area as well as operatories. First off, all supplies get stocked and opened in the dispensing area, which for most of us is a mix of sterilization and shelving. The best strategy we’ve seen for this is to have both shelves available for supplies, as well as clear tip-out bins.

The shelving, whether it is wired or solid wood, should have pieces of blue painter’s tape on it to show where the necessary supplies are placed, within those lines. When there is a good 3-4 week supply of the item, it should reach the front of the shelf. As it gets used and supplies dwindle, then the front moves backward.
---
When the supplies start to get too far back from the front edge of the shelf, they should get added to the week’s order. Sometimes you might want to put a piece of painter's tape at the ‘critical level’ where the supply gets re-ordered.

# Tip-Out Bins

The next, and most important, piece of equipment to have in the practice are called tip-out bins. They are clear bins that can be hung on any wall where you can store dental supplies. (Popular also for children’s LEGOs or other toys!) The most popular setups are from Simplastics, found here: https://simplastics.com/bins-containers/clear-tip-out-bins/dental.

Here’s a QR Code for those who want to go directly to that page. We suggest using the SIM26WF or the SIM244WF. The first option, as shown on the left in the picture, has a few smaller bins that are good if you are storing a lot of smaller supplies. The option on the right has larger bins, which is sometimes preferable as well.

In the attached documents for this book, we will include a spreadsheet where you can plan what you want to store in each of your tip-out bins.
---
Each tip-out bin should either be clearly labeled or have a ‘key’ off the side as to which bin is used for each supply. It should also be so clear that you might not even need a label after you get it set up.

When a supply gets low, like the left picture, then you will know you need to re-order. After a re-supply, it looks like the picture to the right.

261
---
The tip-out bins are only the first part of a well-organized office supply system. The second is clear bins for each operatory. These bins are manufactured by many places, but the best depth/size that we have found is from the manufacturer called Plano. These are sold in Walmart or on Amazon.com and usually for around $10. The ideal model number we recommend is Plano 23730-05.

When set up correctly, these will hold many of the supplies you need for everyday procedures. Typically you will need two of these for each operatory for all the regular bread-and-butter types of dentistry, however, you might need a 3rd or 4th if you also do surgery or endodontics out of the operatory and need more specialized supplies for those procedures.

The philosophy/system starts with all supplies being stocked in central sterilization/dispensing and then placed into the clear bins in each operatory each day. At the end of the day, or when supplies get low in the operatory, a team member takes these bins back to the central dispensing and refills them. Since the operatory bins and tip-out bins are all clear, it is easy to see the supply levels at a quick glance. Here are a few example pictures of bins:
---
After you have them set up, you can always use an aluminum slat wall on the rear operatory wall to keep these, if not choosing to store them in any drawers.

263
---
If you are interested in using the slatwall anywhere in the office, this brand with this link is a good one. Choose the correct size, or have a contractor cut it down to the width you need. We then went to a custom metal fabricator for the angled shelf that was designed specifically for the storaway that we got.

# Keeping Dental Equipment Working

There are few things that can ruin your day faster than some of your most important equipment breaking. Maybe the sterilizer doesn’t work, the handpiece stops spinning, or the dental unit starts sprouting water everywhere. To avoid having some of these bad days, it’s a good idea to maintain the equipment in the best way possible to prevent issues from starting in the first place.

Here’s some of our best resources around maintaining the equipment in the best way possible.

# Equipment Maintenance Checklist

FOR DETAILED MAINTENANCE STEPS, REFER TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE THAT CAME WITH YOUR EQUIPMENT OR CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER DIRECTLY

Some of these items need a checklist to be created, others should be routine habits.

# AFTER EACH PATIENT

- Clean, lubricate and sterilize handpieces
- Clean (with ultrasonic) and sterilize syringe tips
- Wipe down and flush handpiece tubing
- Flush vacuum lines (after oral surgery procedures)
- Clean/disinfect touch and transfer surfaces
- Replace all barriers

# DAILY (OR AS NEEDED)

- Refill water bottles and use appropriate waterline maintenance product
- Flush cuspidor for one minute
- Clean cuspidor and screen

# Equipment Assignments:

Here is a detailed list of all of the areas of the office that need ongoing attention, who is the master of that domain, who is second in line in the case that person is not there, what vendor to contact in certain situations and what their contact information is, youtube videos referencing how to complete this task. You see we are hedged in multiple ways with an organized system like this. I have not included our vendor list- as your vendors will vary, however, we encourage you to make a document and hyperlink it to this document - make sure this list is thorough and comprehensive so anyone in the office could help in solving issues around the office.

# Critical 5 Equipment List

There are 4 pieces of equipment that can really ruin your day, and potentially stop you from doing dentistry. If your suction goes out, the compressor doesn’t push air, the sterilizer doesn’t sterilize instruments, or the server stops working - these can all stop you dead in your tracks. Even having the inability to take radiographs can also stop you from being productive. Here’s that list.

- Air Compressor
- Vacuum
- Autoclave
- X-rays
- Server

With each of these pieces of equipment, you will want to have a plan in place for what the equipment is, where it was purchased from, and what to do in case that it becomes inoperable.

# Equipment Maintenance Checklist

|Equipment|Date of Eval|Rep or Tech Name|Manufacturer Name|Serial#|Estimated Age|Recommended Replacement Model - When needed|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Compressor| | | | | | |
|Vacuum| | | | | | |
|Server| | | | | | |
|X-ray| | | | | | |
|Autoclave| | | | | | |
|Other| | | | | | |

We have checklists for maintaining each piece of equipment.

We know and use the correct time frame for maintaining each piece of equipment.

We have assigned these tasks to a specific person in the office.

We understand the “critical” pieces of equipment and have the right systems in place if one of those pieces breaks.

When equipment goes down, this can ruin your day and week. Using these checklists and knowing what to do in case of these emergencies will make sure the office runs well and hopefully avoids any downtime associated with broken equipment.

# Dental Assistant Testing

As you start to hire and train new assistants into the office, you will want to make sure that they have the same knowledge as some of the other expert dental assistants. To adequately complete this onboarding process, you will want to give them tests about different aspects of their job to assess their competency. This next chapter includes tests around many different subjects, and can be used when onboarding your next assistant to the team.

In addition, have you ever sat down to do “training” and get caught up wondering “what am I going to train on” or worse, put off training because you need to “take time to write up training documents”? Don’t worry about this anymore! We found that turning training into a quiz format has led to quicker assistant growth and really nice engagement during calibration meetings. Simply grab one of these quizzes and go around the room, you will be amazed with the additional questions you get from the team and increased clarity that they have after going through quizzes as a group. (Note: you may have your own preferences that differ from ours, so update your quiz accordingly).

A digital copy of all of these tests are available in the downloadable documents section in the resources given with this book.

# Assistant Testing Checklist

We have tests for dental assistants that check off their knowledge. We know and use these tests in on-boarding and when assistants want to learn and grow in their position. Training dental assistants can be hard, but these tests make it easy by “gamifying” the process. Use these throughout the process, and even in everyday practice, to help make sure that assistants are becoming the most knowledgeable and trained individuals around the dental work that goes on in the practice.

# Chapter 11

# Dentures

Depending on your demographic and scope of your practice, you either perform a lot of removable dentistry or very little. In some practices, they do very little removable, therefore, when it comes to dentures- they might feel uneducated. It might be that few team members feel good because they do not get enough repetition to feel comfortable. We understand that removable dentistry is ever changing with advancements in digital dentistry (digital dentures) as well as the popularity of All-on-X procedures, and the scope of this chapter is to provide somewhat of a cheat sheet to cover all the bases of traditional removable dentistry. This will include types of prosthesis, how to write up lab slips, the steps to the denture process, proper setups, and the psychology of explaining removable prosthesis to patients. You will have your own process, so this is simply a guideline to review with your assisting team and then customize to your practice.

Finally, many times assistants are confused by the steps in making removable products for patients, so we want to clearly lay out to them how to schedule and what the proper codes are. It’s important to get paid for all the things you are doing especially if you’re on PPO fees. Don’t forget to add things like alveoplasty, and be proactive informing patients about relines or definitive dentures when doing an immediate. Over the years we’ve found the more you tell the patient up front and document regarding these down the road costs and struggles with removable dentures, the better off you are in having those future conversations.

We will start off by showing the denture tray setups, needed equipment, and steps to accomplish at each appointment.

You can mark the position of the lip with an explorer to know where it is positioned.*
2. Determine Vertical Dimension. (the face is divided into 3 sections. The forehead to top of the nose, the top of the nose to the bottom of the nose, and the bottom of the nose to the chin.) This should be the exact same distance between each.
3. Lip support (how full/ “puffed out” the lips appear/feel; don’t want the lips to be too sunken in)

# Denture Information

The doctor and his staff have diagnosed your oral condition as being irreversible and we are recommending dentures as your only alternative. There are a few items you need to be aware of in order to be properly prepared for dentures. The first is that dentures are prosthetic devices designed to replace a body part that you have lost, or are about to lose. If you lost a limb such as a leg, the prosthetic device to replace that leg would never be as good as what you originally possessed. The same is true of dentures. They will never be able to imitate the real thing. You’ll never be able to chew the same, speak the same, or look like you have in the past. The dentures will move in your mouth, get food under them, and make your gums sore. The lower denture will be worse.

# Previous Denture Wearers

If you have had dentures in the past and we are making a new set of dentures for you, be prepared for a surprise! It will be a whole new experience. The dentures you’ve had in the past become a part of you as time passes. With new dentures the sensations, looks and feel will never be the same as your old dentures. So be prepared for a new feel and especially a new appearance. You will also get sore spots in new locations.

# Relining Dentures

If we are recommending relining your denture, don’t expect much from a reline. You will still feel looseness especially in the lower dentures. A laboratory reline is preferred to an in office reline and with a laboratory reline we require taking your dentures from you for 24-48 hours.

# Appointment Scheduling

If we are making immediate dentures they will be ready to be delivered at the time of surgery or removal of your teeth. We will need a preliminary appointment to fabricate your denture.

1. First Appointment: preliminary impressions of your jaws
2. Second Appointment: Final Impressions of your jaw with a custom made tray
3. Third Appointment: bite registration or measurement of the way your jaw works
4. Fourth Appointment: preliminary try in, called a wax try-in
5. Fifth Appointment: deliver dentures and surgery

# Information for Denture Care

- It’s important that your dentures, like natural teeth, be kept free from plaque and tartar. This prevents permanent staining and bad breath. Use a denture brush and one of the many commercial cleaning products to thoroughly clean all of the surfaces of the denture at least once a day.
- Rinse your dentures after eating.
---
● Using a soft bristled brush: brush your remaining teeth, as well as your tongue, palate and gums. This not only removes plaque and keeps your breath fresh, it also massages your gums and stimulates circulation, keeping your natural teeth and tissues healthy.

● Tough stains and tartar can be removed: by soaking your dentures in white vinegar for several hours. After you’ve cleaned your dentures, always remember to rinse them in water before placing them back in your mouth.

● If your dentures have no metal parts, you can soak them in dilute bleach solution to remove tough stains. Never soak your dentures in a cleaning solution for more than 15 minutes if they have any metal parts. Be sure to rinse them thoroughly before placing them in your mouth.

● Whenever they are out of your mouth, your dentures should be stored in water.

● Your gums need to rest each day, so don’t wear your dentures to bed at night.

● See us regularly for examinations to ensure your dentures fit properly and your mouth stays healthy.

● Always let us know right away if you notice any changes in your bite or fit.

# Steps to a Full Set of Dentures (for patient)

Dentures do not just merely give you back your smile, they also improve your life by helping you eat better. Whether you need a new set of dentures or a replacement, your dentist should be able to help you feel comfortable during the entire process.

The process of getting a new set of dentures may vary for each patient. Depending on your current oral health condition, you may need to visit your dentist several times to ensure that you will get an accurate evaluation. During this evaluation the dentist will look at any remaining teeth to determine if they need to be pulled or if they can be used to help support the denture itself. Generally, it may take up to six weeks to finish your new set of dentures.

Many denture patients have questions about the various steps involved so this guide walks you through the entire process.

# Measurements and First Impressions

It would be great if everything can be done in just one visit. However, you need to know that it does not work that way.

Dentures replace your missing teeth. Before you can start wearing them, your dentist normally requires you to undergo a thorough dental examination. Generally, dentures start with an impression or the mold of your mouth. Partial dentures require a careful measurement and examination of your gums, teeth, and mouth.

The measurement process is pretty simple. The dentist will look at any remaining teeth and determine if they can be used for supporting a denture or if they need to be removed. It's usually best to have some.
---
# Bite Registration

Following the impressions is the bite registration. Depending on the overall condition of your natural teeth and gums, your dentist will ask you to bite down a soft wax. This step is important because it helps your dentist check the current line up of your existing teeth as well as your upper and lower jaw. In addition, this step is vital because it effectively ensures that your new dentures will feel right and work right.

# Wax Try-In

At this stage, you will be able to see what your smile looks like when you are already wearing your dentures. During this step, you will have an initial experience as to how your dentures will look and feel. At the same time, you will also see the color and size of your dentures. If there are necessary changes, you can discuss it with your dentist at this point.

# The Final Product

Many times our dental patients have a few natural teeth and just need partial dentures. The process is almost the same for a full set of dentures and a partial denture. Partial dentures use the natural teeth as supports and they just fill in the gaps. Once the denture mold is created it is sent off to a denture lab where they make the final product. Usually this process can be done within a few days to a week at most.

Once the denture is returned the patient will then come into the office and a final fitting will be done. If the denture doesn't fit well, then the dentist can work with the denture to create the perfect fit. It's very rare that the denture has to be returned to the lab.

As you can see the process of getting dentures takes a little bit of time, but once you have your initial set of dentures you can always get another replacement set made quicker. It's the initial set that takes time to create.

# Invisalign & Cosmetic Cases

Invisalign or clear aligner therapy is largely a team driven process. Once we have our dental assistants trained up on how the process goes, the providers should not have to do a ton of hands-on work with it. With that said, systems and efficiency are critical to case acceptance and setting the team up to deliver quality care of our patients. This chapter lays out all things invisalign for our practice. If you are an invisalign provider we recommend joining DSN and checking out DNTL.LIFE for awesome invisalign lab savings.

- Review Retainer Instructions
- Wear retainers for 2 months as normal just like invisalign
- After 3 months of finishing TX, wear retainers strictly at night

# Invisalign Refinements

# New itero scan

# Pull up patient profile on Invisalign site

- Additional Aligners then begin to fill out prescription

# Financial Arrangements

It has been our experience that invisalign is often an impulse buy. With that said we need to be able to quickly discuss financial options. We prefer the doctor grab this financial options sheet and sit shoulder to shoulder with the patient to discuss (this is following the presentation of how invisalign works and we know the patient is very interested in treatment). When they say “I need to think about it or talk to my spouse we have them take a photo.

Ideally we already know whether or not they have adult ortho coverage. The one side of this laminated sheet shows the cost in the event they have ortho coverage and the other side is with no ortho coverage. If they have more than $2,000 in ortho coverage then we just tell them how great that is and that their fee will be even lower than depicted here. Then the treatment coordinator has a binder with pre-printed financial arrangements for all of the ortho payment scenarios. They can quickly rip out the appropriate financial arrangement and bring that to the patient to sign and collect payment. We prefer this to the generic open dental print out because we have flexible payment options that aren’t quickly or easily depicted inside open dental. The Treatment Coordinator would scan the signed FA into the chart and make commlog notes about the financial arrangement discussion. When patient leaves they would enter the in office payment plan in open dental if appropriate.

# Invisalign Case Treatment Financial Workup

# A. Adult or Child that has In-Network Covered Orthodontic Coverage

Our Fee for Comprehensive Adult Orthodontics (D8090) is $5,900, with certain insurance companies that we are in-network with the allowed amount is less, for example Delta will honor $4,526. With invisalign treatment we incur a significant lab bill and in order to make this procedure profitable in our office we will need to make up the difference from insurance discounts. This will be done by utilizing an “upgrade lab fee” for premium orthodontic materials. It can be found by searching “Invisalign- including vivera retainers” in open dental codes. This code will NOT be sent to insurance and is an in house code. The fee for this will be customized to make up the difference between the insurance allowed amount and our fee of $5,900 and is ultimately the patient’s responsibility. In addition, the patient will need to sign the “material upgrade consent” form. This explains that invisalign is a premium material and it will include their vivera retainers after treatment is complete.

Verbiage for “material upgrade consent”: “Your insurance does not actually cover invisalign they cover basic orthodontics. This form explains that you understand that you are responsible for the invisalign upgrade.”

Double click on the highlighted area to change the “Fee”

*YOU WILL CHANGE THE FEE TO WHATEVER $ WILL ADD UP TO THE $5900 THAT WE CHARGE FOR INVISALIGN*

---
# A. Out of network and covered we bill our normal fee code D8090

# a. Adult or Child where Ortho is not a covered benefit

If orthodontics is not a covered benefit on the patients plan we are not required to honor the “In-Network” fee. Patient is responsible for the full fee (see document Payment Options: Invisalign, Implants, Cosmetic). D8090 will not be billed to insurance and the patient must sign “Request to Restrict Disclosure” form which explains that since this is not a covered benefit we will not be submitting this procedure to your insurance.

# Invisalign Payment Options ($5,900)

# Lending Point:

- They do a soft credit check before the patient needs to commit
- They approve down to a 590 credit score
- Up to 60 months financing for 1% to practice, which is less than a credit card financing charge
- Practice gets paid within 72 hours of approval
- Can use Lending Point with any procedure, not just invisalign

|Term|Practice Interest Rate|Patient Interest Rate|
|---|---|---|
|12 Months|8%|0%|
|24 Months|10%|0%|
|36 Months|1%|% based off their approval rate (Caroline recommended throwing in the Vivera retainers for free/complimentary)|

# MATERIAL/COSMETIC UPGRADE SERVICE AGREEMENT

At times our doctor(s) may recommend materials which are above and beyond what is covered by your Insurance Company, and/or included as a standard per the Current Dental Terminology as represented by the American Dental Association.

When the doctor feels the presented necessary treatment can be improved to create a more stationary restoration by utilizing an upgraded material, he/she will advise you to choose the upgraded materials as recommended.

As always, our doctor’s number one concern is to treat you with the most advanced material and services available to improve the outcome and longevity of a healthy smile.

“I understand the doctor has my best interest in mind. At this time, I am accepting upgraded materials at my doctor’s recommendation to better treat my present condition(s). I understand the upgrade of the materials, above and beyond what is covered by my insurance company, which can generate additional charges due over the standard fees agreed upon with my insurance company or dental network.”

# Cosmetic Case Acceptance Workflow

# Appointment 1 (Initial)

- Hygienist or Assistant Identifies case and takes 3 DSLR photos and loads onto computer
- Doctor Exam- (cosmetic exam form completed)
- Veneer Explainer Video
- Treatment Coordinator collects $300 and schedules mounted models appointment and gives patient cosmetic magazine / book
- Assistant makes QuickSplint

# Appointment 2 (Mounted Models) - Can be done same day as appt 1 if time allows

- Assistants and Dr. complete mounted models protocol
- Send to Gold Dust for pindexed models and before and after digital mockup
- TC: Schedules case presentation with spouse
- Prepares financial arrangements for next visit

# Appointment 3 (case presentation)

- Present Powerpoint / Mounted Models / panadent models / Invisalign
- Play Veneer video (if spouse has not seen)
- Present Financial Options
- Must sign “request to restrict disclosure” and “material upgrade” consents
- If accepted send for Wax Up (collect $)
- If not accepted put on audit list
- Send a follow up email …

# Cosmetic Crown/Veneer Upgrade

If patient HAS crown or veneer coverage

- Enter the treatment as normal
- Then add additional code “DRCosmCRN” that will NOT be billed to insurance to get us closer to our Cosmetic Crown fee of $2,000.00
---
This fee will auto-populate to $155, but based on which insurance company the patient has, the fee we will charge for the Cosmetic Crown Upgrade will be different to equal $2,000.00 between the contracted rate and custom fee for Cosmetic Crown Upgrade.

- Change the highlighted amount to whatever $ will make up the difference between the contracted rate and total cost of Cosmetic Crown.
- Example of a Delta Patient:
- $850 contracted rate + $950 cosmetic crown upgrade = $2,000 Cosmetic Crown Fee
- Make sure the “Do Not Bill to Ins” box is checked
- On the Treatment Plan, it should look like this
- Print Treatment Plan
- Make sure each Cosmetic Crown has an upgrade fee with the correct amount of “X” depending on the insurance company
---
- Have patient sign the TX Plan, in addition to the Material Upgrade Fee Form
- If patient does NOT have crown or veneer coverage
- Enter TX into Open Dental
- On the Treatment Plan, it should look like this
- *We will NOT present this TX plan in Open Dental to patients!
- Print and fill out the Request To Restrict Disclosure Form

# Chapter 13

# Resources

This chapter contains various resources and checklists that will aid you in developing a black belt level practice.

# Office Fundamentals Spreadsheet

The office fundamentals spreadsheet arose because it seems to me that in a dental office we are constantly revisiting the same important things over and over that are foundational to running a sophisticated dental practice. As we chase shiny new objects we lose focus on the systems that got us there and when the foundational or fundamental systems begin to slip, so does our team thus our frustrations compound and we find ourselves stuck in managing and plugging holes. Wouldn’t it make more sense to be abundantly clear to the team “Hey these are the systems and protocols that must always be spot on in order to mitigate chaos and increase the predictability in the dental practice thus free us up to focus on bigger things.” The leads then can maintain these systems and train new team members on them. In our office I even have KPIs to for example track cancellations and confirmations. When I see cancellations tick in the wrong direction I then call the front office in for a quick touch up training, the result, the weeks following I see the cancellations go down. Yes, something like cancellations is largely out of our control, but there are aspects of this that can help us mitigate them, so let’s focus on what is in our control - our training, our system and our effort to influence the outcome we desire.

# Assistant Responsibilities Checklist

As a dental assisting team grows, it is important for new assistants to have the opportunity to have areas of expertise or domains within the office that they oversee. We listed out below all of the major areas needing attention and we divide these domains amongst the assistants. The lead and most senior assistants typically maintain the most important tasks and areas of expertise. This is written out in addition to the department daily checklist and whenever there is a question about any of these areas of the office we now know exactly who to go ask.

# Treatment Plan Sheet

We like this exam sheet which is recorded by the assistant, treatment coordinator or hygienist as the doctor relays findings from the exam, this is then put into open dental. The extra step allows us to also write notes and we scan into the chart for liability purposes, also if we have to go back and double check any treatment recommendations. The doctor should always confirm for accuracy.

# Route Slip Protocol

# APPOINTMENTS TO BE SET COMPLETE BY THE PROVIDERS ONLY. DAs and FO do not set appt. complete.

# Front Office:

- At the end of day, make sure all appointments are set complete
- Confirm the provider before sending the claim (The provider will set the appointments complete)

# Hygiene:

- Set appointments complete when the patient leaves.
- Make sure the correct codes are attached to the appointment before setting complete to ensure claim is ready to be sent

# Restorative:

- Collection is okay to be taken at the beginning of the appointment, this amount is noted on the appointment.
- If treatment changes mid appointment:
- - Stop clinical work so that assistant can add the new treatment into Open Dental
- If a small procedure is added, continue with the treatment
- If a large procedure, or multiple procedures are added, have the treatment coordinator come back and let the patient know of the new patient portion.
- At the end of the appointment, bring the route slip up with the new treatment written at the top and ask a treatment coordinator if the new procedure code is correct and what the new patient portion is. (Treatment coordinator should write the new patient portion on the top of the route slip for the assistant to relay back to the patient in the op.)
- Walk the patient out and confirm again that the codes on the appointment are correct and get approval from the Doctor to set the appointment complete. (If a treatment coordinator is not available to confirm, mark the appointment as dismissed and leave the appointment as scheduled).

If nothing changed, set the appointment complete as it was.
- FOR NOTES: Doctors will set appointments complete once procedures are correct. If you need to make a note in the chart, ask Dr. to set it complete to do so.
