# Systems=Notes

# System Tan operating protocol organized into a checklist.

Each staff member must become accountable for their particular set of job duties.

# Steps to systemize a business:

1. Create a list of job titles for your practice
2. Assign specific duties to each job title.
3. Create corresponding checklists to ensure all duties are remembered and performed:

# Job Titles

Create a list of job titles for your practice. You must have at least 3 front office job titles.

Examples:

- Receptionist
- Treatment Coordinator
- Patient Care Coordinator
- Billing Specialist
- Department Head
- Scheduler
- Hygiene Patient Coordinator
- Insurance Coordinator
- Dental Assistant
- Office Manager
- Greeter
- Financial Coordinator
- Collections Specialist
- Dental Hygienist
- Dentist

Create the titles needed, without any thought to who you would assign the title to. Do not say "Mary's like an insurance coordinator." Instead, say "my practice needs an insurance coordinator; who would fill that role best?"

# Take-Home Messages

# Job Titles

Job titles are created for the practice: Each person assigned to their particular job title will become a specialist for those duties. They will be trained specifically, will be held accountable, and they will receive recognition for those duties. By doing this, we eliminate a lot of wasted work between staff, and minimize the chaos of office management:

# List of duties

All office duties are organized according to job title. A job title must be assigned primary responsibility, and another title be assigned for backup.

# Frequency of duties

All duties are then summarized under each job title, and are assigned a frequency (day, week, month, or per patient): This will form the foundation for creating the Scheduled and Assembly Line checklists.

# Scheduled Checklist

This is a single page list of duties for one job title for an entire month: This is formed based on how frequent job duties must be performed:

# Assembly Line Checklist

This is a single page list of duties for a process—each time a patient is seen. It follows the patient, and travels from team member to team member. Even after the patient leaves the office, the assembly line checklist still travels, as insurance claims are submitted and final audits are performed: The assembly line checklist is shredded once complete: This checklist serves as the main tool in auditing staff:

# Manuals

Staff take one item per day from their checklist and write a "how to" guide, using screen shots and written instructions. In one month, the entire office is systemized with manuals.

# Training New Staff

With the help of the Manual, Scheduled Checklist, and Assembly Line Checklists, staff training becomes very efficient and organized. No longer must a practice hire staff based on experience.

# Changing Systems

Changes are now easily implemented using checklists. They are simply added to the checklist as a constant reminder of the new change. This creates predictability and ease of implementation:

Systems 12

# Systems Implementation

# Job titles and duties

Select the key job titles, and make sure to have at least three front office titles. Using the list of duties provided, assign job titles to each duty: Then, assign each staff member a job title.

# Making the checklists

With help from your staff, compile the duties under each job title, and set the frequency (day, week, month, patient):

- Create the Monthly Master Checklist (scheduled checklist), making sure to fit everything for one month onto one sheet of paper per job title:
- Create the Assembly Line Checklist for all duties needing to be performed per patient:
- Use the checklists included in this manual as a guide, and customize it for your practice.

# Creating the manual and write a "how to" guide

Have each staff person take one duty from their checklists per day. This should be in paragraph form, and should include pictures, screenshots, forms, etc: After one month, you should have all job duty "how to" guides created by your team.

Organize these Guides into manuals assigned to each job title: For example, a manual for your Scheduler would contain her monthly checklist, an assembly line checklist, and all needed explanations for performing those duties.

# Training and auditing

Once these items are created, you must have a training session so that they can be implemented. Audit these checklist items every day for the first 30 days to ensure that implementation is successful. Then, audit once per week, or as often as you see needed:

# ASSEMBLY LINE CHECKLIST

Every time a patient is seen in the office, many people have to perform many tasks properly: In order to help keep everyone organized and not forgetting any steps, we have created an Assembly Line Checklist. This sheet of paper has all of the steps needed to be completed every time a patient visits our office. In the following pages, we will describe in detail how to do each item under the "Assistant/Hygienist" section of the checklist:

# Assistant/Hygienist

|Seat Patient|Perform prophy, sealants, fluoride|
|---|---|
|Mark pt as 'in treatment room'|Give patient heated facial towel|
|Select TV station for patient|Record needed in chart|
|Enter and update medical history in chart|Set Urgent, Preventative, Cosmetic; and 1|
|Take blood pressure, record in notes|Assign correct provider|
|Record chief complaint; put picture on screen|Dr. doesn't take care of this soon, it might..|
|Take x-rays|Schedule next recall|
|Explain measurements, call out loud, record|Give patient appt card|
|Explain Diagnodent; record 2C-readings|Give patient 'Hygiene Sheet'|
|Record existing restorative|Give patient goodie bag|
|Tell pt what you see and what Dr will review|Introduce pt to tx coordinator|
|Fill out exam sheet; give to DDS|Say out loud the Urgency Statement|
|Give patient heated neck pillow|Turn over room|

SIF THE DOCTOR DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS SOON .⁹⁹

It's important to state to patients the importance of dental treatment for disease processes that have already begun. Show then the image of the concern explaining the need for the doctor to examine the area for treatment as well as any future complications that might be needed if treatment is not completed. Use descriptive words to explain what is seen in the image such as shadows, colors, and use cursor to pinpoint area.

Explain concern to patient and avenues of treatment without diagnosing any treatment: Use plain terminology to help patient understand what is happening in their mouth. Reassure patient that the DDS will come in and inform clinical team for directed treatment.

REMEMBER THE PATIENT IS DEPENDING ON YOU TO HELP THEM THROUGH THISW!

# TAKE X-RAYS

Sit patient back up and let them know you are now going to take the X-rays needed for the DDS to see the extent of the complaint and any other possible concerns. Begin with the Panorex at the end of the main clinical hall. Setup XRD program before having patient step up to Pano machine.

Open XDR, select new exam then click auto capture. Then you will be able to turn on Pano machine. Place the lead vest hanging on the wall adjacent to the pano on the patient: Explain to patient how the pano will work and help them into the correct position. After exposure, save pano by clicking the "SAVE TO RECORDS" button: Escort patient back to operatory, explain the rest of the radiographs will take place there.

Gather X-ray equipment: Sensors (size 1 and 2) hang by the pano machine. As well as the Nomad (handheld x-ray) unit: Plug sensor into the HDMI slot of the computer: Then bring up the new exam in the XDR, choose 4 BWX exam: Be sure to save exam after, then you can click "EDIT EXAM" to rotate images if necessary:

# EXPLAIN GUM MEASUREMENTS

After re-seating patient, explain to them the next step in obtaining a complete dental examination. Explain that you are going to "measure their gum" to see if there is an infection. Never tell a patient you are going to do a "probing." Tell them that you will call off numbers. Any numbers 4 or higher are a sign that they have an infection eating away at their bone. You should call in an assistant to help you chart the gum measurements in Open Dental:

# Every adult new patient should receive a full-mouth probing:

# PERFORM DIAGNODENT LASER CAVITY TEST

Use the Diagnodent to test the pits and fissures of posterior teeth for decay: Have the patient hold the unit as you perform the test: Tell them that "the laser cavity test finds cavities, even when they are really small. If you hear a funny noise, that's a signal that there's a cavity in that tooth."

Write down all measurements of 20 or great on the exam sheet:

# DISCUSS WHAT DDS WILL REVIEW

After you have completed your initial assessments and recorded the results you can explain to the patient what things are concerning to you and the health of your patient: Let them know the Doctor will come in and look at these areas and diagnose the next steps needed: Inform them that the Doctor will explain any procedures but that the office treatment coordinator will be involved with the insurance and scheduling of any needed appointments.

# FILL OUT EXAM SHEET

Compile all the information onto the exam sheet found in the hygiene room. Make sure all the spaces are filled placing a "NO" for areas not applicable to the patient, such as implant consults: Be sure to include the time the patient needs to leave by, this will allow the DDS to schedule in the exam with their patient:

# GET NECK PILLOW

When you go to drop off exam sheet; stop by the sterilization area to start warming your patient's neck pillow: Put the pillow inside a clean sleeve, and place it in the microwave for 2 min in microwave. The microwave is located in the sterilization area.

Systems 28
---
# PERFORM PROPHY

Next complete all the hygiene treatment scheduled. Be thorough, but always try to keep the patient comfortable and be EXTREMELY GENTLE! A rough prophy may cause patients to decline further dental treatments. Be sure to inform sensitive or anxious patients of our such as topical anesthesia or the option of nitrous oxide to make them more relaxed and comfortable. During this time it is likely the Doctor will enter to complete the dental exam. When the DDS enters the room he/she will place their hand on your shoulder to let you know he/she is ready. Return the chair to a seated position and introduce the DDS to the patient:

All patients should receive a prophy on their first visit with the hygienist: If it turns out that the patient has periodontal disease, they should be treatment planned for "Gum Infection Therapy" (scaling and root planning): NEVER should anyone refer to scaling as a "Deep Cleaning!" If a patient needs Gum Infection Therapy, then we still perform a prophy (supragingival only) on their first visit, and treatment plan them for Gum Infection Therapy:

Systems 29
---
# PERFORM SEALANTS AND FLUORIDE

We provide treatment plan to all patients for sealants on molars, as well as topical fluoride treatment, no matter what the age. If not covered by insurance, then sealants cost approx. $25 each, and fluoride costs approx. $20. We must review these costs with patients before performing this treatment: If the patient agrees, then perform the treatment: Complete it in the chart; and make sure you inform the treatment coordinator that the patient will need to pay that day: If patients are covered 100% by their insurance, then they will not need to stop and pay with the treatment coordinator.

To check insurance coverage for sealants and prophies, click on FAMILY, double click in the patient's INSURANCE SECTION, and review the INSURANCE NOTES.

# RECORD NEEDED TREATMENT AND PRIORITY

As the Doctor performs the dental exam, needed treatment will be called out and needs to be recorded at that time. The patient's chart should be open and the "Entry Status" needs to be changed to "TreatPlan". Again a tooth must be highlighted to add treatment. Select tooth, then surfaces, then procedure. In the needed treatment phase each procedure needs a priority assigned as well. Under 'Diagnosis' there is a drop down menu labeled priority. Click here to mark "URGENT", "COSMETIC" or "PREVENTATIVE".

The dentist will state the priority status after each procedure called. Repeat needed procedures in front of patient and clear with dentist. Treatment plan can also be accessed from far left tool bar. The final step of setting the priority is to select what the dentist wants to do as the next phase of treatment: All treatment to be done next should be labeled as.

# SCHEDULE NEXT RECALL

Every patient should have their recall scheduled before they leave the office: Establish recall and explain to patient the recall is either 3, 4 or 6 months. Inform the patient that all patients schedule their cleaning ahead of time. They will be contacted a few weeks before the appointment: If they need to reschedule it; they can do so at that time.

Click the appointment block and select the "Make/Find Appt" button on the far right tool bar, the pop will show the entire family: Make sure you have the correct patient highlighted and choose the "Schedule Recall" link below. The program will display a date six months out for scheduling: Click another two weeks forward using the display calendar at the top right of the screen. All recall should have a two week padding in case of the need to call ahead for patients to have the option to come in earlier when other patients cancel.

So in summary, regular recall appointments should be scheduled out 6 months and 2 weeks:

# GIVE PATIENT RECALL CARD

Write down the recall time (including AM or PM) and date on the recall cards located in every operatory in the magnetic baskets behind the computer screens. Make sure patient know they have the recall appointment is already set: Double check the times to prevent scheduling errors that would cause patients to be frustrated. Bad organizational skills reflect the whole office including the Doctor and can lead to patient loss.

# GIVE PATIENT HYGIENE SHEET

Fill out "Hygiene Appointment Assessment" sheet: Include the procedures done and the analysis of patient's oral health: Give this to the patient so they can review recommendations and needed changes in home care.

# GIVE PATIENT THE HYGIENE GOODIE BAG

Every patient should be given a hygiene kit with a toothbrush, toothpaste and floss: We have kid-specific toothbrushes, toothpaste, and floss as well:

Systems 39
---
# INTRODUCE PATIENT TO TREATMENT COORDINATOR

Explain to the patient that the Treatment Coordinator will print out the needed treatment as well as explain insurance coverage: Don't let the patient hold up the doctor with insurance questions. Politely inform them that they will be able to sit down with the coordinator and have everything explained to them. Call the treatment coordinator by name, and tell the patient that you are going to bring her/him right away: Introduce the patient to the coordinator: The Treatment Coordinator is to present finances to patients for Phase 1 care only: This financial presentation is to be performed in the operatory, unless that operatory must be quickly turned over for the next hygiene patient: In that case, the patient is to be walked to the front office to speak with the treatment coordinator.

# REPEAT URGENCY STATEMENT

The "Urgency Statement" should be repeated throughout the appointment time. The patient's concern usually reflects this: Although this can be a different concern that the Doctor has pointed out as the problem needing to be addressed immediately: The patient should feel that as professional clinicians, the recommendation to have treatment is not frivolous. Instead the statement should be taken seriously, repeated, and presented to the patient in a way that also shows personal concern. When the DDS makes the diagnosis and states it needs to be scheduled right away, respond that you will make sure that it gets done. When the patient is introduced to the treatment coordinator repeat this urgency statement out loud:

"Dr. Ganesh wants to see Mr. Jones today or tomorrow for this crown: He said to move a patient if you have to. He doesn't want the tooth breaking in half over the weekend."

Systems 40
---
# TURN OVER ROOM

After the patient has been dismissed, the operatory may be broken down and set up. Replace all instruments in the cassette before transporting them to the sterilization area. Do not walk through the office with loose instruments. Dispose of all trash and take biohazardous material to the sterilization area for disposal in the biohazard bag: Sharps may be thrown away in the sharps container under the desk in each operatory. Use wipes and spray to clean tray, table, air/water syringe etc. Spray, wipe, spray. Allow cavicide to sit on surfaces for maximum virucide. Do not spray cavicide directly on dental chairs; use only the wipes to prevent cracking and discoloration. Spray two pumps of cavicide directly into suction while running to eliminate biofilm between patients.

# HYGIENE MONTHLY CHECKLIST

Besides treating patients, hygienists (and all other staff) have specific duties to perform everyday, every week, and every month: This is listed on the Monthly Checklist: In the following pages, we will describe exactly how to perform each item:

# Hygienist: Monthly Checklist

# SHARPEN INSTRUMENTS AND REPLACE AS NEEDED (Monthly)

Instruments will become dulled with use and sterilization. Efficiency for the hygienist and comfort for the patient can be increased if sharpening is done during down times. Once per month, hygienists are to open all hygiene cassettes to make sure they are complete. Then, they are to sharpen all instruments using the SideKick sharpener.

# ORDER SUPPLIES (Weekly)

The hygienist is charge of ordering the needed supplies (front office and dental) every week. There is a checklist of regularly ordered supplies: Use this list to submit the needed supplies to the main office every Monday morning:

The lab will be stocked with the necessary supplies. Every orderable item is to be separated into spots on the shelves, separated by blue painter's tape and labeled:

Before placing an order, all "Overstock Supplies" located on the top shelf should be moved down into the proper places on the shelves and bins. Only after you have "purged overstock" should you then fill out your order form and place an order.

Systems 43
---
# RESTOCK HYGIENE OPERATORIES (Daily)

Hygiene materials in the plastic cases, located in every operatory on the desk, should be restocked at the end of everyday: These plastic cases should be cleanly organized and filled. The only items to be placed in these cases are the ones labeled:

Systems 44
---
# POST OP CALLS (Daily)

All Gum Infection Therapy (scaling) patients should be contacted at the end of the day for follow-up: Ensure patient that brushing and flossing is comfortable. In the case of Arestin placement; restate that NO flossing should take place in the treated area for TEN days: Ask how patient is doing and address any concerns.

# WALKTHROUGH (Daily)

At the beginning of the day, and right after lunch, the hygienist should walk the office. Check the floor for material that needs to be picked up or thrown away: Also check every light for burned out bulbs. This is your office and your patients are treated here, and the overall state of the office represents you as a clinician. Do not let patients see it as sloppy or disorganized: The hygienist is primarily responsible for these items.

# CLEAN AND ARRANGE OPERATORIES (Daily)

Check the hygiene ops for mess or disorganization. Make sure any dental materials the dentist may have used during an exam is cleaned and moved back to its proper place. Remove all clutter from the desk; and place remotes and keyboard on Velcro pad located on right side of desk: Take out trash if necessary. Do not allow it to become overflowed during the day.

# MAINTAIN BREAKROOM (Daily)

After lunch hour, while the first hygiene patient is being seated, tidy up the breakroom. Rinse and dry any dishes left in the sink, and discard any trash. Quickly wipe down the table. Other employees should be responsible for their own lunch items, anything left for a period of time will be discarded. But it is ultimately the hygienist's responsibility to make sure the breakroom is perfectly clean and organized.

# FLUSH LINES (Daily)

The first thing needed to be done every morning is flushing the lines. Biofilm quickly develops in suction lines and coats the inner lining when allowed to sit overnight. This bacterium can be brought back up thru the negative pressure when a patient closes their mouth on the suction. Use the air/water syringe and run the water directly into the low speed suction, do this for two minutes.

# Auditing Notes

Audits are the most efficient way to maintain healthy business systems!

- No Audits = No GA
- No Audits = Erosion of
- No Audits = No Audits give V_ie 4n4 4zoand Lnss
- Audits give information and evidence important for nys
- Audits place importance on Akm

# Two important types of audits:

- Office Walkthrough ensures facility and daily systems are healthy:
- Chart Audit ensures financial and clinical details are correct and addresses.

Complete the Office Walkthrough once per Aal

Complete the Chart Audit on 2 patients per day, at the minimum:

# Auditing Implementation

Use or create forms, such as the ones on the following page:

If you assign the auditing task to an office manager, make sure you review and act on every audit she performs:

Store copies of these audits in employee files if they fail sections of it. This will serve as evidence for termination, as well as material to review during their 6-month employment evaluations.

# Qutsource Missed Overflow Calls

Dental offices can cut their missed call rates by 97% or more if the practice outsources their missed calls to Front Desk DDS virtual schedulers: When a patient calls, the practice can be "first in line" to answer the phone. If the practice misses the call, Front Desk DDS can be "last in line" to answer that call, before the patient is sent to voicemail:

| |Virtual Scheduler|Voicemail|
|---|---|---|
|Dental Office Staff| | |

If a practice misses 40% of their calls and sees 50 new patients per month, then after adding Breakaway Practice Virtual Schedulers to the phone system, the practice could improve to the following numbers:

|Before Qutsourcing|After Outsourcing|

# Insurance Outsourcing: Is it Right for Your Office?

Insurance is one of the biggest headaches in the office and can be the cause of much stress and anxiety for the front office team:

# What you need to know about insurance outsourcing and what happens when you get started.

When we decided to outsource, we were weighing the cost compared to keeping it in house: Here is how we justified it. We looked at it like the cost of an additional employee but without the additional cost associated with an employee. We did not have to cover sick time; insurance, vacation, handling their time off, or employment taxes. The result was completely freeing up our existing team to handle patients' issues, the schedule, treatment presentations and each of the key components we do to build a thriving office, and let the new company handle all of the insurance:

What's changed? Our outstanding insurance claims have gone down and our collections have gone fast, up. Because outsourced insurance is paid as percent of collections, they are not only motivated to get claims paid but they also know when it makes the most sense to fight a claim they should have paid or should have paid more: They understand the ins and outs of insurance entirely and ensure we are getting paid when and as much as we are owed. They oversee the claims we submit and verify the codes are correct and when items are returned that need more they email us to get more information or a narrative from our doctors to get to the insurance company.

You will have representatives supporting your office and detailed how you want write-offs handled and how you want coverage books updated when you receive payment. The representatives should be your go-to for any insurance questions so your team no longer has to guess they can get a real answer from your outsourced vendor because they research it and find out what you need to know:

# 4 Reasons Suggest Outsourcing Your Dental Insurance

1. Control for you: As you know, embezzlement in our industry is an issue and, in my opinion, outsourcing this part of the dental office is one step toward protecting us and our interests. I know this does not guarantee we won't experience embezzlement; but having someone outside the office handling the insurance money without physically touching the check seems to diminish temptation. It keeps the team honest because they are aware there is a third party that watches the insurance claims going out and the checks coming in, so there is an increased chance of someone catching anything suspicious going on.

# FRONT OFFICE ROCKS

# The Leader in Dental Front Office Solutions & Training

1) More focus from the team: Dental employees sucked into the insurance game and many times can't get out: get on the phones and spend hours with insurance companies, which is not fun and many times, can frustrate the team and that attitude projects to the patients. I prefer to keep my team off the phone with the insurance companies as much as possible, so I can keep them focused on what is important and not bring the office morale down.

2) The company getting paid based off what the insurance pays. And how quickly the insurance pays which is motivation to get the claims paid at the highest amount possible and as quickly as possible: An employee gets paid regardless of whether the office gets paid or not: This fact is what keeps our outstanding insurance claims down since we have switched to outsourcing.

3) They are our insurance experts for my team. This was not one of the reasons I initially decided to outsource, but has definitely become a benefit: They know plans better than anyone so with a quick email to our representatives, they can get a reliable answer to most of their insurance questions, without ever having to call the insurance company themselves: Just on a side note, have you called an insurance company lately? I called Delta last Tuesday and the recording told me that I would be on hold for 47 minutes... talk about a waste of productivity and money!

I realize that outsourcing can be costly, but so can hiring and retaining a full-time employee or dedicating hours of each day to handling insurance claims and issues with insurance companies: It may not be a fit for every office, but it has worked for us and continues to benefit our office and staff in new ways.

I understand that this estimate is NOT a guarantee of payment by my insurance. If the insurance company pays more, I will receive a refund. If the insurance company pays less, I will receive a bill for the difference or have my payment plan extended.

Proper and extensive financial training is imperative to a dentist and dental office; without it, the office does not get paid. Whether you take insurance or not, talking with the patients about money and getting them to pay is not always the easiest part of the day: Financial Presentation takes someone who is well-trained, confident, and understands that at the end of the day, if the office does not get paid. As soon as the patient leaves the office, your opportunity to close them and schedule treatment goes down dramatically: Learn the ins and outs of financial presentations.

# INFILTRATIONS

These injections to the apex of the mouth are most often used for minor surgical and dental procedures. So, it is always useful to have the DentalVibe in the palm of your hand.

# Uttrate Injection Comfort

# PALATAL

DentalVibe's distraction is important because the density of palatal soft tissues and their adherence to the bone make these injections particularly uncomfortable.

# MANDIBULAR BLOCK

DentalVibe is necessary to help keep discomfort levels to a minimum. Over a longer period, as the slow injection technique is most often used.

# Exam Sheet

Communicates to the dentist what the patient may need:

Saves the dentist 10min-15min of time:

Provides for a second set of eyes looking at the patients.

# When does the hygienist give the exam sheet to the dentist?

# When should a dentist perform an exam?

This keeps hygiene running on time:

This allows the dentist to finish tough cases before having to leave for an exam:

Because hygienists run on time, they don't feel the need to skip sealants, fluoride, or patient education in order to catch up in their schedules.

# Phasing Treatment

New patients are the worst patients! They have case acceptance and no-show rates.

# Why?

Three phasing options for presenting financials and treatment:

- Present finances for the entire treatment plan: Low case acceptance.
- Present finances for the next appointment only: High case acceptance; Low production.
- Present a chunk of treatment as Phase I: Moderate-to-high case acceptance; High production per new patient.

# Types of New Patients

- Chief Complainer
- Ready for treatment:
- - Phase I:

Procrastinator
- They've been putting off the work: They know they need treatment:
- - Phase I

Clueless Patient
- Everything is fine. Nothing hurts.

# Clinical Presentation 5

# Building Urgency and Increasing Same-Day Dentistry

# HYGIENIST

Take an intraoral image of the Chief Complaint (or disease/decay):

"I'm not a dentist, but it looks like if Dr. doesn't take care of this soon, it could get a lot worse:"

Measure the gums: "A 4 or greater is a sign that an infection is eating away at your bone."

Laser cavity test: "This laser will make a sound every time it finds a cavity:"

# DENTIST

Build a trusting relationship by finding three things in common with the patient:

Then, "What brings you here today? (Hygienist's name) tells me you have (chief complaint)"

Let the patient tell the entire story - NO INTERRUPTIONS.

"We need to take care of this today!"

Perform the exam and chart all needed treatment.

Call off the treatment to your hygienist/assistant in language the patient understands:

"The top right tooth in the back has a cavity eating away all around it - #2-MOD."

Categorize the treatment as Urgent, Preventative, and Cosmetic.

Present treatment, spending all effort talking about the consequences and problems:

Only discuss the solution after the patient asks for it, and only use one sentence.

Review the treatment plan in the chart, and label all appropriate treatment as Phase I.

'(Hygienist's name), please tell (Tx Coord Name) that we need to start this today or tomorrow - move a patient if you have to - because I don't want these teeth breaking in half."

# HANDOFF

"Dr. wants to see Ms. Jones in his schedule today or tomorrow, because he doesn't want these teeth breaking in half over the weekend: Move a patient if you have to."

# TX COORD

Present finances in the operatory if possible - and only present Phase treatment:

"Ok, Dr. wants to start this right away before the teeth break in half, so let me go over this with you;"

When presenting options for treatment; present the ideal option first.

Then with any other options, explain what benefits the patient will be "LOSING."

The team relies on a full and accurate schedule each day: Dental office scheduling includes more than understanding how to schedule a patient. A deeper understanding of scheduling includes its various components, such as how to get patients to schedule and actually show up for their appointments, handling cancellations and managing both the doctor and hygiene schedules. The schedule is the backbone of the entire office: Let's build a productive and well-run schedule (that can handle a few bumps!

---
# Hygienist Pay Structure

# Hourly wage + commission

# Unassisted Hygiene

Weekly production goal = 3.5 x hygienist's weekly salary (taxes and benefits included)

Hygienist receives 15% of all adjusted production beyond weekly goal.

|Hygienist's weekly salary:|$1,000|
|---|---|
|This week's adjusted production:|$4,400|
|3.5 x $1,000 = $3,500 (weekly production goal):| |
|($4,400 - $3,500) x 15% = $135 commission for the week| |

# Assisted Hygiene

Weekly production goal = (3.5 x hygienist's weekly salary) plus the assistant's weekly salary

Hygienist receives 15% of all adjusted production beyond weekly goal:

|Hygienist's weekly salary:|$1,000|
|---|---|
|Assistant's weekly salary:|$500|
|This week's adjusted production:|$5,200|
|(3.5 x $1,000) + $500 = $4,000 (weekly production goal):| |
|($5,200 - $4,000) x 15% = $180 commission for the week| |
---
# Hybrid Compensation

Commission = 15% x (Adjusted Production / Production Goal)

Adjusted Production = all procedures performed except for exams

Production Goal (weekly salary) x 3.5

# Assisted Hygiene

# What is assisted hygiene?

2 operatories

1 hygienist

1 dedicated hygienist assistant

The hygienist performs education and preventative duties, while the assistant seats the patient, performs X-rays, provides a helping hand, and turns over the room.
---
# What is assisted hygiene?

Hygienist gets her own assistant NOT to be shared with the doctor!

Hygienist has plenty of cavitron tips and sharp instruments.

Hygienist does NOT perform a faster prophy or rush through treatment!

The hygienist assistant is constantly and immediately available to the hygienist.

# New Patient Appointment

|20 min|Assistant seats patient; takes BP and records; takes X-rays.|
|---|---|
|50 min|Hygienist performs full mouth probing; intraoral images, diagnodent readings, educates patient, and performs prophy. Assistant helps when needed for charting.|

# Hygiene Capacity

Hygiene Schedule is Too Booked

New patients and SCRP patients have to wait at least two weeks to be seen: Its been that way on a consistent basis for a few months:

# Is the restorative schedule too booked?

|YES|We must either expand the capacity to accommodate the high demand: or we must shrink the demand:|
|---|---|
| |Expand the office hours to accommodate the high demand:|
| |Expand the facility to build out more total ops.|
| |Hire an associate to take on the additional demand.|
|NO|Drop the lowest paying insurance plans, or raise fees.|
| |Stop doing inefficient non-profitable procedures:|

# We need to expand hygiene capacity: Do we have extra ops for this?

|YES|Hire another hygienist, or go to Assisted Hygiene:|
|---|---|
|NO|Expand the hygiene office hours to accommodate more hygiene patients.|
| |Expand the physical facility to build out more hygiene ops:|

I understand that the amount due is my responsibility and that insurance is billed as a courtesy to assist me in paying my obligation. I understand that insurance figures provided are estimates only. I understand that this estimate is NOT a guarantee of payment by my insurance. If the insurance company pays more, I will receive a refund. If the insurance company pays less, I will receive a bill for the difference or have my payment plan extended. I understand that if my insurance company fails to pay within 60 days of the claim being submitted, the full amount due is my responsibility. I understand that the above estimated fees are based on my treatment plan as listed above. The treatment plan may change, altering the total cost of care. I understand I will be charged a $40 cancellation fee if I cancel an appointment later than 10 am the previous business day.
