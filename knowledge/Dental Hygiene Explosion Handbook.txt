"HERE'S TO THE CRAZY ONES, THE MISFITS, THE REBELS, THE TROUBLEMAKERS, THE ROUND PEGS IN THE SQUARE HOLES. THE ONES WHO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. THEY'RE NOT FOND OF RULES, AND THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE STATUS QUO. YOU CAN QUOTE THEM, DISAGREE WITH THEM, GLORIFY OR VILIFY THEM, BUT THE ONLY THING YOU CAN'T DO IS IGNORE THEM BECAUSE THEY CHANGE THINGS." -STEVE JOBS

Patients deserve the very best we can give them.

Most dentists want more than an average hygienist, they want a highly productive hygienist!

# YOUR PATIENTS NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET

# What tools do we have to help them?

# FLUORIDE BENEFITS

- CRA studies show Up to 75% reduction in new decay
- Helps prevent cervical decay
- Reduces sensitivity
- Prolongs life of crowns and other restorations
- Tastes better; treatment is shorter than it used to be

# KNOWLEDGE VS: MASTERY

# What does your report say?

# FLUORIDE

Fluoride treatment should be completed on all patients every 3-6 months.

In-office fluoride benefits all ages.

Do you provide a professional strength Topical Fluoride to every patient who gets their teeth polished?

Varnish provides a more effective benefit than other in-office alternatives.

# WHO SHOULD HAVE SEALANTS?

'Everyone has a 95 percent chance of eventually experiencing caries in the pits and fissures of their teeth, if sealants are not used in those areas.'

ADA council on Dental therapeutics

# ADA STATES:

The application of dental sealants is an extremely simple procedure to perform and does not cause any discomfort for the patient. Because of their simplicity and effectiveness; from a health standpoint; sealants make excellent sense for both children and adults:

# HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SEALANTS?

Due to high rates of sealants failures in the past, we find some dentists not actively advocating sealants in their practice; Sealants of today have dramatically improved over past products; and see a 98% retention rate.

Now with Fluoride release, sealants have staged a powerful comeback.

# IN COMBINATION WITH FLUORIDE, THE ROUTINE AND AGGRESSIVE USE OF SEALANTS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ERADICATE PIT AND FISSURE CARIES IN CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS

# WHEN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

# AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH HELD A CONFERENCE ON DENTAL SEALANTS, THE CONSENSUS REVEALED THE EXPECTED DANGER FROM SEALING UNDETECTABLE CARIES MAY ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING THE CARIES PROCESS:

National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference statement on dental sealants Mertz-Fairhurst EJ; Schuster GS, Williams JE. Fairhurst CWV Clinical progress of sealed and unsealed caries Part Depth changes & bacterial counts: Prosthet Dent: 979, 42.521-526,

# “INDIVIDUALS 4 YEARS AND OLDER, FOR EXAMPLE; ARE OFTEN ON MEDICATIONS THAT CAUSE SYSTEMIC AND ORAL COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING XEROSTOMIA WHICH MAY INCREASE CARIES RISK”

DENTAL SEALANTS CAN INHIBIT THE ADVANCEMENT OF CARIES IN MANY OF THESE CASES, AND MAY BE THE TREATMENT OF CHOICE FOR BORDERLINE CARIOUS LESIONS;

# U, BotaMA

This in vitro polarized light microscopic study evaluated the caries protective effect of 4 low viscosity fluoride-releasing pit and fissure sealants in primary teeth. 10 extracted or exfoliated primary teeth with caries free buccal and lingual surfaces underwent tissue debridement and fluoride-free prophylaxis. Specimens were sectioned into tooth halves to allow for a paired-tooth design. Cavity preparations were placed in buccal and lingual surfaces. Buccal cavities were filled with fluoride-releasing sealant (CS-F, Conseal F, SDI), while lingual cavities were filled with sealant lacking fluoride (CS, Conseal Light Grey, SDI). Acid-resistant varnish was applied leaving minimum surface contact and the sealant exposed. After thermocycling, artificial caries were formed (2.5mM Ca, 2.5mM PO4, 50mM acetic acid, 0.5ppm fluoride, pH 3.90). After lesion initiation and progression periods, sections (1 tooth half) were taken and linear surface lesion depths and wall lesion frequencies were determined using polarized light;

|CS#|Mean Depth|Wall Lesions|Wall Lesions|
|---|---|---|---|
|152+1um|127|193+27um|22*6|
|223+2um|16%|349+4um|287:|

Fluoride-release from pit and fissure sealants provided protective effect against a constant cariogenic challenge for the adjacent surface enamel following lesion initiation and progression. Similar caries resistance along the sealant-cavity surface interface was found with either fluoride-releasing or non-fluoride containing sealants.

David Gore, DMD, Division of Restorative Dentistry and Prosthodontics at the University of Kentucky 20/

# HOW LONG DO THEY LAST?

"Research shows that the application of sealants in suspect fissures is advisable for adults with high caries risk. Sealant placement and the use of fluoride are the pinnacles of a highly effective caries prevention program, but sealant use among adults represents an underutilized preventive strategy."

-DR DAVID GORE

# SEALANTS

In a longevity study by Simonsen, it was revealed that a one-time application of sealants was responsible for reducing caries by 52% during a 15-year period. In a study of military recruits, the use of dental sealants tripled over a 4-year period, which resulted in a significant decrease in one surface restorations.

Many oral health care providers worry about inadvertently placing sealants over incipient carious lesions because of the risk that caries could progress. Studies show that, when sealed, radiographically evident caries did not progress over a 10-year period.

~Briley JB, Mertz-Fairhurst EJ: Radiographic analysis of previously sealed carious teeth Dent Res: 1994, 73.416.

Recommend sealants on all posterior teeth. Do not focus on only teeth that insurance will pay for.

# SEALANTS

# SAME DAY SEALANTS

When possible place sealants the same day diagnosis

GOAL: Complete sealant procedures without having to re-appoint patients

"Today's busy patients demand convenience and accessibility" ~Dentistry IQ 2013

Appointing same- or next-day could improve show-up rates in the average practice by 56%

If we are accepting reduced fee insurance plans, we MUST offer same day preventive procedures to remain profitable - the NEXT dollar principle

# YEAH: BUT

This sounds good, but what happens when

Sealant set ups in each operatory

Easy access to curing light

Begin discussion with parent at the beginning of the appointment

Streamline communication with radios

Have teeth with potential pre-screened with Cavity Detecting laser if possible
---
"The DIAGNOdent is a valuable adjunct to caries detection and worthy of purchase" ~Gordon Christensen

# TREATMENT PLANNING FOR PREDICTABILITY

Communicate the Practice Standard Protocol, and STICK to it

# Example System:

|Reading of 0-20|Elective Sealant Recommended, Completed Same Day|
|---|---|
|20-30|Preventive Resin Treatment Planned|
|30+|Most likely a cavity|
|IF questionable, have handpiece and burr set up for a quick groove clean out|IF questionable, have handpiece and burr set up for a quick groove clean out|

# DISCUSSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELECTIVE PROCEDURES

WILL ADULT PATIENTS REALLY ACCEPT SEALANTS?

Wow Wendy;

So this rocks my world right now. Yesterday I implemented fluoride, sealants, X-rays and WFL - I did 24 sealants on adult teeth; 2 fluorides (I only had 4 adults because it was a kids day) and a couple extra X-rays signed up someone for White for life. Well get this - my production yesterday was 2,187. That absolutely made me so happy! Today has been amazing so far 35 well! I am so grateful for all you have shown us! I am watching in the trenches and was curious about the periolase; Is that on the website?

# 8 TEETH NEED SEALANTS

4 are Pre-molar; 4 are Molars;

We often hear: "Your insurance covers molars at 100%, pre-molars at zero."

So the parent says: "Just do the ones that are covered."

90 DAYS SAME AS CASH

Know you probably weren't planning on this today. We can break this up into smaller bite-sized pieces if that helps. If you can take care of $70 today; we can go ahead and get these done while you are here:

# INSTEAD: DISCUSS TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT, THEN WHAT INSURANCE WILL COVER

Total cost to protect these 8 teeth will be $400, it looks like your insurance company will help you pay for about $200 of that. That leaves $200 as your portion; let's talk about your options.

90 DAYS SAME AS CASH

Check with your merchant account; they can often set up payment plans utilizing credit card/debit card. Make sure you have payment information in advance, so we aren't chasing it down.

Radiograph recommendations were updated by the ADA in 2005

How are we doing with implementing these changes?

In 2002, the American Dental Association; recognizing that dental technology and science continually advance, recommended to the FDA that the guidelines be reviewed for possible updating:

The FDA welcomed organized dentistry's interest in maintaining the guidelines, and so the American Dental Association undertook this review.

# FACTORS INCREASING RISK

# NEW ADA GUIDELINES FOR PRESCRIBING DENTAL RADIOGRAPHS IN 2005

The development and progress of many oral conditions are associated with a patient's age, stage of dental development; and vulnerability to known risk factors:

1. High level of caries experience or demineralization
2. History of recurrent caries
3. High titers of cariogenic bacteria
4. Existing restoration(s) of poor quality
5. Poor oral hygiene
6. Inadequate fluoride exposure
7. Prolonged nursing (bottle or breast)
8. Frequent high sucrose content in diet
9. Poor family dental health
10. Xerostomia
11. Developmental or acquired disability
12. Genetic abnormality of teeth
13. Many multi-surface restorations
14. Chemoradiation therapy
15. Eating disorders
16. Drug/alcohol abuse
17. Irregular dental care

# RADIOGRAPHS ARE JUSTIFIED EVERY MONTHS FOR THOSE WHO:

- Have a history of decay
- Have history of Endo
- Have history of Perio
- Have evidence of Bone loss
- Have systemic conditions that may affect oral health
- Have restorations

# ADA RISK FACTORS FOR DECAY

|Risk Level|Risk Factors|
|---|---|
|Low RISK|Multi-surface restorations|
|Moderate RISK|Cariogenic diet|
| |Open margins|
| |Prolonged nursing (bottle or breast)|
| |Active orthodontic treatment|
| |Physical & mental disability|
| |Poor family dental health|
| |Developmental or acquired enamel defects|
| |Poor oral hygiene|
| |Eating disorders|

# DENTAL X-RAYS IN THE NEWS

April 10, 2012 Media stories regarding Dental X-rays dominated the news. Study in Cancer claims Dental X-rays are linked to brain tumors. If you watched the story or listened to the media, you might walk away with the message that Dental X-rays are bad. ADA and AGD released statements about the flaws in the study.

# SAFE LEVEL OF RADIATION EXPOSURE?

American Nuclear Society says that the average radiation level per person per year is 620 millirems (mrems) per year. Safe allowable dose for nuclear plant workers; or those exposed to radiation in their work is 5,000 mrems per year.

# EXAMPLES OF COMMON DOSAGES OF RADIATION

|2 hours in a jet plane|mrem|
|---|---|
|Living in a stone or adobe house|mrem per year|
|Pack of cigarettes each day|36-1500 mrem per year|
|Chest CT scan|700 mrem|
|Whole body CT scan|1000 mrem|
|Bitewing or PA dental x-ray|mrem (conventional)|
|Digital X-rays|even less radiation!|

# ANOTHER KEY CHANGE TO ADA GUIDELINES IN 2005:

# What is recommended?

"OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES" Including but not limited to; proposed or existing implants, pathology, restorative/endodontic needs, treated periodontal disease and caries remineralization

# FOR HIGH RISK PATIENTS:

CONSIDER ALTERNATING BITEWINGS WITH ANTERIOR PA'S

Insurance limitations are changing; be aware!

Utilize CAMBRA codes in attempt to minimize insurance non-payment of PA's

# Anterior PA's

- All treatment planned crowns
- Follow up Post-endodontic treatment per year
- Follow up Post-implant procedures per year

# THE VALUE OF A SMILE

# GIVING PATIENTS A REASON TO COME BACK

Our version of rewards points, air miles, frequent shopper cards, something your patients want!

American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry survey:

- Virtually all adults (99.7%) believe a smile is an important social asset.
- 96% of adults believe an attractive smile makes a person more appealing to members of the opposite sex.
- Three-quarters (74%) of adults feel an unattractive smile can hurt a person's chance for career success.

# WHITENING!

And when respondents were asked, "What would you like to improve most about your smile?" The most common response was.

# WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF ENROLLMENT?

- Patients agree to stay current on recall.
- Give you 24 hours notice before cancelling or changing an appointment.

PATIENTS HAVE A REASON TO KEEP THEIR APPOINTMENTS!

They want their complimentary gel.

They ask for it when they come in.

Everyone on the team needs to know who is enrolled in WFL.

# STEP SEVEN

Start enrolling patients!
---
# WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THEY CALL AND TRY TO CANCEL THEIR APPOINTMENT?

We need to be able to see at a glance that they are enrolled. Remind them of their benefits!

# What happens when the patient misses their appointment?

Is it a true emergency? 'just this once

Waive the re-enrollment fee.

# What is the re-enrollment fee?

$15 for today's touch up, automatically re-enrolled.

# OTHER TIPS

Have Recall Cards made that remind patients of their WFL benefits.

Let them know at confirmation call that we will have their touch up kit waiting for them.

# INCLUDED IN THE WHITENING FOR LIFE PROGRAM

ARE TECHNIQUES WE HAVE DEVELOPED TO REDUCE OVERHEAD DRASTICALLY!

Your overhead per patient enrolled is under $/2 with traditional custom trays.

Sheer White ranges from $/5-$8 but no time or impression material, stone, resin sheets; bleaching gel etc.

# STREAMLINING

# RECALL = Patients who are Due for their Hygiene Visits

# RECOVERY

# HYGIENE COORDINATOR

For larger practices we strongly recommend one Go-TO person oversee keeping the hygiene schedule full

- Knows strategies to win the battle
- Feels the urgency in crisis situations
- Main Recruiter. Directs the troops

The Team Member in charge of Recall, Recovery and Re-Activation Strategies

# EVERY PATIENT LEAVES WITH AN APPOINTMENT

Your dialogue should be smooth enough to convince every patient that this is the best way to ensure future health. Ideally scheduled by the hygiene team. What do we say to those who "just want a card"?

# 3 THE SILVER BULLET FOR RECALL

# ONE WEEK CALLS

ONE WEEK AHEAD courtesy call for any patients who have been scheduled 3-6 MONTHS previously and have not confirmed via text or email. Confirmation call day before will still happen. Tell them you will be calling so they expect this phone call to minimize complaints. Email/text confirmation programs are extremely helpful, but they DO NOT replace what we are doing - if they don't confirm by automated system, we need to make the call.

# 2 RECALL CARDS MAILED

Send self-addressed cards 2-3 weeks ahead. Updated cards that send a good message. Many went away from cards, in lieu of technology, but we are seeing a return to the cards as they function in a larger system of contacting patients and are more effective.

# 4 GIVING PATIENTS A REASON TO COME BACK

Whitening for Life - program. Patient Retention Programs in place. Offer this to everyone! Once patients are enrolled; be sure to enter WFL into continuing care and/or the patient's account the flag.

# PATIENT RETENTION

Serve your patients well when they are here

The YESI Philosophy is it really all about the patient in your practice or is it really all about you?

65% of your patients leave because of perceived service problems

# 3 ROLES FOR THE WORLD

# PERIODONTAL THERAPIST

# CLASS DENTAL HYGIENIST

# Periodontal Therapist

Have you run any audits lately to analyze how well things are going with Periodontal Services in your practice?

What is your acceptance rate for Periodontal Services?

Are you treating Periodontal Disease the same old, same old way or have You made adjustments to your protocols based on the latest science?

# DID YOU KNOW

# ORAL SYSTEMIC LINK

BLEEDING GUMS CAN BE A KEY EARLY-WARNING SIGN FOR OVER 20 SERIOUS MEDICAL DISORDERS, INCLUDING DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND CANCERS OF THE COLON AND OTHER ORGANS:

# BIOFILM DISEASES

When bacteria succeed in forming a biofilm in the human host; the infection often becomes untreatable and develops into a chronic state.

# Chronic Ear infections

# Pneumonia in cystic fibrosis

# Diabetic foot lesions; chronic wounds

Affect millions of people, and cause many deaths.

# BIOFILM BACTERIA

Once inside Biofilm; the cells become more resistant to the body's natural antimicrobials.

Resistant to anti-biotics.

Over-use of anti-biotics and anti-microbials have contributed to the development of Super Bacteria.

# SCALING AND ROOT PLANING

If all we do is its like mowing this lawn and expecting improvement.

Bacterial levels return to pre-treatment levels within 21-60 days after scaling and root planing.

# 3 LEVELS OF CARE

- Preventive Oral Prophylaxis
- Therapeutic Scaling and Root Planing
- Supportive Periodontal Maintenance

# WHEN DO WE BILL

Obviously right after active therapy; but what after the condition has stabilized?

# 3 LEVELS OF CARE

- Preventive Oral Prophylaxis
- Therapeutic Scaling and Root Planing
- Supportive Periodontal Maintenance

# PROPHY OR PERIO MAINTENANCE?

Insurance companies might suggest you alternate these codes to get higher reimbursement.
---
# PERIODONTAL MAINTENANCE

For patients who have previously been treated for Periodontal Disease: Typically Maintenance starts after completion of active therapy and continues for the life of the dentition.

“DIO AND D49|0 ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE ALTERNATED”

ADA Benefits Office January 2006

# “IT WOULD NEVER BE APPROPRIATE TO ALTERNATE THEM”

THE FINAL SAY:

“Knowingly alternating DIO and D49|0 to maximize insurance benefits would constitute fraud: We must code for the procedure being performed: Otherwise the Attorney General could make a convincing case for prosecution”

# 3 STEPS TO FLUORIDE SUCCESS

# FLUORIDE PROTOCOL

# Step 1:

NEW RESEARCH SHOWS decay by up:

# Step 2:

Here's why fluoride would be good for you today

# Step 3:

Bad news; Insurance won't help with cost

|Risk Assessment|Survey:|
|---|---|
|Are they at high risk for decay?| |

Fluoride Varnish 80% more effective; Nupro White 2 hours

Our patients need all the help they can get! Strongly recommend this valuable service to your patients

Listen for verbal cues Earlier you mentioned..let's talk about a solution

Help them see it's $ a great investment

# SEALANT PROCESS

Use Diagnodent and Camera:

We have 2 choices:

1. Wait until cavity
2. Prevent cavity

Use radios!

Sealants on all #icorteeth

# New Research Shows:

Same Day sealant potential identified; Doctor will perform exam as soon as possible, next natural break.

ADA recommends this for children and adults.

Cost of sealant often less than Co-pay for a filling.

Reduce cavities by 70%.

# 90 Days Teamwork!

All teeth that would benefit from sealants discussed as elective service.

Focus on what SAME DAY Insurance WILL pay, not what they don't cover.

Talk about sealants in total dollar amount.

# SetUps in Each Treatment Room

If possible, would you like this done today?

'Individuals 40 years and older are often on medications that cause systemic and oral complications including xerostomia which may increase caries risk. Dental sealants can inhibit the advancement of caries in many of these cases, and may be the treatment of choice for borderline carious lesions; David Gore, DMD, Division of Restorative Dentistry and Prosthodontics at the University of Kentucky, 2011.

# DE-SENSITIZING PROCESS

# NO PAY GUARANTEE

"Let's do this, we can try it on your most sensitive tooth: If it doesn't work, you don't pay: If it does, it's only $29"

# BEST TECHNIQUE

Apply one coat, thin stream of air, then light cure. Apply second coat.

# THE TEAM TRAINING INSTITUTE

# HOW LONG DOES IT LAST?

Lasts up to three years. "If you start to notice the sensitivity creeping back, most likely you have had more recession in the area."

# PAY ATTENTION!

Many patients need more than fluoride alone to reduce their sensitivity. Seal and Protect also proven to reduce future damage from toothbrush abrasion.

# ADVANCED ORAL CANCER Screening

One American dies every hour of every day from Oral Cancer.

# BUIDIGVALUE

No longer good enough to focus on traditional High-Risk profiles.

90% of all Oral Cancer is curable if detected early.

# SCREENINGS

NEED SCREENED

HPV has increased risk for young adults.

11 strains of HPV cause Oral Cancer.

"Those infected with HPV were 32 times more likely to develop oral or throat cancers." - New England Journal of Medicine

Educate the patient that this will be done yearly just like other cancer screenings. Some practices might realize higher acceptance by offering a lower fee, and doing the screening at every examination.

# EMBRACE NEW TECHNOLOGY

YEARLY SCREENING IS RECOMMENDED.

Cervical Cancer mortality rates reduced by 75% after advanced screening techniques introduced.

# Set a goal to increase acceptance of Oral Cancer Screenings
