# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Hygiene: a Loss Leader or Untapped Potential?

Too often in dentistry, we hear that hygiene is seen as a loss leader. The average hygienist in the US is producing just $61 per hour or a measly $468 per day. Fortunately, not all hygienists are in a loss-leading position, but it represents the traditional tale in dentistry.

We've been told for years to discount hygiene services and get patients in the door, then sell some sort of restorative solution. This approach says it doesn't matter if hygiene is profitable or productive. It argues that the sole purpose of hygiene is to feed the restorative division of the practice.

# How can we hope to make goal if all we are producing is $61 an hour?

Many experts have drawn to our attention that hygiene is dramatically underutilizing its potential.

For example, international speaker Tom Orent "The Gems Guy" says:"The average hygienist uses only 35% of her potential"

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Many people are telling us we need to make more of our potential but not many are telling us how.

Do you know: Are you maximizing the potential from Hygiene in your practice?

If I'm the hygienist I'm frustrated that I'm being told I'm not maximizing my potential and not truly being as productive as I can be. But nobody is giving me a viable solution on how to become more productive. And that's essential in these crazy economic times!

# Our vision for you

The book Acres of Diamonds tells the story of a farmer in Africa who sold his farm and went in search of wealth and luxury and returned home never having found it, only to discover that the farm he had sold held a diamond mine. That's the Hygiene Diamonds approach to hygiene for practices across the world: We have all this untapped potential beneath our feet: All we are missing is a strategy to turn it into what we want:

- We don't know how to deal with all the patients that are coming in every day
- Stop the no-shows
- Handle the headaches we are having day in and day out

and turn it into something productive and profitable.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Our goal is to take the common tasks you do every day in your hygiene department and turn it into something excellent: Booker T. Washington says, "Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way."

Some of what we cover in the early stages of this program covers basic principles but we approach it in a different way. By doing that, we are going to help you uncover those Acres of Diamonds within your practice.

# What kind of results can you expect?

We hear comments like these all the time from people all over the world about what is possible:

- "We have untapped potential beneath our feet: All we are missing is a strategy to turn it into what we want."
- "We are in a recession."
- "I live in small-town America."
- "I'm in the UK, Canada, Australia."
- "My practice is different."

So I want to share some real results from a small-town dentist in Iowa:

- Up 73% in collections from same month last year
- Hygiene up 46% from previous record month one month after implementing some of the concepts we cover in this course.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Here are some results from a different practice in Canada. Each one of their 17 hygienists made goal both Friday and Saturday. The training was on Thursday so these results were immediately after learning about these concepts. They were able to apply them right away and see great results.

# Instant results can be expected!

Here are more results from another practice that has chosen "not to participate in the recession." The hygiene explosion has been literally "It has been like pouring gasoline on a bonfire."

# Why should we change?

In addition to the financial benefits, there are other compelling reasons we should be willing to look at change:

- Perio malpractice suits are at an all-time high: We have patients suing their dentists for not being aggressive enough in catching, diagnosing and treating their periodontal disease from the very earliest stages. Supervised neglect is no longer an option.
- We need to look at improving our verbal skills and confidence so that we are serving our patients adequately: Patients demand better service.
- We live in a different society; patients are busy. They don't want to take three appointments for something that can be accomplished in one.
- Dentists want more from you. Dentists want more from their hygienists than they were willing to settle for in the past.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# It's a new era for dental hygiene

Most dentists want more than an average hygienist: They want a highly productive hygienist!

That's quite fair for them to request: So how do you become a highly-productive hygienist?

# Here are three roles for the Modern Day Dental Hygienist

- Preventive Therapist
- Periodontal Therapist
- Treatment Advocate

In this module, we focus mainly on the preventive therapist role.

At this stage, you may be asking: 'What's in it for me?"

Everybody has different reasons for taking part in this training maybe you resent having to give up your time for it: Maybe you are excited about it: As you go through the training; you should become even more excited about it and you'll see more personal benefits, including:

- Job security: It's argued there is no job security in today's economy but that doesn't need to be true if you are a highly-productive hygienist: You can create your own job security.
- Highly productive hygienists are in HIGH demand: If you are productive, you will be in high demand in your own practice and with others.

Production-based compensation is a WIN-WIN for everyone:

If you are already compensated based on your production, there are real benefits in improving your production.

If you are currently paid by the hour, we have some approaches that will help you discuss this with your doctor and create a win, win, win for the doctor, the patient and the hygiene team:

Immense satisfaction from being an exceptional practitioner

# Becoming More Productive in Hygiene Tomorrow

Let's look at how you can create a Hygiene Explosion in your practice. In this module, we focus on your role as a Preventive Therapist: We'll cover:

- Treating the infection of decay new research on development of the infection
- Risk Assessment "Are we treating the infection that causes cavities?"
- Fluoride

We'll cover the research on the different approaches: topical, take-home and varnish. We'll also cover specific verbal skills that will help you increase your acceptance rates.

# Are we treating the infection?

We have to make sure we are treating the infection that causes caries. CAMBRA is the research organization that is studying dental caries and decay in depth. We're not going to review the details of what decay is but we'll use their data to review what the latest research is telling us about decay:

We know that dental caries is a pandemic infectious, multi-factorial biofilm disease leading to demineralization, cavitation and ultimately, if untreated, leads to loss of the teeth. But, as a result of the infectious biofilm:

It is the most complex and difficult disease there is to diagnose and treat.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It is the most prevalent childhood disease in the US

So the key is.

# Don't underestimate the Biofilm!

# What happens in the Infection Process?

We have exposure to sucrose (sugar) that leads to increased mutans streptococci activity (ATP).

What happens next is that there is a population shift in the bacteria:

huge shift from harmless bacteria to extremely harmful.

There is a bacteria from &lt; 1% to &gt;96% Ms and Lb, which are acidogenic and cariogenic: They will cause cavities.

At the same time, there is also a pH shift to 4.5-5.0 (4.7) occurs with the population shift.

So, with the pH shift and the population shift; the acidic environment begins to demineralize the enamel.

# Here's what the independent research says:

"Independent research from multiple sites, utilizing reverse checkerboard analysis of DNA sequencing, and population studies have accumulatively identified up to 23 different bacterial species significantly implicated now in the caries process:D)

Kutsch VK, Kutsch CL, Nelson BC. clinical look at CAMBRA: DPR August 2007 . 41(8):62-67 .

In the past we used to do saliva test screening mainly for strep mutans but doing that is missing out on up to 23 species that are involved in the process.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Here's some further research

"Collectively, these studies showed conclusively that it was the low pH generated from sugar metabolism rather than sugar availability that led to the breakdown of microbial homeostasis in dental plaque."

— Marsh PD. Dental plaque as a biofilm and microbial community: implications for health and disease. BMC Oral Health 2006. 6 Suppl: S14.

The key point is that it's the low pH that causes the significant problem.

# How at risk are your patients?

One of the ways to establish the risk to our patients is to look at the pH of their oral environment: The results might be surprising: For example, the chart below shows the pH of some popular beverages.

|PRODUCT|ACID PH|SUGAR per 12 oz|
|---|---|---|
|Pure Water|7.00|Neutral|
|Aquafina and Dasani Water|4.0| |
|Diet Coke|3.39| |
|Red Wine|3.3| |
|Mountain Dew|3.22|11.0 tsp|
|Gatorade|2.95|3.3 tsp|
|Pepsi|2.49|9.8 tsp|
|Coke|2.63|9.3 tsp|

Many people are surprised that bottled water can be so acidic, while other drinks also have high sugar content.

---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The combination of low pH and high sugar content means the enamel just erodes away.

With the addition of these low pH beverages to the oral environment, the bacteria are given extra fuel to do more damage.

Outside the US, there are many other popular beverages and you can usually find out the pH and sugar content with a Google search:

Of course it's not just the beverages that are doing damage. There are other drinks and foods that cause problems. Many people are living on high carb diets.

# The chart below shows the pH of several popular candies.

|SweetTarts|Wonka Nerds|
|---|---|
|X-treme Airheads|3|
|Sour Punch Straws|2.5|
|Starburst|2.4|
|Lemonheads|2.4|
|Mentos Fruit chews|2.4|
|Sour Skittles|2.2|
|Pixy Stick Powder|1.9|
|Altoids Sours|1.9|
|Now and Later|1.9|
|Wonka Fun Dip|1.8|
|Warheads|1.6|
|BATTERY ACID|1.0|

Some of the numbers are very low, some even very close to the acidity of battery acid! These are very popular candies with children so we have our work cut out helping our patients win the battle against chronic infection.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The key point is that: Healthy bacteria cannot survive in an acidic environment but the destructive bacteria can.

# The warning signs

We need to be able to pay attention to warning signs, such as in these photos. Whenever we see issues like this with all the demineralization all along the cervical areas, we know we have an infection that we need to address. In the first one there is extensive demineralization and infection and, in the second, the tissues are also red. There is plaque and biofilm all over the teeth. It becomes our job not just to clean that off but also to address what is causing the level of infection that we are seeing here: We have to pay attention to the warning signs.

With problems like these. Your patients need all the help they can get.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# The Tools We Have To Help Them

Let's look at the tools and products we have available the options we have when we have a patient in the chair who presents looking like the ones on the previous page.

The strongest thing we have to help fight that demineralization is fluoride. Fluoride is typically offered to children but there's a strong case for offering fluoride to adults: So it's important to think about when you offer fluoride.

Do you know what happens in your practice? We often find there's disconnect between perception and reality. Some think that it's offered to everyone in their practice. But acceptance rates don't lie so well look at how you can track what's happening in your practice.

We'll also look at some verbal tools you can use to increase that acceptance rate.

# Fluoride Benefits

Current research shows:

- Up to 75% reduction in new decay for patients having regular in-office fluoride treatment at the dentist

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Helps prevent cervical decay this is significant because over 500 prescription medicines cause xerostomia or dry mouth. One of the biggest side-effects of xerostomia is cervical decay. So anyone on any type of prescription medication would most likely be a good candidate for fluoride. Fluoride helps reduce sensitivity and current studies show that 80% of the population complains about sensitive teeth.

Fluoride helps prolong the life of crowns and other restorations. The fluoride fee is much lower than for crowns. So a patient who has invested in just one crown, veneer, inlay or onlay will recognize that even in a crazy economy—perhaps especially in a crazy economy—fluoride treatment can be a good investment: They see that the investment now will save them time and money and potential cavities down the road and they go for it.

Practitioners are sometimes surprised how often patients will accept fluoride treatment if it's presented correctly. Sometimes it's not what you say; it's how you say it.

# The current research points to the following:

- Fluoride treatment should be completed on all patients regardless of age every 3-6 months. They get most benefit out of the product if we give it to them every 3 months. So anyone coming in on a 3-month recall basis would benefit from a fluoride treatment every time they come in.
- In-office fluoride benefits all ages.
- We provide a professional strength topical fluoride to every patient who gets their teeth polished.
- Varnish provides a more effective benefit than other in-office alternatives.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Who really needs Fluoride?

Some of us may be offering fluoride to adults but not really strongly recommending it. It's important to change your paradigm about who needs fluoride and just as important how do we get them to do it?

Sometimes the ones who really need it are the ones who don't want to do it.

In 2004, the Australian Dental Association said:

"A person's diet has the potential for overcoming the beneficial effect of fluoride, with the high frequency of prolonging exposure to dietary sugars and starches posing the highest risk."

And

"Factors that have the potential to affect the quality of saliva [such as smoking, substance abuse, some medications, aging and radiation therapy] create an oral environment that may overcome the benefits of fluoride."

So even if you have fluoride in the water, even if the patient is using a prescription-strength fluoride product at home, their diet can overcome the beneficial effects of this fluoride especially if it has sugars and starches in it. So fluoride in the water and at-home medications are not enough:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# What constitutes High Risk for Adult patients?

High-risk patients are those that it's recommended should receive treatment every three months. So what constitutes high-risk for adult patients? According to the American Dental Association, it's anyone:

- Who has had 3 or more lesions in the last 3 years
- With suboptimal fluoride exposure - none in water or they didn't have it as a child
- Who has xerostomia or dry mouth
- Who has multiple factors that may increase caries risk - more than one of the factors from the list below.

# Factors that may increase caries risk

- High titers of cariogenic bacteria
- Chemo/radiation therapy
- Poor oral hygiene
- Eating disorders
- Prolonged nursing (bottle or breast)
- Drug/alcohol abuse
- Poor family dental health
- Irregular dental care
- Developmental or acquired enamel defects
- Cariogenic diet
- Genetic abnormality of teeth
- Active orthodontic treatment
- Physical or mental disability with inability of performing proper oral health care
- Presence of exposed root surfaces
- Multi-surface restorations
- Restoration overhangs and open margins

The overwhelming majority of adult patients have more than one of those issues.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

We have our work cut out for us! Still, we often don't offer fluoride to adults and even when we do we don't strongly recommend it enough: One of the keys is: Don't be afraid to talk about services not covered by insurance!

Too often that's a reason we don't recommend it. We all have a responsibility to recommend what is best for our patients, not only what is allowed by insurance. Some practices believe so strongly in the benefits of fluoride that they include it in the prophy but they don't charge extra for it.

But you have the opportunity to increase your revenue with fluoride and the beauty is that many of your patients already understand the value of it. We cover a way to overcome that challenges if it applies in your practice:

# Fluoride Introduction

Here are some ways that you can introduce fluoride to your patients and increase acceptance.

- Listen for verbal cues from patients look out for phrases like "Do I have any cavities today?" or, when you pull out the x-rays, they say "What do you see?" That suggests they are concerned about their decay. Or anyone who expresses frustration by saying something like: "No matter what I do I still get cavities." You can refer back to these statements when you suggest fluoride to them.
- When you are carrying out their normal treatment, simply say something like "The next phase of your treatment today will be a fluoride treatment."

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

There are three powerful ways to introduce fluoride:

New Research shows: If you haven't offered it consistently in the past; this explains why you are offering it now. For example:

- "New research shows that patients who have regular fluoride treatment have up to 50% fewer cavities."
- "New research shows that if you have regular fluoride treatment in the office, it may help counteract the effect of your Diet Coke drinking."

It's not enough just to share the research. You have to explain the benefits and make it personal to that specific patient: This is where you refer back to statements they made earlier. "You mentioned how frustrated you are that you brush and floss but still get cavities; that's why I think you should consider getting fluoride today." (Then go into some of the other risk factors the patient may have.)

"We like to see all our patients have fluoride treatment. This is why I think you should have one."

We can then talk about the costs.

# Good news / bad news

- The bad news is it's not covered by your insurance.
- The good news: it's only $29, it's not going to break the bank.

For most people that's not a big investment. Put the cost into perspective for them: it's less than a tank of gas or a trip to McDonald's with the kids.

If we've made the benefits clear, it's a no-brainer that patients will want to do it.

©2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Fluoride Varnish

There are significant benefits in using fluoride varnish, including:

- It is 80% longer lasting than topical in-office fluoride
- It has a desensitizing benefit and re-mineralization benefit in the same way as traditional treatments
- Sometimes for US offices there is an insurance benefit under code 09910 'Application of desensitizing agent'

With the varnish it's helpful to warn patients of a 'slimy feeling' and they won't complain about it:

Offering the varnish is one way to recover production if you've been including it for patients already. You can tell them the traditional foam is still included with their treatment but they can 'upgrade' to the varnish.

Point out that it's 80% more effective and many patients will opt for it. Even at a fee of about $15-18, it's helped many offices boost their production considerably.

# Home Fluoride

Those who really need it should have all the tools that we have at our disposal so home fluorides should be available in the office.

Think about which patients need this help the most. They need it because they don't follow through with our recommendations!

So if we hand them the prescription and tell them to stop by the pharmacy and pick it up, recognize they're often not going to follow through:

02014 The Team Training Institute 20
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Having prescription-strength fluorides available in the office is a great service to our patients:

# The benefits of prescription-strength fluoride gels include:

- Easy to brush on
- Kid-friendly flavors
- Neutral formulations available
- Anti-cavity and anti-plaque benefits
- De-sensitization
- Re-mineralization

Some wonder if home treatments are needed when they are getting treatment in the office. But, if they are high-risk, the daily product is like the daily multivitamin. When they come to the office it's that extra dose needed to tackle the infection.

There are also prescription-strength fluoride rinses available.

- These are 4 times as strong as over the counter rinses.
- When patients aren't brushing well, the rinse can be very powerful.
- Rinses offer better coverage than brush on options so you're more likely to get that fluoride where it needs to be.
- They are great for orthodontic patients.
- They are alcohol-free.
- Some also have periodontal benefits.

It's not necessary to carry over the counter ranges in the office. Concentrate on prescription strength products.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

5000 Parts per Million Toothpastes can also be a good option. To receive the best benefit, patients must follow proper usage recommendations. Don't just write the prescription; you have to educate them on how to best use the product.

# What does this mean for hygiene profitability?

There are a wide variety of different offices and different ways of working such as assisted or non-assisted:

Take an average office with 8 patients per day and a fluoride fee of $25. If you get 80% acceptance of in-office fluoride treatments, the extra revenue to the practice is $34,600 per year per full-time hygienist. If acceptance of take-home fluoride is 25% at the lowest fees, that's an further $5,250 extra.

So just by maximizing the potential of our fluoride products, we can see an extra $40,000 of production per year. If you actually see 12 patients a day, you can increase those numbers by 50%. If you have more than one full-time hygienist, those numbers become even bigger.

If you're on production-based compensation, that growth also means an immediate increase in your paycheck. But don't just focus on that number; think also about the number of patients who are getting a better service from you: Your patients deserve the best. That's why it's important to measure the numbers so that we know exactly what's going on.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Perception v Reality

# What's Happening in Your Practice

Here'$ how we measure the numbers so that we know what's happening in our practice and measure our acceptance percentages.

# Homework: Productivity audit

Start by running a productivity audit. You can do this for the hygiene department overall but you should also work out your personal productivity. The US national average per hygienist is $61 per hour but most of our Hygiene Diamonds Peak Producers easily reach their goal of $200 per hour non-assisted or $300 per hour assisted.

Clearly, fluoride is not going to take you there on its own. We'll be covering more over these eight sessions and you'll be learning more as you go.

So you want to work out your own hourly production and work out where it is in relation to Hygiene Diamonds Peak Producers. You need to run your hygiene production summary example on the following page maybe for the first six months of this year or the last six months e.g: March - September.

Often your software will figure out what your hourly production is for you: If not; you need to work out how many days you were working during the period an average per month will do to give you your daily production.

If you have an office manager or someone who specializes in working with these reports, they can help you.

# Acceptance percentage

Here's how you work out your acceptance percentage: how many of your adult patients are accepting fluoride.

Start by working out the total number of prophies you have done. In the example below it's 1377.

Then add to that the number of perio maintenance services done. Here it's 214.

So we add the 1377 prophies and the 214 perio maintenance treatments. This means we had 1591 potential fluoride treatments.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Then you find out how many fluoride treatments were actually done: In this example, we have 334.

So 334 fluorides out of 1591 possible = 20% acceptance.

Your task for this week is to fill out a goal tracker like the one on the following page, listing:

- Date
- No of adult patients seen
- No of adult fluoride treatments done
- $ value production of fluoride treatments

You can do that each day and you’ll get a value for a whole month.

# Questions & Answers from the Session

1. We've been offering fluoride as a bonus on pre-payment plan. Is this a good idea?

There are probably other bonuses you can offer and which may even be more effective. When you give away treatment for free, it sets a precedent that people expect to be followed every time.
2. Should we include child prophies in the analysis of numbers?

Keep the child numbers separate as we do these as a matter of routine. We want to focus on the adult numbers. We usually count them as adults as soon as they have permanent teeth usually around 13 or 14.
3. How do we charge out fluoride varnish?

Sometimes it can be billed as code 09910 'Application of desensitizing medicament'. Other times it's just charged as an 'adult fluoride treatment'. It can be charged at the same fee as a standard fluoride application if you wish.
4. Are you tabulating doctor exams and reduced fees in measuring production?

We normally measure everything that happens in hygiene with the exception of the doctor's exams. But, if you have been adding doctor's exams into your production, it may be too much work to take them out so use whatever you come up with as your hygiene number. For reduced fees, it depends on how your practice is set up. Just make sure your future reporting is consistent.

# Review of Previous Module

I'm always excited to see the results people are getting from implementing the procedures that we talk about:

When we look at the feedback on the previous session on fluoride, we often find that acceptance rates are slower at the start and then increase. We see many practices starting to get acceptance rates of 80 and 90% as they start to implement these ideas. In one case, acceptance for the first couple of days was 60% and then it rose to 100% over the next couple of days.

For the most part acceptance increases as your verbal skills improve. So if you're not thrilled yet with the results you're getting, keep practicing and you'll see your acceptance increasing as your verbal skills improve.

We'll be covering a lot of new information over the next steps of this program but don't lose your focus on fluoride. It should be added in now as an important and permanent part of your daily routine.

# Adding More to Your Offer:

# Bonded Same-Day Preventive Services

# #1 Sealants

When we talk about maximizing your role as a preventive therapist, we're really looking to add services to your hygiene menu:

"We're not going to talk to every single patient about every possible option:"

When you go to a restaurant; there are many options on the menu and you're not expected to order one of everything:

It's just the same when patients are in the chair. We're not going to talk to every single patient about every possible option. They'd quickly get overwhelmed and would end up ordering nothing:

In this module, we'll look at bonded same-day preventive services and more options you can add in. The first of these is sealants.

# Sealants

When many offices start to offer adult fluoride, they find that patients are very interested in prevention.

Looking at the feedback from the first module, it almost always shows that at least some of the patients in a day are accepting fluoride. So they have an established interest in prevention.

Here's what the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics says about sealants:

02014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

"Everyone has a 95 percent chance of eventually experiencing caries in the pits and fissures of their teeth, if sealants are not used in those areas: The ADA accepted sealants in 1971 and they didn't present it as something just for children - (The application of dental sealants is an extremely simple procedure to perform and does not cause any discomfort for the patient. Because of their simplicity and effectiveness, from a health standpoint; sealants make excellent sense for both children and adults. So we need to shift our paradigm a little. Even early stage decay can be stopped by sealants. Looking at the picture below it's obvious one of the teeth is protected and the other is not.

Chowing surface
Tooth protected by shaded sealant
Even although there may be a hint of early decay in that groove, studies have shown that the sealant can halt the progression of that lesion. ADA research has shown that sealants placed on top of a cavity in the early.

02014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Stages of decay development can arrest the caries by cutting off the supply of nutrients to the cavity.

Even cavities large enough to be seen on an X-ray or dental radiograph do not become worse when a sealant is used.

It's important to note that today's sealants are very different from the sealants of 10 to 15 years ago.

But what I've found is that many great practitioners quit doing sealants in the past because of the problems they caused.

Sealant materials have improved significantly in recent years and we now have the research to back up their effectiveness.

But you don't just want to be adding on sealants without caring about your protocol. It's got to be a good sealant to be effective.

# Our goal for this module is to recommend sealants on all posterior teeth

That means NOT only on those that Insurance will pay for! We have to get away from looking just at what we know to be covered teeth:

We often focus on permanent molars only and on children under 14 because that's when insurance helps us.

However, prevention is important to our patients and we have other patients who could use help in this way.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

We see grooves like those on the previous page all the time. Typically we'd look at them and think sealant if the patient was in the age limit. But what if they were an 18-year old or early 20-something or 30-year old and they're into prevention and don't want to develop a cavity on that tooth? They should be given the opportunity to choose a sealant as well.

We see examples like this one all the time: 95% of the time, these grooves are going to end up with a cavity if they are not protected. So we often do think to protect the molar teeth. But what about the grooves in the example below? We have pre-molar teeth that are starting to have early lesions in the pits and grooves. So why not offer a sealant on these teeth?

With my kids, they get sealed as soon as their teeth are up. Why should our patients get a different level of treatment from what members of our own family receive?

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

In my mind that's just not right. If it's good enough for members of my own family, my patients should be offered the same opportunity: So we should be looking outside of posterior molars only.

Photos can be very powerful and there are some tools we can use to improve acceptance from patients for sealants: The example below gives a clear example of a sealed tooth and an unsealed tooth and shows how they can be protected by placing a sealant:

# Placing sealants the same day

When possible place sealants the same day as diagnosis. Sealants are the top cause of cancellations in dentistry. So, whenever possible, we should aim to complete sealant procedures without having to re-appoint patients.

We need to be able to explain to the patient the benefits of why they should be willing to consider a sealant: Then we should be able to alter our systems and our strategies so that we can place that sealant the day it is diagnosed.

Many people say they just don't have time to place sealants the same day ~ maybe they only have 30 minutes for the appointment: So let's look at some ways to help.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# How to Offer Same Day Preventive Procedures

An easy way to be able to offer same-day sealants is to have the sealants set up in each operatory. This is quite straightforward but often we don't think that far ahead. We have a setup of 7-8 ziplok Baggies in each operatory. So we'll include anything in there that's not already included in our initial setup such as cotton rolls or dry aids. Any tools that you want to have ready for sealants should be set up in advance in the Baggies. So when you notice the opportunity for a sealant all you have to do is open the drawer and pull out the Baggie: You are set up and ready to go.

You also want to have easy access to a curing light.

# Discussion with Parent

You need to begin the discussion with parent/patient at the beginning of the appointment: If you wait until the end, there is no time left:

The discussion with the parent often goes something like this: Hey great news! We have eight permanent teeth that have erupted since you were here last. We know how important preventing cavities is to you and you want to.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

make sure these teeth are protected. So we've got eight teeth that we'd like to go ahead and get protected:

If you have an intra-oral camera, you can show the photo of what these grooves look like.

Then you can follow up by saying:

"I know how busy you are, and how hard it is for you to get your children here. We will do everything we can to get this taken care of today while you are here."

At that point; the parent usually wants to know how much it is going to cost and whether their insurance covers it.

You can then pass the baton over to your finance person or someone at the front desk or whoever in your team handles those questions:

You can then continue on with the prophy.

While the financial questions are being handled, you are moving forward with treatment.

# Diagnodent is Powerful

If possible, the teeth with potential for sealants should be pre-screened with the Diagnodent:

There are also now other brands of cavity-detecting lasers; the actual brand you use is not important but it is a really powerful tool.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Many offices are using them consistently. But others have them and are not utilizing them effectively because they haven't adapted their structures and systems to make best use of them:

Other offices have ordered them in the past but never implemented them properly and sometimes have sent them back or sold them on eBay.

When the Diagnodent is incorporated effectively, patients love it too. Patients find it fascinating! When they are able to follow along; they are more involved in the process. We want them to be involved and keyed in to what we are doing for them in their mouth:

When it becomes part of the process, patients even ask to have it done. People have called in saying: "My wife was in and had this laser used and I didn't get that. I'd really like to see that; can I come back in and have you do that for me?"

If you introduce it properly it can create a great Word-of-Mouth buzz. And that's really important when we're trying to grow the practice with referrals: We want everyone in the community to be talking about the steps we are taking to make sure our patients are being served better than anywhere else.

This tool is your key to doing an incredible amount of sealants on adults!

©2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Sealants for Adults

When patients know the tools we have at our disposal, they are impressed and they want them to be used.

We pre-screen adults with Diagnodent. It will make a warning sound when it hits a 10. In my practice, we generally do a filling when it hits 20, so anything between 10 and 20, we will talk about an elective sealant with the patient: The threshold numbers will vary slightly between different practices. We'll say to a patient:

“With that tooth that has some early bacterial involvement going on, we can place a sealant on it; protect it and hopefully prevent the cavity from getting worse.”

Or

“We can just wait until it gets worse and put a filling there.”

When it's presented in that way, it shifts the paradigm for the patient. Although it represents an out-of-pocket cost of about $65, many see the benefit of paying that rather than have a cavity later. Even with insurance, their co-payment for a cavity may be significantly higher: You'll be surprised at how many adult patients, given the opportunity, will move forward with sealants.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Using your 'time savers'

If it's been some time since you placed sealants, you probably want to spend a bit of time practicing to find out who on the team might benefit from sealants or who has family members that might benefit:

Work on getting your speed up. One of the best tools is a good old-fashioned cotton roll holder made by Garmer. With this, you can work on an entire quadrant at once. You can etch upper and lower at the same time and work on several teeth: It ultimately saves us time.

The key to improving your speed with sealants is to time yourself: Anyone who is working on improving their time records their time and checks to see how long it takes and looks to do better next time. It's not all about the clock of course we need to put out a quality sealant: But it is about being aware of how long it takes us. Sometimes we want to pad our time to make sure there is enough. But we lose sight of the goal of being productive. We can't be productive if we are constantly padding our time.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# The Financial Discussion

How we present the finances for elective sealants will be a big factor in whether the patient moves forward or not.

Focus on what insurance will pay, not what they WON'T pay.

For example, if you have eight teeth with potential for sealants, don't say:

"Four of the teeth are permanent molars so they are covered by your insurance 100% and the other four have zero insurance coverage. What would you like us to do?"

In this case, chances are the parent is going to ask you to do the four that are covered 100% and not do the others.

Here's another way to present it:

"We've got eight teeth that can be protected by a sealant that's a total of $320. It looks like your insurance is going to pay about $160, that's leaves your co-payment of about $160 and here are your options."

It has a very different effect:

So focus on the total dollar amount and make sure you have flexible options for the difference.

# When the schedule is busy

So what do you do if you want to place a sealant and the schedule says you have another patient in 10 minutes?

The first point to consider is that the schedule may not be correct; the patient may be late or may not show.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The best approach is to continue working on the current patient until your next patient has arrived and is ready to get started. Then take stock of where you are; if you have two sealants to do, chances are it's best to go ahead and finish these two sealants.

Look and see if other members of the team can make a start with the next patient. When it comes to being productive, teamwork is key. We also need to be able to provide teamwork; we need to be happy to step in and help others when needed.

# What does this mean for hygiene profitability?

Sealants can be a huge boost to your daily production.

Adding 4 sealants per day in hygiene on average
means an increase of $34,560 per year
The record number of sealants we know about in one day by a single hygienist is 821. Remember sealants are not just for children; they can be offered to adults as well. And they are accepted a lot: You just need to work along with 80% acceptance for fluoride, this first session already gives you an increase of around $70,000 a year per hygienist.

# Bonded Same Day Preventive Services

# #2 Desensitizing Agents

We know that 80% of adults suffer from sensitive teeth:

We also know that hypersensitivity affects 45 million adults in the United States and that 10 million people are chronically affected with sensitive teeth:

This is a significant issue for many of our patients.

There are many causes of sensitive teeth but many of our patients may not be aware of these:

- Brushing with too much pressure removes gum tissue. 2 out of 3 people brush too hard which may be a reason so many suffer from this.
- Aging can lead to sensitivity—many people are surprised that sensitivity is highest between the ages of 25-30. You might have expected the age of target patients to be higher.
- Stimulation from hot beverages or foods can cause sensitivity.
- Tooth whitening can sometimes lead to sensitivity—at least for a few days while the whitening is taking effect.
- Cracked teeth.
- Grinding your teeth.

C2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Long-term use of mouthwashes such as Listerine can damage dentin and cause sensitivity. It can also sometimes reverse the beneficial effects of toothpaste.

Enamel erosion by acidic foods as we discussed in the first module.

Root sensitivity can occur after having teeth cleaned, following root planing, crown placement or even having fillings. This sensitivity will normally disappear in about four to six weeks but it can be annoying for the patient and they may end up blaming us. So it's useful to know what we can do to counteract that issue.

People with sensitivities to sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch also usually have sensitive teeth.

Exposed surfaces are often sensitive. Here's a glaring example of some hyper-exposed areas:

These are likely to be causing problems for the patient.

In the past, we haven't had a good way of addressing these concerns. There have been several bonded products available for some time but they were all designed to go underneath a resin or other material. They weren't designed to stand alone.

There is now at least one option that meets this need:

02014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It is Brush and Bond by Parkell. It's a stand-alone and has been proven to last up to three years. It's a very easy product to apply and this can be done chair-side in hygiene.

The fee can be significant and ranges between 822-39. That's based on the schedules of benefits of several insurance companies under code 09911 - desensitizing treatment per tooth. Just being listed is no guarantee of payment by the insurance companies. If it's being billed routinely, insurance companies may not know how to handle it: not as for sealants, they will ask for a tooth number.

# Offering guarantees

This is an offer that works particularly well with a guarantee. You may have seen the advertisements for 'Snuggies'. It may not seem an obvious product but one of the reasons so many people buy it is because of the guarantee. So, if you were to offer a guarantee with desensitizing agents, how many more patients would try it?

02014 The Team Training Institute 17
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It's difficult to explain to a patient that the tooth that's extremely sensitive to cold or to touch can instantly not be sensitive. So it can be very powerful to just show people how it works. You can offer people the opportunity to try it out on their most sensitive tooth. You say:

“Let’s try it on your most sensitive tooth. If it doesn’t work, you don’t have to pay for it. If it does work, it's only $29.”

And here's the thing: it always works!

Simple to place. It's very simple to apply. You use your little micro-brush to apply it, you light-cure it; you brush it on again and light-cure it. Then you're done. Then you hit it with the air and the patient feels absolutely nothing. It's a great before-and-after.

The desensitizing agent works particularly well with exposed root surfaces. So if you have several of these, it's time to offer something more than fluoride. The fluoride helps strengthen those surfaces but the goal of the fluoride is to coat the surfaces of all of the teeth. When you have exposed surfaces where that cementum is exposed on one tooth, that tooth becomes a great candidate for the desensitizing agent especially if it's giving them discomfort.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Again photos can be powerful. You can use them to demonstrate what needs to be done.

Brush and Bond has been formulated and proven to last for up to three years. There are rarely problems. But if the patient has sensitivity creeping back into the area, make sure it's been applied correctly and check to see if there is deeper recession.

# What does this mean for hygiene profitability?

You have to pay attention and look for areas that may be exposed: If you have those exposed root surfaces, treatment may be beneficial to your patient so you can offer it to them. Sometimes when offered the guarantee, patients ask to have more teeth done.

Patients who have had this chronic sensitivity are thrilled: So if you have four teeth treated per day in hygiene, that's four teeth, not four patients on average this means an increase of $34,560 per year. Add this to the potential with sealants we already covered, we have a total of $69,120 increase!

Same-day bonded preventive services can be so productive.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# This Week's Goal Tracker

Weve added some columns to this weeks goal tracker. We still have number of adult fluorides as before and revenue from fluoride: Then we have number of sealants done and number of desensitizing agents and the production from each: It's important to stay focused and look for opportunities: If you focus on the benefits for the patients, many will move forward with treatment even if it's not covered by their insurance.

"Knowing is not enough; we must apply: Willing is not enough; we must do." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

"Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm." - Ralph Waldo Emerson

If patients can sense you are enthusiastic about these treatments and that you are sincere, they will respond much more positively than they would otherwise.

# Questions

# Answers from the Session

1. Can fluoride varnish be placed immediately after desensitizing agents?
Yes. It should be in that order5 desensitizing agent then fluoride varnish.
2. How long does desensitizing agent last?
Recent research shows the effect of Brush & Bond lasts up to three years. If patient notices sensitivity creeping back check for further recession. We've rarely had to do a patch orupdate of the treatment.
3. Our office has been giving free fluoride for the past 25 years: What do you recommend?
You can continue offering the free fluoride they have been used to the rinse, foam or gel. You can then offer fluoride varnish as an upsell: "We have a new product that's 80% more effective. It's a little more expensive. If the extra payment is about $15 for the varnish, you'll be surprised at how many are willing to pay the extra."
4. How long do you reseal at no charge?
This depends on the situation, for example whether the patient has been keeping up hygiene visits. Usually we'd reseal after six months or after 12 months if the patient has been attending hygiene visits. Beyond that it depends on the individual circumstances.
5. Should all decay be removed before we place a sealant?
The ADA research says even early stages of decay can be stopped by placing a sealant. We don't advocate simply placing sealants over all decay but sometimes we can wait too long and find a filling is needed. So it's worth taking time to check out the research and recognize that patients may be better served with prevention.

# 5 Jewels for Improving Patient Retention

# Session 3

WWW .TheTeamTrainingInstitute com
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Jewel #1: First Class Service

It's not enough to market and attract new patients. It's important that we keep them long-term.

The whole purpose of attracting new patients is to get them enrolled in the practice so that they stay with us for several years.

Our marketing budget is not being invested properly if we're not able to hold on to new patients:

The new patient appointment is a working interview; it's their opportunity to determine if we are a good fit for them.

If we're not providing first class service, we're not going to be able to retain patients beyond that first appointment.

So it's important to make sure our retention strategies are in place and that we all know what they are.

- Are your practice policies inhibiting patient retention?
- How well are we serving patients?
- Do you have 'sales prevention' leaders in your practice?

If our practice policies are actually driving patients away, we've got a few things to think about.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Do our patients look forward to coming, or do they dread it? How do we compare with the DMV - the Department of Motor Vehicles? I've never heard anyone talking about going there with enthusiasm. It's one of those things they dread:

Many of us in hygiene realize that if we have systems that are not conducive to creating a positive experience for our patients, it's sometimes out of our control. But it's important we pay attention because it directly affects our success.

Our patients are looking for something that goes beyond a good cleaning and comfortable care. There are certain things they are asking for from us. Here's the top 10 list:

1. A well managed office: They don't want to be kept waiting or have frustrations with the staff. We need to come across as well-organized. We can't seem to be running behind.
2. Patients want to know what we recommend: If they didn't want our opinion, they wouldn't be there. So we need to be confident that they want our recommendation.
3. Friendly and Supportive staff: Being greeted with a smile at the front desk when they arrive goes a long way. But they are also looking for...

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Supportive staff who can deal with any issues they have.

Patients need to feel anxiety free: Many patients are very anxious about coming in to the dental office and we need to have approaches that can help eliminate their anxiety.

What options do we have to make them feel more comfortable? Do we have nitrous oxide? Have we really worked on our injection techniques? Do we have painless injection techniques in place?

There are strategies we can use to make sure this is pain free and we need to take time to discover what they are.

# 6. NO PAIN:

This is a no-brainer but we get a bad rap as an industry for providing pain. Sometimes patients will feel pain so we need to do everything possible to make it a painless experience. Do we have sedation and other resources for them?

# 5. Patients need the dentist to problem-solve in a positive way:

Too often we're non-confrontational: But if they have frustrations, we need to be able to problem-solve and address these. Otherwise they'll just leave.

# 4. Open communication:

We need to ask them for feedback in a way that they'll be willing to share openly. It's important that we know that we can be open and honest with patients. That's the basis of any healthy relationship.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# 3

Patients want to feel connected to the dentist and the team: Some patients feel they don't have a relationship with the dentist; it's been expressed as being a relationship between "the dentist's tools and my money." In order to give our patients what they want, they need to feel connected to the dentist and the team.

# 2

Skilled treatment: It's not enough just to do the treatment: We have to do it well and in such a way they're not having to get it redone in the next few years. There's sometimes a delicate balance between getting it done in a timely manner and getting it done well. We have to make sure that we're successful in navigating that balance.

# 1

Patients want what they want! Too often we don't focus on what they want: What are their priorities and issues and what are their long-term goals in dealing with their teeth? If we don't ask them what they want, how do we know that we are serving them appropriately? How do we know that they are satisfied with what they are getting? If we don't know these things, we can't hope to retain them long-term.

The new patient experience is a huge part of retaining patients: Too often we focus on the day-to-day tasks we have to carry out and we're not focusing on the patient interaction and that's what we have to get better at.

We have to make sure we are providing comfortable care.

How important is the Hygienist in patient retention? The truth is we are extremely important:

So what would your patients say about you? Is a 1110 prophy in your chair painful?

It's challenging to provide good care and make sure we don't hurt them.

# Keys to 'painless' prophies

New Paradigm: You can perform a prophy without hurting your patients.

The old paradigm was that if we weren't hurting them and they weren't bleeding; we weren't doing a good job.

Updated Instruments: We should have the instruments that allow us to provide comfortable treatment:

- Correct sharpening techniques: We have to make sure that our instruments have been sharpened appropriately. The toes should be rounded. You are not going to be able to provide comfortable care if they have been sharpened so many times that the heads resemble a sickle.
- Get paid for what you do: If you are constantly providing adjusted periodontal services and calling it a prophy, chances are your patients are hurting: We have to call it what it is and bill it appropriately.

The key is you sometimes have to ask if the patient is suffering pain.

# Jewel #3: Pre-schedule all Recare Patients

Our prescheduled rate should be 90% or higher: But many of us don't know how to measure this and some of us may not even be pre-scheduling patients at all. Some consultants advise not to pre-schedule patients but we firmly believe that we should be pre-scheduling all hygiene patients. It's a vital step to patient retention.

In some practices, this is all handled by the front desk but we’ve got to be more involved in tracking and monitoring:

The best place to schedule the patient for the next hygiene visit is in hygiene. Keeping blocks open is fine as long as they don't go un-utilized:

# Conducting a Prescheduled Audit

The first step for a pre-scheduled audit is to run a continuing care report for six months from now so after September 2009, we run a report for March 2010. Some offices can do this direct from the practice management software: The report should tell you:

- How many patients are due
- How many of those patients are actually scheduled for their preventive appointment

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

This will give you the number of unscheduled patients. All you have to do is take the number of unscheduled patients and divide it by the total number due. This gives you your percentage of patients that are pre-scheduled:

This is a valuable exercise. It's often surprising how few patients are pre-scheduled:

Even if you have 64% of your patients pre-scheduled, it still means you have a third of them walking out the back door.

We have to make sure that we pay attention to the scheduling if we want to be productive.

We have the front door wide open to new patients. We put a lot of time and energy into how to handle new patients. But none of that matters if they don't schedule for their follow-up visit.

Too often we find that we have lots of patients walking out the back door:

Patients who are not scheduled don't count as active patients.

# Jewel #4: Streamlined Recall and Recovery Strategies

We need to have a way of going after patients who have somehow fallen out of the loop.

There's a lot of detail that can be covered on recall but I want to focus on one strategy that you can share with your team and implement right away:

Recall is all about re-enrolling overdue patients. If the patients are overdue for hygiene services and not yet scheduled, if somehow they've fallen out of the schedule in some way, recall is getting them back in.

We call and we call these people. Typically we call between 4pm and 8pm because that's when we think we can get hold of most people. But we live in a fast-paced society and many people have a lot going on at that time of day. However, what matters is not when we call but the message we leave.

The problem is most of us are leaving the wrong message. Too often we say something like:

"Hi this is Wendy from ABC Dental Care. We've been reviewing your records and we've noticed that you are overdue. It's been more than six months since your last preventive visit. We know that prevention's important to you and the doctor has asked us to call -"

It absolutely doesn't work: The message to leave is very simple.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

"Hi this is Wendy from ABC Dental Care. It's important that you call me as soon as possible regarding your appointment -D)

When the patient calls back as they will they’ll say: "What appointment? I don't have an appointment:"

You then smile and you say:

"I know. That's why we called. We were calling to help you schedule your appointment."

For recall strategies to work, you need to get people calling back and this approach works:

# Recovery strategies

Recovery is when we need to fill last minute changes to the schedule. So if we have open time today or tomorrow, we are in recovery mode and we need to fill these gaps. The goal is to recover it before it's lost forever.

One of the best ways to do that is using your ASAP lists. Many of us have software that allows us to tick a box that allows us to say "As Soon As Possible". On Dentrix it's on the start button and you can easily generate a list of people who already have appointments that happen to be down the road.

When they schedule that appointment, all we have to get them to do is ask: If we get a last minute change to the schedule and something becomes available sooner, would you like to know?

For every patient who says yes they go on that list:

# Jewel #5: Patient Loyalty Program

With loyalty programs, we're hoping to create the 'Loyalty Link' a bond with our patients that isn't likely to be dissolved. We do this by creating the relationship and serving them well and having the new patient experience being positive. All of those things add up to help us start forming that bond.

But the Loyalty Link is more significant than just having satisfied patients. Harvard Business School Press tells us that:

"Selling to existing customers is far more profitable than selling to new customers"

We know this is true. Our existing customers already have respect for us and we don't have to work as hard when we are presenting treatment to them as they are more likely to accept it from the beginning. But Harvard Business School Press also tells us:

"Even 'satisfied' customers or 'very satisfied' customers defect at an alarming rate of 65%-85%"

So just having patients who are satisfied with our service isn't enough anymore:

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

We live in a society where people are being marketed to from every front: They are getting five or six offers in the mail and they may see offers from other providers on the internet; in TV commercials or hear them in radio ads. So we need the Loyalty Link something that ties them to us so that they are less likely to take up offers from other dentists in the area:

# Enrolling patients in loyalty programs becomes vital to our profitability!

The old paradigm was that if you serve your patients well, that's all you need: But that's not true anymore. Patient satisfaction isn't enough: We need to attract new patients but we need to focus time and resources on keeping existing patients in the practice. We have to give them a reason to come back.

We see this approach outside of dentistry all the time: air miles, rewards points, frequent shopper discount cards; even in Subway - buy so many sandwiches and you get one free. They're everywhere. Because they work.

With Whitening for Life, we're striving to create something in dentistry that gives patients a reason to come back. With Whitening for Life, you have the potential to turn this one-time shopper patient who may have come in because of a specific offer into a lifetime patient:

# Whitening for Life™ program

If you're trying out Whitening for Life for the first time, we'll cover how to launch it in your practice:

If you're already using it, we'll give you 5 jewels on how to use the program better as an internal and external marketing tool.

The whole purpose of Whitening for Life is to enroll as many patients as possible.

We offer it for a low one-time enrollment fee: The most effective fee is usually $99.

Every time they return to your office for their 6-month hygiene visit they receive a complimentary touch up kit:

You should offer this to everyone. There are a number of conditions of enrollment. Patients agree to:

- Stay current on recall
- Give 24 (or 48) hours notice before canceling or changing an appointment

Just by enrolling them, we're explaining to the patient in polite and professional terms what's expected.

We're also reminding them that prevention is an important part of their long-term health. By keeping these appointments, many patients have been able to greatly reduce emergencies.

# Getting Started in 7 Simple Steps

# Step One:

Designate a WFL Specialist on the team to spearhead this program and get it launched in your office. Sometimes it's the hygienist or assistant; in some offices, it's the hygiene coordinator or marketing assistant.

# Step Two:

WFL Specialist reviews material in Jumpstart Kit.

# Step Three:

WFL Specialist prints off enrollment forms with office logo or name on them.

# Step Four:

Wholesale bleach product is ordered if needed. Some offices prefer to wait until they get all the materials including the bleach; but I'd encourage you to launch it as soon as you can.

# Step Five:

WFL Specialist conducts Staff Meeting to review program with everyone on the Team. This can be very quick—it can happen in the morning huddle. It doesn't have to be long and drawn out. We include scripts so everyone can offer the program with confidence. For example, you need to know what to say to Whitening for Life members who phone up to cancel appointments. They need to know what is working elsewhere and how to introduce the program to their patients. Everyone needs to be speaking the same language!

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Step Six: Market the program

The main value of Whitening for Life is as a patient retention program but it can help attract a considerable amount of new patients. Marketing the program is about starting to talk about it—having the team promoting it and offering it to patients.

# Step Seven: Start enrolling patients!

# What does this mean for hygiene profitability?

WFL enrollments add to production. The $99 enrolment fee is worth having in the schedule. But the true value of the program is retaining patients long-term: That's why we are able to offer it for only $99.

It's nice to have the production on the front end: But it's about giving patients a reason to keep their appointments, minimizing no-shows and reducing cancellations.

Many offices are reporting an average of 25+ patients per month enrolling. We have some superstars; some offices have enrolled 300 patients in 8 weeks and others have enrolled 9-12 patients in one day per hygienist. We had one who enrolled 66 patients in the first 30 days.

Obviously it depends on how big your practice is, how many hygienists you have and how big a focus you're going to put on Whitening for Life.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

How can [ GET Whitening for LifeTM in my office?

We have Whitening for Life members in more than 28 countries and a great rate of success. So it's an exciting program to be part of.

A 60-day free trial to Whitening for Life is included in Hygiene Explosion 2.0 so you get a chance to try it out for 8 weeks and see if it works for your practice in patient retention.

# 5 Ideas for Making the Most of Whitening for LifeTM

# ONE:

Hand every patient an enrollment form when they check in at the front desk. This applies to every patient not just hygiene patients. You will be amazed at what happens to enrollment!

# TWO:

Have a banner promoting WFL outside your practice. Artwork is available in the members-only area of the team website.

# THREE:

Use WFL to promote your practice at events. Whitening for Life is a great offer to have at bridal fairs, home shows, women's shows, beauty shows or anything else that has a large crowd of people. Many clients have had great success with unique offers such as bridal party packages and gifts.

Two-for-one offers during the Holidays are also popular. You can give patients a gift certificate to give away when they enroll. They may give that to someone who is not currently a patient.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# FOUR: Send out WFL offers to Human Resources

Send an offer to the HR departments of large businesses or employers near you. Let them know you accept their insurance, and that you are willing to provide an amazing offer for their employees. Follow this up with the value to their company of their employees having a whiter, brighter smile, more confidence!

# FIVE: Use FREE Whitening for Life enrollments as a referral award:

If they refer one patient, 50% off enrollment; if they refer two patients enrollment is FREE!

WFL is one of the most powerful programs for generating referrals. You can't expect your patients to know that you want referrals; you have to ask for them.

# Questions

# Answers from the Session

1. A large percentage of our patients can't whiten due to having a full mouth of crowns. What are the options?

There are other patient retention programs that you can put in place such as a warranty program. If you are doing a lot of full-mouth reconstruction cases, you can have some form of written warranty that states we replace at no charge provided certain conditions are met. Patient loyalty extends beyond whitening but this is a great way to get a program started.
2. What's the best way to approach a human resources department?

You can create a nice professional letter on office letterhead. It's a good idea to first approach the ones whose insurance you accept. Tell them you have a great service that their employees and the company would benefit from. Tell them how valuable it is to have a nicer smile.
3. Are patients required to have an X-ray to make sure they don't have decay?

Part of the program is that they have to stay current on their hygiene program to benefit.
4. When pre-scheduling patients, if your schedule is full for several weeks, do you move prophy patients to make room for a perio case or do you leave room for this?

Ideally you have things blocked out in your schedule such as new patient appointments as well as a few for perio. The key thing is you don't need to pre-schedule six months to the day. You can go six months and two weeks. That gives you more flexibility to move patients forward.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Early Detection

The advancements in dentistry in recent years have enhanced our role as preventive therapists and helped us detect things earlier:

One thing that has changed greatly is how we use radiographs. But many of us have not yet updated our policies and procedures especially with the emergence of new technologies such as digital x-rays.

Too often we are lax in taking necessary radiographs and not following an exact protocol.

For example, do you know the recommended time frame for radiographs? Radiograph recommendations were updated by the ADA as recently as 2005. Yet many of us haven't taken the time to step back and evaluate what we are doing and decide if our protocol should be different for high-risk patients.

In 2002, the American Dental Association, recognizing that there had been advancements in dental technology and science, recommended to the FDA that the guidelines be reviewed for possible updating:

The FDA welcomed this interest in maintaining the guidelines, and so the American Dental Association undertook this review. The ADA presented their recommendations to the FDA in 2004 and they were adopted later that year with recommendations on what that meant for use of radiographs in 2005.

In this module, we review what that means for you in your practice; what it means for children, adolescents and high-risk patients. And we'll cover the

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Opportunities it creates to better serve our patients and increase productivity:

# So what are radiographs used for? According to the ADA:

"Radiographs and other imaging modalities are used to diagnose and monitor oral diseases, as well as to monitor development and the progress or prognosis of therapy."

X-rays are used for more than just diagnosing decay:

When many of us went through our schooling; we were taught to be ultra-conservative with X-rays. The protocol that many of us learned was due to the higher exposure that patients were exposed to when we took X-ray films.

But now we have both digital imaging and conventional film. So that's one reason we need to review our practices now.

# Digital X-rays

If you're still using conventional film, there are a few important points to take into account: Speeds have greatly increased so that means less exposure to radiation for the patient up to 90% less for digital imaging, depending on where you were initially.

There are some clear cut advantages to digital imaging that were laid out in the ADA update. As well as reduced radiation exposure, digital X-rays enhance the sensitivity so we're able to detect more. We can play with the image to sharpen it and use the special tools available to enhance it and determine if there is an issue.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Another key feature is that we have reduced error we can know right away if we have the image we want:

So digital film has a lot of advantages over traditional film.

If you're still using conventional film, keep in mind that the speed of the film is key and even going for an e-speed film can reduce the radiation exposure for the patient:

# When to Use Radiographs

The ADA Guidelines give guidance on when to prescribe radiographs. They state:

"The development and progress of many oral conditions are associated with a patient's age, stage of dental development, and vulnerability to known risk factors."

The following are some clinical situations for which radiographs may be indicated:

# Positive Historical Findings of any of the following:

- Previous periodontal or endodontic treatment
- History of pain or trauma to the area
- Family history of dental anomalies
- Post-operative evaluation of healing
- Remineralization monitoring
- Presence of implants or evaluation for implant placement

Having more than 20 clinical symptoms to look out for emphasizes the importance of being thorough with our policy:⁹⁹

# Positive Clinical Symptoms

There are more than 20 clinical symptoms to look out for and this emphasizes the importance of being very thorough with our X-ray policy: All of these are positive clinical symptoms that would justify an X-ray.

1. Clinical evidence of periodontal disease
2. Large or deep restorations

©2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

1. Deep carious lesions
2. Malposed or clinically impacted teeth
3. Swelling
4. Evidence of dental/ facial trauma
5. Mobility of teeth
6. Sinus tract ("fistula")
7. Clinically suspected sinus pathology
8. Growth abnormalities
9. Oral involvement in known or suspected systemic disease such as diabetes, leukemia, AIDS and any immuno-repressed diseases
10. Positive neurologic findings in the head and neck
11. Evidence of foreign objects
12. Pain and/or dysfunction of TMJ
13. Facial asymmetry
14. Abutment teeth for fixed or removable partial prosthesis
15. Unexplained bleeding

# Factors Increasing Risk for Caries

We talked initially about age, developmental factors, history and clinical symptoms. Risk factors would be another consideration in deciding whether to prescribe X-rays so here are the main risk factors highlighted by the ADA:

1. High level of caries experience or demineralization
2. History of recurrent caries
3. High titers of cariogenic bacteria
4. Existing restoration(s) of poor quality
5. Poor oral hygiene
6. Inadequate fluoride exposure
7. Prolonged nursing (bottle or breast)
8. Frequent high sucrose content in diet
9. Poor family dental health
10. Developmental or acquired enamel defects
11. Developmental or acquired disability
12. Xerostomia. 500 prescription medications contribute to dry mouth. Anyone on any type of prescription medication is automatically in the high-risk category.

©2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# 13. Genetic abnormality of teeth

# 14. Many multi-surface restorations

# 15. Chemo/radiation therapy in history

"The biggest risk factor is that many patients have not seen a dentist for several years."

# 16. Eating disorders

Many patients have not seen a dentist for several years; this is often the biggest factor.

# 17. Drug/alcohol abuse

# 18. Irregular dental care

Some patients have not seen a dentist for several years; this is often the biggest factor.

There is still no clear-cut guideline here so we have to look at what we are doing in the light of the ADA recommendations. Here's what the ADA says:

"Professional judgment should be used to determine the optimum time for radiographic examination within the suggested interval."

# ADA Protocol for New Patient Child with Primary Dentition

Primary means they have not yet had any permanent teeth erupt, usually age 5 or 6 or under.

- Individualized radiographic exam
- Selected periapical views and/or posterior bitewings
- Patients without evidence of disease and wide open contacts may not require radiographs if you have a young patient and you can see and touch everything and it looks good; we may not need radiographs.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# New child patient with transitional dentition or Adolescent

Individualized radiographic exam

- Posterior bitewings with panoramic examination usually around age 7
- checking development of the teeth
- OR Posterior Bitewings with selected periapical images

# Child, Transitional, Adolescent: Recall patient with clinical caries OR at increased risk for caries

Most children you see are likely to face at least one of the 18 risk factors. So its likely that most of the children in your chair are likely to fall into the high-risk category.

ADA: Posterior bitewing exam at 6 to 12 month intervals

In my experience, the overwhelming majority of our patients are high-risk:

So we need to evaluate what we are doing~especially for children: All of the ADA evidence seems to suggest that X-rays are warranted for high-risk patients at six-monthly intervals. That may require a change in mindset for some of us.

# Adult new patient

- Posterior bitewings with panoramic exam
- OR Full mouth intra-oral radiograph examination is preferred when the patient has clinical evidence of disease

# Adult recall patient with clinical caries OR at increased risk for caries

They would have one of the 22 clinical symptoms Or one of the 18 risk factors.

You could find that the majority of your patients fit into one of these categories.

ADA: Posterior bitewing exam at 6 to 12 month intervals

Digital or traditional?

Digital films have up to 90% less radiation than traditional films and high speed films also have drastically lower radiation.

If I was the patient and I was given the chance to catch something when it's small obviously I think the wisest choice is to catch it when it's small.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Case Studies

Here we look at some examples of issues that have come up in my practice which highlighted the importance of evaluating the ADA guidelines.

# Full series of X-rays

The first is a patient who hadn't been in practice for 18 months. When we reviewed the records, they were overdue for a full mouth series. And this showed the risk factor of irregular dental care.

So we took a full series of X-rays and what you can see here on the second X-ray shows why it was important: We might have found this when cleaning but, with the X-ray, we didn't have to rely on finding it by accident. We knew it was there and were able to adjust accordingly.

The point with X-rays is being very thorough and the guidelines are thorough. We shouldn't worry about being too thorough; we should worry about being thorough enough.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Standards of care

In this next example, you can see the mesula 14 underneath the restoration. We noticed a shadow. The doctor felt that because it was a fairly new filling, it may be due to the new liner so we decided to take a screenshot and monitor it again in 6 months. As you can see here, it was definitely not the liner. There was decay under the filling and we were almost into the root canal:

The interesting point for me was that this was actually my husband. My mindset for establishing the right level of care is that the patient in my chair deserves to be treated as if they were a member of my own family. If I would not recommend it to my mother, sister or brother, I would not recommend it to my patients. Likewise, if I feel it's important for my mother, husband or children, my patients deserve the same level of courtesy as if they were a member of my own family.

When we started taking X-rays every six months for members of my family, it really became time to re-evaluate our practice position on high-risk patients. We found we were doing high-risk patients every 12 months and we realized that it wasn't often enough.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Taking two X-rays

Some practices take two X-rays every six months or year, rather than four. This is often because it's the way they’ve always done it. They feel the two films allow them to see everything they need:

This example shows that to be able to maximize early detection capabilities, we need to have more than one viewpoint. The second X-ray was taken the exact same day. There is not even a hint there could be a problem on the first film.

The crown itself was blocking the decay. This is a good example of why we should be focusing on a more thorough series of X-rays especially on patients considered to be high-risk.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# The Best Time to Treat Decay

There are no benefits in waiting to treat decay. Decay is a bacterial-induced condition: It spreads and it can be more complicated to treat the more progressed it becomes.

Re-building decay and treating advanced infections is no fun for the patient or for the dental team.

- Patients are in significant pain.
- And we don't like the weekend callouts and dealing with 'Bombed-out' teeth.

That's why it's a good time to review whether we need to make a change in X-ray and better comply with the ADA's 2005 guidelines.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Anterior PAs

My challenge question is "When are you taking anterior PAs?"

We might take an anterior PA if we notice a problem or if we see something that looks suspicious. But many of us don't have it as part of our regular system to take anterior PAs. My challenge for you is to go ahead and evaluate what you may be missing.

We find there's a lot of decay in the anterior region: Things have changed. We didn't take them often because it seemed there wasn't much we would find there. But these 18 risk factors we've already covered such as high levels of bacteria in the mouth, existing restorations of poor quality, poor oral hygiene, inadequate fluoride, high sugar diet, soda habits can drastically affect anterior teeth.

In the example on the right, the provider thought the tooth was part of the bridge and didn't even realize there was a root tip there.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

This adult patient is a good example of what can happen around existing restorations. Having restorations doesn't mean they won't get decay.

# Finding Decay in the Front Areas

With children we're finding decay in the front areas of the mouth. So it's important we screen these regularly. Sometimes you'll find big problems in the anterior area such as asymptomatic abscesses from previous trauma. By taking these anterior screening films we can detect problems that haven't started causing symptoms yet.

If you're not taking anterior PAs regularly, I would encourage you to do so. Our policy is that clients do them once a year. If you're still taking bitewings once a year, it might be a good idea to transition into taking films more frequently. For example, you could do bitewings at one visit and anterior PAs at the other: So patients are getting an exposure of some kind every six months. With high-risk patients, we have gone to bitewings every six months.

# Overcoming Objections to X-rays

A small percentage of patients will give you resistance to the X-rays and may decline them. Often when patients ask: "Didn't I have X-rays last time?" they aren't saying 'no' to X-rays. They’re just saying that this is something new and different.

There is a short video on the blog showing an example of handling objections to X-rays.

All we have to do is explain that last time we took X-rays of their posterior teeth and this time we will be doing their anterior teeth. Sometimes you can explain to a patient that for these reasons, they are considered high risk and we should take them every six months: They are usually fine with that.

# Other circumstances for radiographic examination

The ADA 2005 guidelines added a category of 'other circumstances that would justify radiographic examination. This category is:

- Including, but not limited to, proposed or existing implants,
- pathology,
- restorative/endodontic needs,
- treated periodontal disease and caries remineralization.

So we now have more clarity on when we should be following up with radiographs especially periapicals on certain issues.

# Periapicals

What is recommended?

- With anterior PAs, we recommend once a year
- Where there are planned crowns, we recommend taking the PA that day if time permits: A current PA may be needed for insurance purposes and we are in a difficult situation if this is not available and the claim isn’t paid
- Follow up post-endodontic treatment once a year
- Follow up post-implant procedures5 once a year (recommended for first three years after implant is placed)

# Leaving Money on the Table

If we are not doing these PAs, we are leaving serious money on the table. Most of the time this money comes from the insurance companies. Clearly, that's not why we take the X-rays and I'm not recommending taking unnecessary films: But I do recommend taking a close look at the ADA guidelines and making a judgment based on your patient base and each individual case once they are in the chair.

Are they high-risk and if so have we adjusted our protocols for that patient? If the tooth is broken and needs a crown, we need that PA and it's covered by the insurance so we may as well be reimbursed for the work we are doing: The only PA we don't charge for is the post-endodontic treatment the day the endo is completed. Any other follow-up films we charge out. It's recommended that we do that:

Feel free to charge for what you do:

We sometimes wonder if we should charge or not charge. But when was the last time you went into a medical provider and they took an X-ray and didn't charge you? It doesn't happen! Feel free to charge for what you do.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

If you have a patient on a limited income, you can offer whatever courtesies you deem fit for your patients. It's up to you and the doctor.

We take 4 PAs a year:

- An anterior PA on the maxillary central and anterior
- A maxillary cuspid
- A mandibular 7 a lower PA

Usually we get a pretty good picture of all of these teeth when we take those PAs.

If you take more than that, if you take more than four bitewings and four PAs the same day, you run the risk of problems with insurance reimbursement.

If you alternate so that you do PAs on one visit and bitewings on the other, then you can take more than four.

# Limitations

Insurance companies will pay for PAs whenever they are deemed necessary. The biggest risk is taking too many on the same day.

# How much can it really be?

If we are talking about just one chair in hygiene, and we take just eight PAs a day above and beyond what we were going to take initially—that's a $40,000 increase in one year.

That's just two patients in the course of your day. Then add to that all the other PAs post-endo and post-implant and PAs on patients who need crowns.

# Let's do the math!

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

If our fee for PAs is $22 and we do an additional 10 of these per chair in a day, we are going to see an increase of $42,240 in a year per chair. It really adds up quickly so it's important we pay attention to X-rays.

"It really adds up quickly so it's important we pay attention to X-rays."

# Protect yourself!

50% of all malpractice cases are due to missed diagnosis. So if we don't have a process that screens patients even if the patient has signed a waiver refusing X-rays, it's been determined in a court of law that the dentist is still at fault. They have chosen to be a party to supervised neglect. So we have to be very careful. We need to keep this in mind and review our policies about X-rays.

# What does this mean for hygiene profitability?

If you have seven chairs in your practice and your team sets a goal of doing 10 additional unscheduled PAs a day, you have an increase of $295,000 for the practice over a year.

If you've been doing Bitewings once a year and you decide to go to every six months on the 95% of your patients that are high-risk, you just take your Bitewing production from last year and double that number. That gives you a pretty good idea of the potential increase to productivity and profitability, and it can be significant.

# Oral Cancer: the Forgotten Disease

Some great new tools have emerged that have enabled us as hygiene providers to take a good look at oral cancer in our screening process.

With oral cancer:

- One American dies from this disease every hour of every day
- It is one of the 10 most common cancers in the world
- It is a disease with high morbidity and mortality (according to the WHO)

# Oral Pre-cancer & Cancer

We're working every day with many regions that have an oral cancer risk. The oral cavity and oropharynx have many parts:

- Lips
- Lining of your cheeks
- Salivary glands (glands that make saliva)
- Roof of your mouth (hard palate)
- Back of your mouth (soft palate and uvula)
- Floor of your mouth (area under the tongue)
- Gums and teeth, tongue and tonsils

Sometimes it's helpful to know how to describe it to patients: The following may help:

Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the organs of the body.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Precancerous lesion is defined by an international working group as a "morphologically altered tissue" in which cancer is most likely to occur than its apparently normal counterpart: (Axell et al, 1984)

Sometimes this orderly process goes wrong: New cells form when the body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor.

Oral cancer is part of a group of cancers called head and neck cancers. It can develop in any part of the oral cavity or oropharynx. All oral cancers begin in the flat cells (squamous cells) that cover the surfaces of the mouth, tongue, and lips. These cancers are called squamous cell carcinomas. They have a high morbidity and mortality rates.

Oral cancer is one of the few conditions that dental professionals may encounter which can be fatal. So it's important that we pay attention to oral cancer and are looking at the common sites.

# Oral Cancer Common Sites

- Cancer of Lip
- Cancer of Tongue
- Cancer of Mouth
- Cancer of Pharynx

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Many of us have been doing a visual screening with patients to determine if there are any cysts, lumps, abnormalities or anything that doesn't seem normal:

# Facts about oral cancer

- Disease is twice as common in men than in women
- Majority of malignancies are squamous cell carcinoma
- Incidence increases with age
- Regional variations occur
- Socio-economic inequalities exist in oral cancer rates
- If detected early, 90% of all oral cancer is curable

It is curable not just treatable. So, because we still see a high mortality and high morbidity rate from oral cancer, we’re just not detecting it early enough:

"Because we see a high mortality rate from oral cancer, we're just not detecting it early enough:⁹³"

# Who should be screened?

In the past, it was recommended that screening should be done for people with the traditional high risk profile: heavy tobacco users and alcohol users. But now it's recommended that all adults 18 yrs and older have annual screenings.

There are many trends in our society that are leading to this rise. But one of the most gratifying things about being in dentistry is that we have technology increasing at lightning speed and we can serve our patients better than ever:

We now have several ways to detect cancerous lesions before they reach the surface.

# Vizilite and VELscope

Vizilite is an easy way to start offering these services without a large investment.

The cost for the doctor is around $19 per patient.

With VELscope, the cost for the light unit is around $4995. But once you have the light unit there is nothing further to buy.

These lights use a chemi-luminescent light source much like they do with pap smears and cervical screening:

So the same technology that has been used for years to reduce the death rate from cervical cancer is now available in dentistry.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Keys to Increasing Oral Cancer Screening Acceptance

Here are some ways to increase your acceptance rates for cancer screening:

- New research shows 90% of all oral cancer is curable if caught early.
- Cancer Society recommends all adults 18 yrs and older get screened once a year.
- We have amazing new technology similar to what is used for cervical cancer screening - less invasive, more comfortable.
- We need to help people understand that oral cancer screenings are just as important as the other cancer screenings they go to their physician for:

This is why you should have one today:

- It just takes a few minutes during your appointment.
- We know that prevention is important to you.

In order to help our patients recognize the value of this screening, we have a special offer during your appointment today.

Practices are typically charging a fee of $65-85 for a screening if they have a Vizilite or VELscope. But the technology is no good unless we are using it and that's where special offers can be great:

You can suggest that the doctor will cover part of the cost if they try the Vizilite.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Screening today: "We are offering the screening for $35 today: We split the difference with you.25

This helps build value for the service, helps the patient take advantage of their time in the office and gives them a reason to have it done next time. Once they have it done once, it becomes an annual screening:

The key message is that 90% of oral cancer is curable if we catch it early enough and now we have the technology to be able to catch it before it progresses.

On the website: Video of oral cancer survivor talking of experiences.

In the past we had to wait for it to come to the surface to see it with our eyes and too often it wasn't soon enough:

If you are providing a more advanced cancer screening service, it helps you know your patients are getting the best service you can provide:

# Questions

# Answers from the Session

1. In our experience, the PAs usually go to the deductible. What do you suggest?

I think it's rare that PAs go to the deductible: Usually diagnostics are paid 100% in the preventive category. But even if that's the case, if they're necessary, you should still take the PAs. Chances are if the patient is high-risk they will have to pay that deductible one way or the other.

You should explain to the patient that you have noticed something that may become a problem later but that you can catch it now while it is smaller. If they wait it could take more time and cost more money to take care of it; even if you have to write some off occasionally when they are not covered the overall extra production to the practice makes the process of taking x-rays worthwhile.
2. Is there a special code for anterior PAs?

We just charge them out as four PAs. Usually there is a code for the first and it's different for the additional ones.
3. How often should we be taking full-mouth PAs?

Every 3-5 years is the normal recommendation of the ADA. A lot of insurance companies are going for 3 years. In my practice, if it's a high-risk patient we do it every 3 years regardless of what the insurance company says.
4. How often should the advanced oral cancer screening be done?

The American Cancer Society recommends they are done once a year.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# 5.

For perio maintenance patients, do you recommend vertical bitewings and if so do you recommend four or six films? The ideal series in my view is seven vertical bitewings. This gives us a more accurate picture of where the bone levels are. The challenge is that a lot of the sensors made for digital X-rays are not comfortable placed in that vertical arena: It's difficult to find vertical bitewing holders that allow us to do that comfortably.

# 6.

Do oral surgeons use the Vizilite to diagnose? I know some do. It's a great tool for initial screening: But by the time someone is referred to an oral surgeon they may be ready for a biopsy: In the UK most patients don't have insurance. We offer a plan and it's hard to decide what to have on the plan and what to leave off. Try to establish what services would be ideal for the typical patient. Then if you have some services that are unique or would be suited to high-risk patients, make these at a higher fee. Those patients who are high-risk can decide whether to pay the higher fee. In the US, many practices are moving away from the insurance model and going to fees. The majority of patients are willing to pay out of pocket for prevention: They realize that investing now will save them time and money later.

# 8

With all these additional services do we need to increase the length of the hygiene appointment? In later sessions, we'll be talking about how to streamline the exam process and how to utilize our time as effectively as possible. We schedule 60 minutes for a recall hygiene service and, with a healthy patient, we have plenty of time to include all these services.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

If a patient refuses the cancer screening, are we still liable for not catching the cancer earlier? Only the courts can decide this but in California a patient accepted a cancer screening and then had the claim denied by their insurer. The patient was found to have oral cancer and sued the insurance company. It was determined the insurance company should have paid for the test: As a result more insurance companies are now including this service in their cover.

Our role is to do a thorough examination to the best of our ability. If patients decline, we can have them sign a disclaimer but we don't know if that will hold up in court:

# 5 Rs for Explosive Hygiene

This session looks at the systems we need to have in place to support us down the path towards increasing production numbers. It covers the 5 Rs for explosive hygiene. You'll recognize that these systems are important in your role as a hygienist even though some of the tasks may be performed by others in the practice such as the hygiene coordinator or the front desk:

The fact is that your own productivity is sometimes outside your control as a lot of it depends on the schedule. So we'll be covering the key systems that need to be in place to encourage the continual growth of the hygiene department:

The first three keys we'll be looking at are:

- Recall: Patients who are DUE for their hygiene visits
- Recovery: Filling open time in the schedule e.g.: today or tomorrow
- Re-activation: Scheduling patients that are OVERDUE and have been for some time

The big mistake I see in practices all over the world is that too often we use the same strategies for all of these issues.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Keeping the Schedule Full in Uncertain Times

We all have significant challenges facing us right now but that doesn’t mean we can't be successful.

We need to have everybody on the same page and have the right strategies in place so that we are sure we are maximizing the potential from hygiene.

# In these uncertain times, we need to keep our finger on scheduling efficiency

We want to stay efficient so that we can stay off the hygiene roller-coaster.

# The Hygiene Roller-coaster

Many of us have been on the hygiene roller-coaster and it's not a fun place to be. It happens when:

- The schedule is too "full"
- We don't have open time for weeks, even months
- Scheduling periods is a challenge
- Scheduling new patients is a challenge

But then the day before or the day of the appointment; there is fallout and the schedule is wide open:

It then becomes extremely challenging to recover this time, especially if we are talking the day of the appointment:

That's when scheduling efficiency becomes so important:

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Getting Off the Hygiene Roller-Coaster

The reasons we want to get off the hygiene roller-coaster are that:

- Constant open time in hygiene is frustrating
- It causes conflict within the team
- It is an ever-ending task
- There is very little job satisfaction

Constant up-and-down with the hygiene schedule can be extremely frustrating.

No battle is ever won without a strategy. Keeping the schedule full is a significant battle and we need to have the right strategy.

This is often what is lacking when we are dealing with open time, and last-minute cancellations in hygiene: It's a daily battle where we sometimes feel defeated and that we don't have the capability to win. We often approach the situation as one we cannot change.

We have to believe we can win and it's often the strategy that's missing. So we talk about the strategy that's needed: We need to know our role as hygienists in order to continue having good profitability.

# Consider your opponents

As in any battle, we need to know who the adversary is. We don't want to think of patients as opponents but sometimes they appear that way for example when they call to cancel.

The problem is that many patients have been let off the hook too easily in the past. Our office policies have trained our patients to act this way.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

For example there are some nasty phrases that are often used at the front desk when someone calls to cancel such as: "That's OK". We should never say this when someone calls at the last minute to cancel: It's important to know what to say and who to go to.

So one of the first questions is: Who is your General? In a battle you need to have a firm leader, a go-to person. That's why the role of Hygiene Coordinator is vital in all practices no matter the size.

"Our office policies have trained our patients to act this way:" This does not have to be the only role for this person if you only have five people on your team, you don't need an independent hygiene coordinator. But someone needs to be in charge! They need to have the hygiene schedule as their priority.

# Hygiene Coordinator

The hygiene coordinator is the person within your team who:

- Knows strategies to win the battle
- Feels the urgency in crisis situations: Usually the problem is nobody has the top priority of filling a gap in the schedule
- Main recruiter: They find someone on the team who can solve the problem
- Directs the troops: They may not solve the problem personally but they make sure someone does
- The team member in charge of Recall, Recovery and Reactivation strategies

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# #1: Recall Strategy

#1: Every patient should leave with an appointment

Some 'experts' say you should not pre-schedule patients but if you do not pre-schedule, it is practice suicide. You will end up having to rebuild your practice almost from the ground up in a year or two.

The best place to schedule the next hygiene appointment is in the chair with the hygienist.

It's 65% more successful when the follow-up appointment is scheduled in the back with the hygienist.

We need to make sure that our dialogue is smooth enough to convince every patient that this is the best way to ensure their future health:

When someone says "Just send me a card" I smile at them and say:

"You know, we just don't do it that way any more. Let me tell you what works so much better for our patients:

But tell them how they stand to benefit by pre-scheduling their appointment not how it benefits the practice.

This should be audited on a monthly basis.

Our pre-scheduled rate should be 90% or higher.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Recall Pre-scheduling Audit

Most of us will need the help of the office manager or front desk team leader in running these reports as they will be more familiar with running them on a day to day basis. Here are the steps:

1. Run the Continuing Care report for 6 months from the month you just finished. So in October run the report for April of the following year.
2. This report can be set up to show patients who are due in that future month that HAVE appointments.
3. It will also show you patients who are due in that future month who DO NOT HAVE appointments.
4. Then take the number who do not have appointments and divide it by the number who do have appointments.
5. This number gives you the percentage of patients who did not pre-schedule.

This pre-scheduling audit should be done monthly and could be done by the hygiene coordinator with the help of the front desk: We have got to be pre-scheduling our patients and this lets us know how well we are doing:

# #2: Recall cards mailed

We have to mail out some form of recall card 2-3 weeks ahead. We experimented with having them printed off on the computer. But we found it was more effective when patients addressed the cards to themselves.

When they see it in their own handwriting it goes to the top of the pile.

Make sure you are sending updated cards that have a good message.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Here's a good example.

# FOUR SEASON

It says "This time has been reserved exclusively for you: If you are unable to keep the appointment, please give us a call so we may reschedule." It also mentions the oral cancer exam we want to build value for the services provided in the appointment. And the front is high quality creating a personalized message that builds strong value for your hygiene services.

# #3: The silver bullet for recall One week calls

Many of us use Smile Reminder or some other type of electronic messaging system. They are a great addition to what we are currently doing but they are not designed to replace what we do.

Too often clients say they have quit calling to confirm because they are using Smile Reminder. But that's not the idea behind those services. They are designed to be an additional help, not to replace what you are currently doing:

This one step can have a powerful impact on your personal schedule.

We add a ONE WEEK AHEAD courtesy phone call for any patients who have been scheduled a few months previously. For anyone who was scheduled last time they were here, we make this one week ahead phone call.

We say something like:

"Hi this is Wendy calling from Global Dental Care. This is your one week ahead courtesy reminder: We have you scheduled for Thursday at 10 am. We just want to make sure you got your postcard and to let you know we're looking forward to seeing you then."

If the patient cannot keep the visit, they will let you know. This minimizes last-minute changes to the schedule. We're trying to eliminate the patients who can't make it but just haven't got around to calling us.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

But do not count them as confirmed until you have made the confirmation call the day before. When you make the one week ahead call, tell them you will be calling them again the day before. Letting them know this will minimize complaints. If the patient says "No need to call, I'll be there" you can count them as confirmed but don't ask them whether they want a call the day before.

# #4: Giving patients a reason to come back

Anything we can do to give them a reason to come back builds value to the visit. The cancer screening is a good example of this. The Whitening for Life program also gives people a powerful reason to return: "Letting them know you are going to call will minimize complaints."

You should offer this to everyone. Once patients are enrolled, be sure to enter WFL into the continuing care and/or flag the patient's account so that we can monitor how well we are doing: If the patient has ZOOM! they are automatically enrolled in WFL.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Patient Retention

It's really important that we serve our patients well when they are with us. 65% of your patients leave because of perceived service problems.

Do you have an issue with patients not wanting to come in?

Do you know why your patients don't want to come back?

Communication skills are vital to our success. Too often we are leaving the wrong message:

For example:

"This is Wendy calling from ABC Dental Care. We've been going through our records and we've established that it's been six months since your last check up and cleaning: We know that prevention is important to you so the doctor has asked me to give you a call because he's concerned."

None of that works. It's not effective.

We're told that we should catch people at home between 4pm and 8pm. But we live in a very fast-paced world: A lot of our patients are not at home in the evenings. Even if they are at home they may have caller ID and not want to be disturbed.

What's important is not the time you call people but the message you leave:

The message is the key to the success of your recall efforts. The whole point of the message is to generate a return phone call.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

So here's what you should be saying instead:

"This is Angelina calling from ABC Dental Care, it is important that you call me as soon as possible regarding your appointment."

That's all you need to say. You'll be astounded at how many people call you back:

They will call you back because as soon as they get that message, they'll be thinking: "What appointment; I don't have an appointment".

So when they call and say that; the person answering the phone should smile and say:

"I know! That's why I called. I called to help you set up your appointment."

It works amazingly well. Some people think the patient might be angry but the secret is to respond to them in a positive manner: "I'm so glad you called."

Usually patients will go ahead and schedule or else they'll let us know why they aren't ready. Either way, we've got what we want. We know their status so we can serve them better and provide the care they need.

The message becomes the most important part of the recall process.

# Using code names

For large practices, when a lot of people are making these calls, we've found it can be a good idea to use code names. For example, we always leave a message saying "When you call back, please ask for Paula." That means whoever answers the phone immediately knows it's a recall message.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# #2: Recovery Strategy

The most important secret of a successful recovery strategy if you have open time today or tomorrow is Don't Start with the Lists!

Too often we go to the same lists: Recall, Overdue, Unscheduled, Broken Appointments when we have open time.

But think about who's on those lists - it's usually people who've failed to keep to an appointment in the past: If they're long overdue, they may have no desire to come in.

So the odds aren't very good if we work with those lists. We shouldn't ignore these lists. But if our objective is recovery, these lists are not the place to start.

We want to start somewhere that gives us a better chance of success.

# First line of attack: ASAP lists

The best place to start is your ASAP (As Soon As Possible) lists. Most practices are not using their software adequately for this feature.

You should ask every patient when they're scheduling: "If we get something that opens up sooner, would you like to know?"

Dentrix allows you to check a box for ASAP on their record if they want notice of earlier appointments. Most other software has a similar feature.

But what we don't do is actually generate that list:

We want to ask the question and record what people say. Then when we

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

have an opening, that list is the first place we go.

The people who have already committed to an appointment are going to give us the best odds of success when we're trying to fill that last-minute open time.

# What not to say.

"We had a cancellation for this afternoon. It would really help us out if you could come in. The doctor hates to have open time in the schedule, and this is the third cancellation today."

'Cancellation' is a word to avoid. It's better to talk about last-minute changes. This sends a completely different message:

# What you should say.

"When we scheduled your appointment, you asked me to call if something else became available sooner. We had a last minute change to the schedule for this afternoon, and the first person I thought of was you."

With this approach, the patient feels singled out and special. These patients are very happy to come in.

When you take their initial appointment, you can note if they have a special time or if they have insurance limitations.

# Second line of attack: Next week's schedule

The second line of attack is next week's schedule. We start by looking at the same day and time next week. So if we have an opening this Tuesday at 10am, we look first at who's scheduled for next Tuesday at 10am.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Chances are if that time works for them next week; it will work for them this week:

To avoid insurance limitations, you can schedule follow-up appointments for 6 months and 2 weeks ahead. That allows you more flexibility to bring that appointment forward but have it still more than six months after the last one.

You may find your computer automatically books people for six months in the future but it's a good idea to try and change the default setting:

New patients and perio maintenance or scaling and root planing patients are also good to look for when we are trying to move patients forward as we are not limited by insurance issues.

# Third line of attack: Today's schedule

An effective morning huddle can help everybody perform to the best of their ability and one thing that's important to go over is who's in the schedule today that has hygiene service needs. Or who's in the schedule today that has treatment planned that has not yet been completed.

If we all communicate, we can serve the patients better:

So coordinating the troops is important and the morning huddle is a good way of doing that.

# Fourth line of attack: Other lists

The last place we go is to our lists Broken Appointments, Recalls, Unscheduled Treatment: Too often we fail because we go to the lists first. Using these other approaches gives a much greater chance of success.

# Building your list

The first key to building your list is using your software: Many people think "We just know who is overdue" but you can’t keep it all in your head.

So use your software and the options it provides to help you:

If everyone on the team works together and we all know where the list is, anyone who has 10 minutes to spare can easily make some calls. When the list is easily available, people are much more likely to do that:

# #3: Reactivation Strategy

Knowing the difference between Reactivation and Recall is key - Recall is patients who are overdue but fairly recently overdue. Reactivation is after 18 months of overdue time and, once we get into reactivation mode, the strategies are very different.

It takes an average of 4-5 attempts average before you are successful with reactivation. So it's important that you know what your strategy is. Is your strategy a phone call every once in a while when you can get around to it?

We need to have a clearly-defined campaign. It helps to have someone specific on the team in charge of a reactivation campaign. You might have the hygiene coordinator in charge of recovery and recall but reactivation may suit someone who is more comfortable with marketing: So if you have a marketing assistant or a dental assistant who would like a special project during downtime it could suit them.

The campaign needs to be established by the doctor and the team leader so that the person doesn't have to come up with all the ideas on their own.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Example campaign

- Letter
- Phone Call
- Postcard
- Phone Call
- Lumpy Mail Item

Sending creative letters works better at getting people's attention than the same old boring letters. One great example was a postcard with a picture of a search helicopter with the message: "Call Out The Coastguard, Wendy Briggs Has Gone Missing!"

One client shared with us that they used this message and added a model of a parachute guy and put it in an envelope and turned it into a lumpy mail item. When people go to their mailboxes and there's something in a lumpy envelope, it gets opened first.

You can also use Whitening for Life as a reactivation offer.

# Be Creative

Here's an example of a postcard sent out by one practice. It has a photo of the hygienist with the message: "I looked for you in the chair and you weren't there. I sure hope you are OK! I really miss you."

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

This postcard got a huge positive response and the main reason was that it was personal. It created a little bit of a guilt trip because people realized that it's not just the procedures they book, they book them with a person.

# Lumpy mail ideas

- Tube mailing with offer: Mailing was sent out with a toothbrush in a clear tube. It contained an offer saying the first 10 patients that called could exchange the toothbrush for a power toothbrush when they came in (It was a Simple $5 Braun model): This worked very well because it gave patients a reason to call.
- Aspirin with offer: This was sent out as a 3rd or 4th mailing after the patient had not responded to previous messages. A small foil pack of aspirin was taped to the front of an envelope with the message: "We don’t mean to be a headache but we're trying to get in touch with you: If we are causing you a headache, please take this aspirin and call us in the morning."
- Tree in a Box com: This can be sent out to people who have uncompleted treatment: The message is: Just like this tree, sometimes small things can grow into a big problem.

Other examples shared by clients included sending a message in a bottle (www.ebottles.com) and a plastic silver platter with a letter on top. So be creative, patients appreciate it and it helps you get your message across.

# #4: Restorative Coordinator

There’s a lot of unscheduled treatment out there; our audits show it's typically about $3 million per doctor:

Too often when patients leave, they leave so it makes sense to have a strategy to follow them up. Often patients will appreciate having this followed up.

One effective strategy is having a restorative coordinator: They:

- Handle restorative schedule
- Confirm restorative schedule
- Make it priority one when open time
- Follow up with unscheduled treatment

# Insurance Campaign

Running close to the end of the year is a good time to run a campaign on unscheduled treatment to remind patients that they may have insurance maximums. Many patients are unaware that they may lose benefits that are unused before the year end:

It's very easy to send out some letters or postcards and follow these up with some phone calls to follow up on unscheduled treatment:

If you're in a situation where production is down, sending out a campaign encouraging people to use up their insurance maximum is a great way of generating more treatment:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Binder of Unscheduled Treatment

Having a binder of unscheduled treatment like our recall list makes it easy to make phone calls.

From this point on, copy any financial estimates that are not scheduled and put them in a 3-ring binder.

It's most effective to color-code it:

- Green: We are pretty sure patient is going to go ahead with treatment
- Yellow: Patient may have some objections that have not been overcome or questions they need answered or they may have hesitations such as financing
- Red: Usually signifies there's not much point in pursuing it; perhaps we weren't a good fit or we weren't on their insurance plan

The reason for having these color codes is that if you only have a few minutes, you want to use your time in the best manner possible. So you want to concentrate your efforts on the patients most likely to schedule:

# Use the 2/2/2 Ratio

From the binder:

- Follow up after 2 days
- Then follow up again after 2 weeks
- Then follow up again after 2 months

This has proven to be an effective formula for getting patients to come in.

# #5: Referral Strategy

When people receive a personal request for referrals, they almost feel obligated to comply.

So have you invited your patients to send referrals your way? Too often we're not asking for the referrals. Yet two-thirds of the US economy is driven by word-of-mouth marketing:

There's also the Law of the Few: 10% influence the purchasing behavior of the other 90%.

92% of consumers prefer word-of-mouth recommendation.

So if we're striving for more referrals, we have to look at what's different about our practice. If we can't think of anything dramatically different; maybe we need to create something.

# How impressive are we?

We've got to be willing to take a good look at how impressive we are. We've used mystery patients and videos (with permission) to discover a lot about how things look from the patient's side.

We've also got to be willing to ask some pretty tough questions:

- Were you completely happy with your visit today?
- Did we exceed your expectations today?

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Whenever you get a positive comment, this is a great time to ask for referrals!

Handing them a Care-to-Share card is also powerful:

# Referral Awards Programs

Award programs that are concrete and in writing can also work well: However, in some states providing any type of monetary compensation to patients is not permitted. Awards should increase in value with number of referrals. Some patients will be very loyal referral generators.

# Referral Contest

- Annual contests are very effective and quarterly ones also work well.
- The contest can be based on performance or as a draw.
- All patients get excited about the program and winners become devoted.
- Points systems can work well too, especially where state rules are restrictive.
- Patients can redeem their points against a range of rewards of increasing value.
- Rewards can also be against future treatment.
- If they are interested in ZOOM! Let them earn it by sending referrals.

# Questions & Answers from the Session

# 1. What do you do with patients who consistently fail appointments?

We have a three-strikes-and-you're-out policy. If they fail three times, we put them on a special list where they are not given a scheduled appointment: We call them when there is a last-minute gap in the schedule. You have to be in charge of your schedule: We want to serve our patients well but it doesn't make sense to accommodate repeat offenders at the expense of other patients and the profitability of the practice.

# 2. Do you do sealants on primary teeth?

Yes you can though bear in mind you often won't get reimbursement from insurance companies. I suggest it's up to the parents to decide. If you do the sealants, make sure the parents know there still needs to be flossing: Also you should etch just a few seconds longer than you would for permanent teeth as it's more difficult to get the sealants to stay.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Streamlining Systems

The feedback from previous sessions has been showing a general picture of steady production increases as we move towards the objective of maximizing the potential from hygiene in your practice:

We have seen some great days like doing 30 sealants in the practice: We love to celebrate those but overall it's important to focus on the little steps we are taking every day to serve our patients better and cause our production to go up.

The more you present opportunities to your patients, the more they will accept them as your skills continue to improve.

Stay focused and you'll see even more impact:

# Smoothing the Flow

This session focuses on the keys to smoothing the flow of the exam process.

There are many common frustrations:

- "We struggle with getting it all done in a timely manner and staying on time."
- Fitting in all the extra services can be a challenge:
- "We need help with the flow of the exams. Once the doctor steps in the room, it's beyond our control to keep everything flowing efficiently."
- "Our production is down right now because the economy is down; and our patients don't have any money."

We hear these frustrations from many of our members. So, if you've felt them, you are not alone.

©2014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

We"Il cover these issues and the steps we can take to help us along the way:

There are other frustrations we hear about when we talk about streamlining the system:

"The doctor wonders why no one seems to hear when they have been asked to PLEASE have the intra-oral photos taken and displayed prior to the exam"

Everything seems good in principle but sometimes making it happen in reality is not so easy:

From providers, we hear:

"The patient feels rushed through the exam after waiting 10 minutes for the doctor in the first place"

So how do we streamline the process and get the results we are looking for?

Other issues we hear about include:

- The assistants and hygienists are frustrated that it took FOREVER to get the doctor in hygiene in the first place, now they can't get the Doctor OUT!
- "We have an abundance of new technology in our practice, but are struggling to use it all. We just don't have time."
- "It doesn\'t fit within our system so somebody else will have to do it."

In this session we look at the keys to overcoming some of these issues and enable everyone in the team to be more effective.

# Keys to Smoother Exam Flow

# Key #1: Take the time to do a Patient Interview

Whether it's an existing patient or a new patient, if we're not asking some key questions, we're going to be running short on time at the end. It's much more valuable to ask those questions at the start of the appointment rather than at the end of the process when the doctor comes in and we're trying to get through the exam.

A patient interview is absolutely vital. This is where we learn exactly what the patient is struggling with, what their concerns are. It's an essential part of the new patient experience: It will determine whether there is going to be a long-term relationship with the practice.

We've created a rating sheet which measures 65 points of contact with every new patient: That's:

|A patient|66|
|---|---|
|65 ways to give them the WOW!|interview is|
|absolutely|vital.|
|65 ways we can earn|& failing grade|

The new patient interview is a very important part of the new patient experience.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It's all about taking time to ask the patient:

- What they came in for
- What their prior experience was
- What they are hoping to accomplish with us today
- What we can do to serve them better

These questions should not just be reserved only for new patients. Our goal is that every single patient who comes in for an examination should have an interview.

We cannot compete on price and succeed. It's all about the experience our patients are having when they come in for treatment.

The goal of any patient experience is to have the patient move forward with treatment: Asking the key questions as part of this process is important:

# The Old Paradigm

The old paradigm can be described as "adversarial selling" = We base the entire treatment plan on a presumed need: We see what's wrong so we tell them what needs to be done.

But in this process, we're not paying attention to what the patient is asking us for. We haven't taken the time to ask them what their goals are:

So it doesn't deliver the results we want; because it doesn't deliver the results the patient wants.

It doesn't produce loyal patients. Patients can often leave feeling frustrated and they don't schedule to come back because we spent all this time going over treatment they have no interest in.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# The New Paradigm

We ask our key questions then listen. We identify what we have on our service menu that may be a potential match with the patient's goals.

When we start asking the questions and trying to decide if something is a good fit for the patient's challenge, we minimize the time wasted on blind presentations. We end up customizing treatment options based on what each patient is asking for.

This doesn't mean we can't go over any needs we see that don't directly fit the patient's desires or what they've mentioned but we may need to direct their thought process with the questions we ask:

This process is much more effective because it respects the patient's and clinician's time much more.

# We customize treatment options based on what patient asks for:

# Asking WORKS!

# Telling DOESN'T!

We have to initiate a delicate balancing act as hygienists. We have to ask the questions in such a way that we can tell them what our findings are in a way that satisfies what they've expressed interest in.

So before going to all the time and trouble of presenting a treatment plan, we make sure it is the right one. Trying to follow the same approach for everyone whether or not they fit is an exercise in frustration for everyone on the team.

"The key to maintaining long term relationships is always the willingness to pose intelligent questions about present and future plans."

# Key #2: Have Diagnostic Data Gathered And Ready To Go

The technology available makes it great being a hygienist today; we have some amazing tools at our fingertips.

We've had a whole session on digital x-rays so have you changed your policy? Have you taken the time to look for the opportunities for additional X-rays like the ADA recommended when they changed their policies in 2005?

The potential increase in production if you add 10 PAs a day in hygiene is 842,240 a year. Stay focused on those post-operative PAs after endo and implants. Anterior PAs should also be done usually at least once a year.

There are plenty of opportunities to incorporate this technology as a win-win-win: It benefits the patient; the practice and the hygiene provider: It's an easy sale for many patients as the cost is usually covered by insurance. But even when it's not, many patients will go for them if you focus on the benefits to them.

We need to keep our mindset in the right place and utilize our new technology to serve our patients better.

# Why the Diagnodent is a Powerful Tool

One of the main values of the Diagnodent is not as a diagnostic tool. It's about patient perception of the benefits and value.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Too often doctors have purchased a Diagnodent and it sits in the corner gathering dust because they don't have a process for making use of it. If you truly want to maximize your role in the prevention process, a Diagnodent or some type of cavity-detecting laser is worth every penny of the investment: Patients are impressed by this Amazing Technology.

The hygienist or hygiene assistant or auxiliary should have already taken the readings prior to doctor entering: Then the readings are reviewed with the doctor: But it's not necessarily about what the numbers say - it's what the patients say when you use it: It can be an extremely valuable tool. For example, it can really help us do more sealants on adults. It's great for identifying treatment that may have been passed over otherwise.

A major advantage of the Diagnodent is that it gives us numbers we can use with the visuals. Here for example, we can say the groove on the top gave a reading of 23. That means there's most likely decay there so we're going to go ahead and open it up. You can then use the mid-procedure photos after the work has been prepped out to show the patient how much damage there was.

---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It becomes part of the visual proof when you are talking with patients.

Here's another example of teeth that gave us a reading with the Diagnodent:

We prepped the teeth and took a reading and then took another photo.

Using the Diagnodent in this way is a useful way of adding value into the process.

It streamlines the exam process because it reduces the amount of time we have to spend trying to explain why we think there's a cavity there.

It becomes supportive proof for the conditions we see.

Then it's always great to show a picture of what it looks like when it's all complete:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Key# 3: Use Images to Replace Wordy Descriptions when Discussing Potential Treatment

We already talked about using digital K-rays and radiographic images but another valuable tool is the intra-oral camera:

One of the key frustrations I hear from doctors is:

"We just don’t have time to use the camera: Often the photos are just not being taken. So we’ll cover how to incorporate the camera into your system."

The real value of the camera is that we provide visual proof to the patient of their condition.

"Instead of trying to explain why we’ve done for years: 'You’ve got a crack around your filling; a good-sized chunk of your tooth has broken off, you’ve got some dark staining in the pits and grooves.'

Instead of trying to give a verbal explanation, why not just show them because sometimes things get lost with only verbal communication.

If all we have is verbal communication, patients may not always be exactly clear on what you are saying:

A huge crack to them may not be the same as it is to you:

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The best way to illustrate this is through the story of when my husband came in and said: "There's a HUGE snake in the garden!" Immediately I'm visualizing a huge snake! We don't live in an area where that was very likely and the reality was very different. This was the HUGE snake.

The reason it was a huge snake is that we don't get them very often. But can you see how his words "huge snake" can mean two different things to each one of us?

So using the camera we don't have to rely on these verbal descriptions. All of a sudden the patients can see for themselves what the conditions really are.

# Ideal use of the Camera

The hygienist or hygiene assistant gives the patient a "Virtual Tour" of their teeth. We may be using the camera on new patients and not using it at all with existing and recall patients. Even though it takes time it will save you time.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It helps streamline the exam process and helps make things flow more smoothly: It's going to save us valuable time at the end of the appointment because the patient is going to realize exactly what needs to be done.

What's interesting is how patients respond to the suggestion of a virtual tour: Usually they are impressed because, even if they've seen the camera before, it's not been presented to them in that way.

# Challenge:

Use the camera this week and explain to patients that you are going to give them a virtual tour of their teeth: Of course we can freeze frame a few shots and give copies to the patient:

Especially highlight any teeth I had reading with the Diagnodent.

In this example, instead of trying to describe the stains, the patient can see it for themselves. They will respond very powerfully to the picture: "That looks disgusting!"

This is the tooth that scored a 34 with the cavity detecting laser. Scanning the teeth and letting them see just takes minutes. If there are several problem teeth, highlight the three worst; or the patient's chief complaint: Keep them in the permanent record or hand a copy to the patient if you can.

When the photo is up on the screen, all you have to say is "HUMMM." Pretty soon the patient says: "What's the problem?" They ask you for the information and that's valuable because they perceive it less as a sales tool.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Use it on every patient. If we only use the intra-oral camera on new patients, we're wasting it: We're not utilizing it as it could be used.

There's a video on the blog of us using the intra-oral camera with a patient outlining the words we use and the way they respond. Every patient deserves to see what's going on in their mouth. Patients are impressed by it and they value it. It helps create a sense of urgency because the patient is alerted of a problem. We have PROOF!

So using the camera actually saves time! The camera combined with the Diagnodent packs a really powerful punch.

We've had patients coming to us for a second opinion because they've been told by another office that they have six cavities. By the time they leave our office having got the readings and seen the images, they know they've got six cavities. Of course, they have us do the work to fix them because we were able to give them proof of the situation.

You can use the camera in less than five minutes.

What if you don't have a good camera in hygiene? Not all practices have easy access to a good camera or Diagnodent in hygiene. So, if you're in that situation, you should initiate a conversation with the doctor about the value of these tools to see how you can get them available.

# Key #4 More Complete Transfers

Auxiliaries should be ready to transfer information as soon as the doctor comes in for the exam. The auxiliary could be the hygienist, dental assistant or hygiene assistant. The problem is that doctors often come in and try to read a hastily-written note and then do an exam virtually cold. But the whole conversation we had with the patient before the doctor comes in is all very valuable information.

Too often, we don't have a system for transferring this information effectively to the doctor. We should have this information summarized and ready to go as soon as the doctor comes in. We should not alert the doctor to come in until we have all that diagnostic data gathered.

# Transfers Should Include

- Brief personal update: We don't want to be so focused on the task that we lose sight of who that patient is and why they are here. So we should have a brief personal update in front of the doctor; they've just returned from vacation or got a new job or whatever. It helps the patient realize we are interested in them and not just their MasterCard.
- Ask patient permission to fill the doctor in on what was discussed: This provides a clear signal to the patient that it is your turn to communicate with the doctor. That often prevents the patient from feeling that they have to participate in the conversation.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Discuss potential treatment and patient's desires in simple terms that patients can understand: This is the key to the transfer but it takes practice! We don't want to just talk about what we did and how the tissues look. We also want to include potential treatment options or any desires that the patient has shared with us.

It's very important that we communicate this verbally and don't just write it out on a Post-it note. If you have a form that you fill out, use it as a cheat sheet for the verbal transfer. If it doesn't happen out loud, the patient doesn't know what was said.

Every time we verbalize it in front of the patient we are building value for the treatment options we have discussed.

# Complete handoffs prevent slide-offs!

# Slide-offs Happen When:

- We can't get the doctor out of the room
- We hear the doctor answering questions we already answered
- We hear the doctor going into way too much detail or discussing treatment options

Where we have incomplete transfers, we start losing ground and the momentum changes. Before we know it, we have lost our forward direction and are heading downhill; backwards and without control.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Causes of Slide-offs

Personal chatter at the end of examination sequence: This should be at the beginning: If we get into this at the end, it appears rude when we try to end it.

Too much detailed information: A big part of case acceptance is to keep the patient from getting confused or overwhelmed.

Too much time taken discussing multiple treatment options: We feel we have to give the patient every treatment option for their tooth: They don't know which option is best. They came to see us because we know what is best for them. Ask for their permission to suggest the most suitable option. If they don't know which option to choose, they won't choose any.

Auxiliary not prepared with essential data:

- Additional X-rays needed

We leave money on the table if we are not prepared and ready to go.

# Key # 5: Use your tools

When we want to add in extra procedures to the appointment; the challenge becomes getting it done on time. How do we possibly fit in sealants, desensitizing treatment and Whitening for Life and still find time to get everything else done? The answer to that question is to use your tools.

# Less is More!

# Less Handscaling, More Power Scalers!

We always tend to grab our power scalers when we see images like this with real heavy deposits. But often with the everyday patient; we think we can get it all done by hand and that we don't need to go for the power scalers.

"The paradigm changed in the early 1990s to support Ultrasonics as the instrument of choice for ALL dental hygiene procedures, recall and perio, for children and adults"
Dental Economics March 2007

This means we should go for the power tools first: We should follow the 80/20 rule where we use our power scalers 80% of the time and our hand scalers the remaining 20%. Too often we have this mentality that we can get it done by hand:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

the question is: Why would you want to? What are you trying to prove?"

But my G6 it done better and faster?

Why not use an instrument that will enable us to get it done better and faster?

Too often it's the other way around, We are doing it by hand 80% of the time.

There are strong reasons why we should be striving towards using power tools most of the time:

- Be more efficient
- Streamline our procedures
- Accomplish more in less time
- Minimize chair time for the patient
- More comfortable for the patient
- Don't HURT new patients

The tools we have now are so much better than they used to be. We can provide treatment very comfortably and without pain for our patients. Modern tools can provide the treatment without water overflow problems.

"Use of ultrasonics has been estimated to reduce the time required by 36.6%"

Journal of Clinical Periodontology 2002

Why would we not use an instrument that has been shown to reduce the time required that much? That's a lot of time in a 60 minute appointment.

# What does this mean for Hygiene Production?

If we can save just five minutes per patient: we can see up to 16 more adult patients a month!

OR

We can use that time more effectively to add same day preventive procedures to production.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

So it's worth taking time to look at what instruments you are using and how you are using them. If you follow the 80/20 rule, you'll find you do have time to incorporate the Diagnodent and the camera 5 and maybe even time for desensitizing or fluoride treatment.

# Realistic Expectations

# Phase One:

Data collection should take 10-20 minutes

# Phase Two:

Hygiene services should be done in under 30 minutes

Too often we schedule an hour regardless of what the patient needs. Some practices only take an X-ray once a year. So, on the other appointment; why do we still schedule an hour if we're not doing the exam and X-rays?

A model that works well for many offices is the 20/20/20 model.

- 20 minutes for data collection
- 20 minutes for instrumentation
- 20 minutes for exam and dismissal of patient

This model is designed to be firm in principle and flexible in procedure. You won't always need the full 20 minutes for data collection, so that allows more instrumentation time.

We need to make sure that we are coding procedures correctly. If we're running behind time, one of the main reasons may be that we're not coding and billing properly. We're not getting paid for what we are doing:

# Questions

# Answers from the Session

1. Should the doctor's exam be factored into total production for hygiene?
Typically the doctor's exam goes in doctor's production though some practices have that set up differently. Usually everything that happens in hygiene with the exception of the doctor's exam goes on hygiene production.
2. In data collection, are you including K-rays?
Yes. We include X-rays in that segment and when you have a full-mouth to be taken, it sometimes is tight: So the 20/20/20 model has to be flexible.
3. When we do a 20 minute prophy, do patients complain about a quickie cleaning?
Absolutely not: They are still in the chair for a full hour. If you were to ask them to choose between using the latest technology that will give them an exceptional cleaning in 20 minutes or doing it by hand and taking 45 minutes, they will choose the shorter one. They want a streamlined service.
4. What number on the Diagnodent suggests a cavity?
You have to decide this within your practice. Most of our members work on 20 or above for a cavity but some are more conservative and others more liberal.
5. How long do we stop with every new patient?
We allow 60 minutes for every new patient: However by the time they reach the hygiene chair, they’ve already been in the practice 20 minutes. All of the information has been gathered and put in the computer before they reach the chair. If their appointment in hygiene is at 11.00, we give them an appointment time of 10.40 rather than ask them to turn up early.

# Periodontal Paradigm

This session focuses on the role of the hygienist as the periodontal therapist: Periodontal therapist is one of the three key roles for the modern hygienist5 the others are preventive therapist and treatment advocate.

We'll evaluate the latest information about periodontal disease to help you provide great periodontal services to your patients.

Recent science has shown us more than ever before that:

Periodontal disease is not an oral condition. It's an oral manifestation of a systemic condition.

We're learning a lot more about the overall effect that periodontal disease has on a person's overall health and well-being:

So we have to ask ourselves: Are we doing the right thing by treating periodontal disease?

The reason this is important is that, if we don't, our patients won't believe in what we are doing, either, and they won't accept treatment.

So one of the vital aspects of a profitable and successful periodontal program is that we have to believe we are doing the right thing by treating periodontal disease early.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

So this session will help you evaluate what you think about periodontal and how to best service your patients in keeping this disease under control.

# Key facts

- More than 500 different species of bacterial pathogens are found in the mouth
- Plaques in the heart and plaques in periodontal disease have the same DNA

Dr Eric Bornstein DMD and Biochemist Tufts University

So if the patient has out-of-control plaque in the mouth, what do the valves of their heart look like?

The latest science and research we have available means we are now able to do more to help our patients than ever before:

# Periodontal Paradigm

Some questions we will be addressing in this session:

- What is your periodontal paradigm? Are you a 'supervised neglect' office or a 'prophy mill'? If you think you're doing well with perio, how do you know?
- What challenges are we facing for periodontal disease right now? Are patients going to want to pay for these services in this economy? Do they value them?
- Do they understand how serious a condition periodontal disease can be?
- Are we providing effective periodontal therapy? If we're still treating periodontal disease the same way we were five years ago, it's time for a wake-up call: A lot has changed.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Classification of Periodontal Disease

One of the biggest challenges with periodontal disease is in practices where we have more than one provider. Of course, we always have more than one provider: the hygienist and the dentist. Sometimes our biggest challenge is getting the hygienist and the dentist on the same page in regards to periodontal disease. But we have an even bigger challenge when we have more than one hygiene provider. It's often difficult to get everyone classifying periodontal disease in the same way.

So we have created a Periodontal Classification Worksheet to help overcome this challenge. This is the quickest and easiest way to get everyone on the same page and reduce the likelihood that a patient has seen another provider and had their condition classified in a different way.

# Probing and charting

Probing is often the missing step in periodontal care. It's been said that probing is dentistry's dirty little secret because we're not doing it as often as we should. We may do a little probing but we're often not taking readings and recording them. This can be challenging because time is often the issue. But you have to ask: Are we probing and charting every patient?

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

RDH magazine says only 30% of us are probing patients every six months. Probing when done correctly can help you with acceptance. Here are some tips on how to do it better.

- When possible before probing tell the patient what you are doing: Many of us are doing that but we need to be more specific.
- If you suspect perio is present, explain that there are warning signs of infection, and a full probe is needed:
- Even if you don't have someone helping you, saying the numbers out loud is important: It may seem strange but it is important so that the patients know what their readings are.
- I tell patients that anything lower than 3mm is healthy but anything more than 5mm means the infection has already spread into the bone. They recognize that's not good.

So if we're not probing our patients every six months and keeping a record we're missing out on a lot of potential perio.

# Obstacles

The biggest obstacles we run into when it comes to probing consistently and keeping a record of it are:

- Time
- No assistant available: We feel we have to do it all ourselves as hygienists but team members don't mind coming in to help us chart.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Computers: Many of us have computers in the operatory but we're still recording our probing depth by hand. We should be using the software.

We endeavor to do probing every six months but it should be a minimum of once a year. If we have a perio maintenance patient, we should have a complete record of charting every time that 4910 is billed out:

If we are not probing often enough, chances are we are doing too many prophies.

You might think they have 4 or 5 fours but; when you do the full charting; you might notice they have 28 fours.

So it's vital that we probe and keep a record if we want to make sure our periodontal program is healthy:

How many prophies are we doing?

It's important that we evaluate how many prophies we are doing and where we draw the line.

A lot of providers say they don’t want to be a prophy mill but, when we do the audit; that's exactly what's happening already.

They’re just not doing enough periodontal services. So the question arises:

When should we bill for more than a prophy?

Let's look at some of the definitions:

02014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Definitions for Oral Prophylaxis

"The removal of plaque, calculus and stain from exposed and unexposed surfaces of the teeth by scaling and polishing as a PREVENTIVE measure for the control of local irritational factors:"

American Academy of Periodontology

# The reality is:

74% of patients age 13-17 have sub-gingival calculus

90% of patients age 17+ have sub-gingival calculus

Institute of Dental Research

# The problem is

the definition doesn't mention sub-gingival: Once irritation has set in and we have gingival irritation and swelling, it's no longer a regular adult prophy:

# But here's more reality:

Just 10% of all sites examined had only supra gingival deposits

So we need to have sub-gingival scaling as part of our routine. It's unrealistic not to expect this. So that's no longer useful in helping us to define a prophy we used to be able to say if you go sub-gingival; it's no longer a prophy.

# More than 90% of all patients over the age of 13 have some form of periodontal disease

(NIDR study)

Most patients DO NOT have disease free mouths

But overwhelmingly 1110 healthy prophy is the code we use

# Definitions for Oral Prophylaxis

"Current definitions indicate that the prophy is performed on patients with normal healthy mouths to maintain health and PREVENT the initiation of dental diseases:"

American Dental Hygiene Association

02014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

So we have to shift the paradigm. We need to perform a complete assessment on every patient to determine what they need before performing a routine prophy. You might wonder if it is necessary to probe healthy patients every six months. But it is necessary to do this to complete a full assessment: It may not be necessary on a patient with absolutely no issues but we need to look at it patient-by-patient:

# Three Levels of Care

We're striving here to provide three levels of care:

- Preventive oral prophylaxis
- Therapeutic scaling and root planing
- Supportive periodontal maintenance

# When should we bill for a Prophylaxis?

We're talking about a preventive prophy: So we have to bill 1110:

- When there is health
- To prevent progression of disease
- To control local irritational factors

A prophy is not an option when:

- The disease process has started
- There is bone loss

So we have to take a close look at the codes we are using:

# Supervised Neglect?

Supervised neglect occurs too often in our community. More than 50% of all malpractice cases are undiagnosed or neglected perio.

02014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

If there are bleeding pockets: What are the benefits of waiting? Are they going to heal themselves? But that doesn't mean that, when you have bleeding pockets, you need to jump in and do scaling and root planing right away. We have to find the balance between healthy prophies and supervised neglect with perio.

# Perio Alert Status

"Perio alert" status is a great strategy for a patient of record who needs to improve their periodontal condition but isn't at the level where they need full-blown scaling and root planing: It helps to serve as a warning that the patient who has been coming regularly needs more than "regular cleaning." The perio alert status helps educate the patient and highlights that there could be a bigger problem in future if we don't turn it around at this point.

We are no longer doing a preventive oral prophylaxis at this point, we have begun to transition into therapeutic scaling and root planing: On this patient, we would do a full mouth debridement to enable comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.

# Definition of a Full Mouth Debridement

"The removal of sub-gingival and/or supra-gingival plaque and calculus: This procedure does not preclude the need for additional procedures."

Some think you cannot bill for scaling and root planing or a prophy if you do a debridement but this is not true.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

So for someone who is more than a regular prophy, we will do a debridement and then do a four-week follow-up to determine what next. If things are healing well and they are using the products we have given them, they may go back to a maintenance phase or a preventive phase. But if we feel they have gone beyond that stage, we can then do scaling and root planing:

The code for a debridement is 4355. The following is the ADHA position on 4355 procedure:

"In the presence of periodontal disease, periodontal debridement is indicated. These procedures can be the definitive treatment for gingivitis or early periodontal disease, or can be a pre-surgical treatment when the disease is more advanced."

With perio alert status, we are using this code as definitive treatment for gingivitis or early periodontal disease. 9 times out of 10 a more aggressive debridement will turn things around to the extent that we can go back to a preventive schedule of treatment without going into scaling and root planing:

# Supportive Periodontal Maintenance

The University of Adelaide defined the objectives of maintenance therapy as follows:

"The goal of maintenance therapy is to preserve the dentition for life, following periodontal treatment."

When do we bill 4910? Obviously, we bill 4910 right after active therapy, but what about after the condition has stabilized? Many of us are unsure.

02014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Periodontal Productivity Audit

It's useful to conduct an audit to see exactly what's happening in your practice: Often the perception of what is going on is different from what the reality of the numbers shows. So it's important to look at the numbers.

# PBOCEDURES EX PROVIDER

You should carry out an audit for each hygiene provider in your practice because sometimes it can very greatly between individual providers.

| |Dx Rutens| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M?|80|825Vm|3750|00220|0,13m|~z|
|81274|8|{m}|8XM|857.m|01110|M840560|
|31120|S7s0|3|013ca|33.30|0434Z|888|
|0*3|*42|D8o|Mtosx Oxke|Pase|Soc}| |
|RFwSD|Sm|Sc|38X0|4ic|90-day|Scnc|
|M8|TONc|80|7|4| | |

Pull your provider production summary report either for the whole year or for a cycle and then look at how many:

- Prophies were done (194 in example)
- Perio maintenance procedures were done (1 in example)

One perio out of 194 prophies tells us we’re not using the codes effectively. If your perio maintenance is less than 1%, you’re not billing correctly. No wonder we can’t stay on time! If we’re performing perio maintenance and calling it a prophy, we’ll have a challenge staying on time. We have to make sure we are billing appropriately with our codes.

02014 The Team Training Institute

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Insurance companies might suggest you alternate these codes to get higher reimbursement or they might suggest that, after the first year, you should no longer bill perio maintenance.

There has been a lot of misinformation about this so it's important to look at the facts.

# The definition of D4910 Periodontal Maintenance is as follows:

"For patients who have previously been treated for periodontal disease, typically maintenance starts after completion of active therapy and continues for the life of the dentition."

Therefore alternating codes between prophies and perio maintenance is not appropriate. Calling someone a prophy even when there is bone loss and bleeding is not acceptable either.

It's important we look at what the ADA has to say about this:

"D1110 and D4910 are not interchangeable and should not be alternated."

ADA Benefits Office January 2006

"It would never be appropriate to alternate them."

ADA Benefits Office January 2006

The final say comes from Mark Rubin who is legal counsel to the ADA:

"Knowingly alternating Prophylaxis and Maintenance to maximize insurance benefits would constitute fraud. We must code for the procedure being performed: Otherwise the Attorney General could make a convincing case for prosecution."

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It's important to pay attention to that advice but sometimes the challenge is not with the patient, it's often going to be helping the people in the insurance office understand that it's not acceptable behavior and may constitute fraud.

So if you have patients where you have been doing this for a long time, you need to explain to them that "insurance regulations have changed" and that doing anything otherwise would constitute fraud.

If you have a lot of challenges with this, keep that Mark Rubin quote and show it in your office.

Some insurers won't pay for perio maintenance four times a year but, if the patient has disease, we have to take the steps necessary even if sometimes the patient has to pay a bit more out of pocket.

We have to change the mindset of patients and team members and bill for the procedures that are being performed.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# When is Maintenance No Longer Enough?

Maintenance should keep tissues healthy and free from disease: If patients have bleeding pockets at maintenance visits, they need treatment, not maintenance. That doesn't mean jumping straight into quadrant scaling and root planing but we may need to take a closer look at what they are doing at home. Perhaps they need a stronger prescription mouth rinse or a better power brush: But we need to make sure that we are not 'maintaining' for years when we're seeing slow deterioration of the tissue and moving further into periodontal disease:

# Old Paradigm for Periodontal Disease

The old paradigm was:

- Hand scaling is the best way to eliminate calculus
- The infection is caused by calculus
- Bone that is lost will never regenerate
- Refer the "hopeless cases" to specialists

Now we know that periodontal disease represents a number of "wounds" that can be treated a number of ways. It's not necessarily the calculus that's causing the disease. It's not even the bacteria that are causing the disease. It's the body's inflammatory reaction to the presence of the bacteria that causes the disease.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# New Paradigm

The new paradigm is that early detection and treatment is ideal. We also now know that serious systemic risks exist with periodontal infection:

- Those with disease have higher C-Reactive protein levels. This translates into increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
- Pregnant women are seven times more likely to have premature, low birth weight babies.
- Diabetics or people with immuno-compromised diseases have increased risk for complications and disease.
- 80% transmission between cohabitants.

# Heart disease risks

The relative risk of cardiovascular disease is doubled in subjects with periodontal disease.

If you have periodontal disease, you have a higher risk for heart attack or stroke than having high cholesterol.

# Glasgow Scientific Study regarding Systemic Risks associated with periodontal disease, 2000

That's why it's so important that we transmit the risks associated with periodontal disease to our patients.

We now know that ultrasonic therapy is more effective. We also have laser therapy that helps to eradicate bacteria and can even, in some cases, help to regenerate bone.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# New Research Regarding Perio

Calculus is not the cause of the disease; it is caused by the body's response to the presence of bacteria.

Hand scaling not as effective as newer technology.

Antibiotic therapy aids healing.

Some lasers can re-generate bone.

Tissues respond better to full mouth disinfection.

# Goal of Full Mouth Disinfection

The goal of full mouth disinfection is to treat ALL sub-gingival areas of the mouth in one appointment:

Back in the old paradigm where we thought calculus caused the disease, we knew we needed to get the calculus out, but it didn't matter how quickly. So it made sense to treat the mouth one quadrant or half at a time.

"It makes sense to get all of the pathogens out as soon as we can."

If you went to the emergency room with a 20-inch long gash in your leg, you wouldn't be happy if they said they were only going to treat half of it today and the other half in a couple of weeks. It doesn't make sense, but that's what we've been doing with periodontal disease. This is because our treatment modalities were based on the old paradigm, when we thought calculus was the cause of the disease.

A university study in Belgium in 1995 found that with full mouth disinfection of all quadrants at once, there was, on average, 1.5mm greater pocket depth reduction than sites treated at two week intervals.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

That may not seem like a huge difference but, in the mouth, the difference between 3 and 4.5mm is significant:

More research studies have found that full mouth disinfection patients benefit from:

- Significant increase in clinical attachment levels
- Greater reduction of spirochetes and motile bacteria
- Reduction in oral malodor
- Eradication of P. Gingivalis

I'd encourage you to do your own research on this and look at the past Brilliance Circle newsletters covering this topic.

# Do Full Mouth Debridement Prior to Scaling and Root Planing

In order to do all four quadrants in one sitting, we do a full-mouth debridement first: We do this on the day of diagnosis and it removes the supra-gingival deposits and initiates healing:

When completed prior to scaling and root planing, local anesthetic is needed on only 5-10% of patients:

Full mouth debridement can be used as the definitive treatment for gingivitis or as the precursory step for periodontal therapy. It enables us to do all quadrants on the same day in the following appointment:

The debridement should take about 10-15 minutes with the ultrasonic instrument. We go very slightly below the tissue not too aggressive. You don't want to go so deep that the body can heal up over the calculus that might still be present:

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It should be comfortable for the patient so if the patient is in too much pain, don't go sub at all. Get as much of the supra deposits off as possible.

We pair that up with a prescription-strength mouth rinse. I use Tooth & Gums Tonic rather than Chlorhexidine.

The amount of time needed to do all four quadrants varies between providers. You need to allow enough time to get the job done properly while being comfortable for the patient:

You'll be surprised at how quickly the treatment can be done.

We typically schedule about 2 to 2½ hours for the appointment. You have to judge the amount of time needed but if you are following the rule of 80% power scaling, 20% by hand, you'll be surprised at how quickly the treatment can be done.

# Secrets to Periodontal Case Acceptance

You can be the best periodontal therapist in the world but if patients aren't accepting your treatment, it doesn't matter how good you are.

So, in this section, we cover four steps to improve case acceptance for periodontal services.

# Step One: Probe Correctly

Probe correctly and follow the steps of:

- Informing patients prior to starting what the numbers mean
- Verbally calling out findings

After you’ve explained what the numbers mean and patients hear you calling out a handful of fives and sixes, they already know there's a problem. So probing correctly goes a long way to increasing acceptance.

# Step Two: Have Patient Watch Caesy or another Educational Module

Caesy has done a very good job of creating a periodontal 101 in terms patients can understand in a few minutes. You can just say: "As you could tell from the numbers, we do have some infection in there: I am going to have you watch a 3 minute video that will help you know what we are talking about."

There are significant benefits to visual patient education:

- 87% of your patients are visual learners
- Provider can step away and enter treatment in computer or notes in chart
- Retention is much greater; they understand the urgency

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Step Three: Review Findings with the Patient

At this stage, we fill out the classification form. This form is very useful because it takes the judgment off your shoulders. It's not about what you think: The numbers don't lie. You can go through the worksheet with the patient and it helps them understand your recommendation:

You can ask: "Do you have any questions about the video? Let’s talk about where you are."

Then you explain that to clear up this infection, we need to do three things:

1. We need to do a deeper, more aggressive cleaning than you have had in the past: You have to stress there will be NO PAIN! Explain it's like having a splinter under your skin; we have to get it out so that the body can heal.
2. We need to change a few things that you are doing at home. This needs to be a guilt-free zone! A key reason patients stay away from the dentist is that they are embarrassed about the time since their last appointment and they don't want a lecture. They already know they are struggling so we need to change the focus from what they are not doing to what they can do:
- Introduce "prescription-strength" microbial mouth rinse
- Use a Powerbrush
3. We need to see you back more often: Make clear to them that saving their teeth is going to be a fight and that you will be working with them. But they need to come more often, most likely three to four times a year for the rest of their life. We have to build this value from the beginning.

# Step Four: Review Findings with Perio Brochure

We finalize the process and bring it all together using a periodontal brochure. This customizes your recommendations for them specifically. It helps them "get it" and it also gives them a copy they can take home.

The following example is one we created for our practice.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The brochure talks about why decay is not our only concern and about the risks of periodontal disease. Then it goes through the different levels of disease from 0 to 5. Then it covers our specific treatment recommendations for them. We check off where they are and what they need to have done.

This helps to personalize our recommendations for them. On the back of the brochure, we have details of the products we might recommend for them such as the mouth rinse and the powerbrush.

It includes explanations of the terms in language people can understand: We give this to every patient even if they are healthy. If they are healthy, we explain that’s why it’s important for them to come back regularly so that they don’t transition to the deeper levels of infection.

Giving every patient a copy of their report card helps build value for what we are doing: They understand why we recommended what we did, what the situation is and it gives them something visual they can take home: It helps to bring it all into focus.

For those who need further treatment; when you put the whole presentation package together including the Caesy and the brochure it helps them understand that there is more to do.

# Homework

Complete Periodontal Productivity Audit: Review all the procedures done this year or over last 90 days per provider and evaluate how many perio maintenance procedures you are doing: If it's less than 20-30%, you should make sure you are billing and coding appropriately.

Use Periodontal Classification Worksheet: That will help you evaluate classification among providers in your practice.

Evaluate your probing and see if you need to make a change.

Bill appropriate codes.

Make a determination to assess your periodontal paradigm.

# More resources

The entire course on perio profits is available on DVD. If you write a testimonial email sharing what you have gained from this course so far, we will give you access to the DVDs at 50% off.

# Questions & Answers from the Session

# 1. Do patients always come back for the scaling and root planing?

When you give them all the information about what needs to be done, they recognize why it's important: I use a picture of an iceberg to explain that what we do on the first day is just removing the tip of the iceberg and there is a lot more to do to remove the rest. Patients see the urgency of the situation and they make a commitment to the treatment.

# 2. If patients aren't complying, how long should we wait before doing scaling and root planing again?

If their CRP blood test numbers are not going down, you first have to establish whether it's true non-compliance or if there are other systemic issues that the patient is facing: It can be an indication of serious illness that may need to be referred to a physician. If it's a non-compliant patient, we've retreated as early as 24 months after the initial scaling and replaning.

# 3. Do you generally use Tooth & Gums Tonic over Chlorhexidine?

Yes. I have not used Chlorhexidine since I saw how well Tooth & Gums Tonic works. Why would you use a product that causes staining when that's what we are trying to remove? I've found that compliance is much greater with Tooth & Gums Tonic and the research shows it's much more effective. You need to warn the patients that it has a strong taste so that they know what to expect. It has all natural ingredients and I find that patients use it. With Peridex, patients didn't like the flavor so they didn't use it. The dentalherbcompany.com website has all the research.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# 4

What time interval do you recommend between full mouth debridement and scaling/root planing?

Sometimes I've done it the following day. Ideally you don't want to go much longer than 7 ~ 10 days. So we try to get them back in as soon as possible.

# 5

Do you recommend that we keep billing for full mouth debridement if they come regularly and each time we find bleeding on probing?

Once you've done a full mouth debridement; you can use a perio maintenance code. We don't use the debridement code every single appointment: We use it for the initial therapy visit: Then we determine whether they need more attention. The debridement should return us to health: If it doesn't solve the problem, we can't keep doing debridements: We need to look at root planing or other treatment.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Costly Case Acceptance Mistakes

The topic of this session is one that's an essential part of our role of being an exceptional hygienist: In previous sessions, we've talked about our roles as preventive therapist and periodontal therapist but one of our most vital roles and one that the doctor probably values most is that of treatment advocate for our patients. Yet many of us are uncomfortable in the role because we're not taught a great deal about it in school. We're not taught much about restorative opportunities. Our training is more focused on the other two roles so many of us don't have a great deal of confidence when it comes to the treatment advocate role.

Hygienists who develop a strong role as treatment advocates create great job security for themselves. We become invaluable in the role of helping the doctor do the dentistry they want to be doing and helping the patients choose better dentistry for themselves than perhaps they would have done without our help.

# The Team's Role in Case Acceptance

The team is incredibly powerful in increasing case acceptance. The fact is what others say about you and your service is a lot more convincing than what you say yourself: So when we talk about the doctor and the doctor's services and skills, it comes across to the patient as incredibly valuable.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

There are certain things the doctor can't say about themselves and the role they play in restorative dentistry: So some of that falls to us.

Even if the doctor is more eloquent; what we say is often more convincing to the patient because it is coming from someone else.

The fact is that; in our role as treatment advocate, the patients really value our opinions.

In this session, we look at how we can help get the best results possible in the case acceptance process and avoid the most common mistakes.

# Case Acceptance Mistakes

# Mistake #1: Not Enough Focus on the New Patient Experience

A big mistake many practices make with case acceptance is not having enough focus on the new patient experience. We need to make sure that the people who come to give us a "test drive" are served well: We need to take care of their needs in a way that we can be proud of.

Think about this:

When was the last time you personally referred a new patient to your practice? If you haven't done that in a while; you need to ask yourself why that is. Why have you been holding back? Is it because you're not proud of what you are doing?

We created a form that allows you to rate the new patient experience. If you've not yet had a chance to download that and review it, that's a challenge for this week. Download the form and use it to evaluate your new patient experience:

"We have 65 points of contact with every new patient. We have 65 ways to give them the WOW or 65 ways to earn a failing grade. The thing is that especially in this economy, we can't afford to compete on price. We have to compete on the quality of the experience."

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Improving the New Patient Experience

Let's look at some ways of improving the new patient experience and see how this plays in to case acceptance in a big way.

# Initial phone call

The initial phone call is really important: Many practices are now focusing on this and there are many opportunities for training in this area:

Previously no-one recorded these calls or monitored them so they had no way of tracking how they were doing:

Now many practices are paying attention to the initial call because it's our opportunity to create an appointment for that patient:

# Confirmation call

A lot of people struggle with new patient no-shows but the confirmation call can be key.

I recommend that we do a confirmation call but that we also have the doctor personally call every new patient the night before the appointment:

We let them know that we're looking forward to seeing them tomorrow at 10 AM and that we'll do everything we can to make them comfortable.

This is so impressive to patients. They are much less likely to cancel the visit last minute or just not show up. It makes a huge difference if the doctor personally makes a call.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Obviously it's not always possible for this to happen but those practices that have made this change have found great patient reaction to this call.

# Visual Impression of Office

If the office is not attractive then the patient's first impression is not good. Not all offices have the benefit of beautiful buildings with impressive signage but, whatever your situation is, you need to consider what you can do to improve the first visual impression.

You want to make sure that what the patient sees when they pull up to your office creates a positive feeling: All of these emotions add up to create their buying decisions. So we need to be aware of that.

You need to make sure that what the patient sees is congruent with the message that you are sending out. For example if you are positioning yourself as a high-end cosmetic practice and your decor has not been updated since the 1970s we have a problem. The first visual impression of the outside of the practice and the reception area are very important:

If the decor and furniture are outdated, the patient can't help but wonder if everything else is as outdated.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

How up-to-date are we with our dentistry if the office looks outdated? You may not have the cash flow for huge renovation but you'd be surprised at how affordable a facelift is to your reception area. One practice set a budget of $500 to do a quick facelift to the front of the office and you'd be amazed at how much change was made. The comments they got from patients were remarkable.

Patients are judging us on each of these steps:

- Ambiance of the practice: how does it feel?
- How does it smell?
- What music are we playing?
- What sounds are audible to the reception area?
- How are we doing with greeting the patient when they first walk in? Do we welcome them warmly?
- How timely is the gathering of the information? Many of our members are mailing or e-mailing a welcome package to new patients so that they can have the information filled out before they get there.

We need to be aware of all these little things along the way: the timeliness, the ease, the information we ask our patients for.

# How do we look?

If people are not in uniform, it's not that they look bad, but they are not impressive. Many practices no longer wear scrubs. I personally don't care for scrubs. They give us an excuse for laziness and sloppiness. But if you're going to wear scrubs, make sure everybody is well groomed, they are all matched, and the scrubs are not ripped or faded.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

It matters that we present ourselves as professionals. The same thing goes with the doctor. How does the doctor come across? Are they exuding trust and professionalism? Patients pick up on that: There is a way to present ourselves in such a way that we get instant trust and credibility. It makes a difference to patients and they comment on it.

As a team, how do our teeth look? One patient said to me: "I'll get my veneers done when the doctor gets his done." You don't realize how much patients notice. If we are promoting Whitening for Life, all of our staff should have the opportunity to have nice white teeth.

Personal grooming of the team is important too. Our patients come into contact with us for a limited time and, if we want to be perceived as professionals, we need to look the part. So our teeth and the way we present ourselves does matter to patients.

# Offering a tour of the office

It's not always possible to give new patients a tour of the office. For example, if renovation work is being done or we have a lot of clutter and boxes around, we don't want to be offering a tour. But the goal should be to help the patient feel comfortable and at home as soon as possible and the tour helps us accomplish that.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

But we need to create the right impression. We need to ask ourselves:

- What does the equipment look like?
- What do the operatories look like?
- How much clutter is there?
- Is there dust in the corners?

"There's always something you can improve upon with your whole new patient experience."

If the equipment seems outdated, can it be quickly updated or made to look better than it actually does?

Other things we need to look at are what the wall decor looks like. And what is the appearance of the patient restroom? We might not think this matters but it really does.

If the patient walks into the restroom and doesn't like what they see, they're going to be wondering what the rest of the practice is like behind the scenes.

We also need to look at what's on the walls. There's a way to make what's on the walls pleasing to the eye but also build value for the practice. That's really the smartest thing to have on the walls.

The patient's perception of us is the most important part of the case acceptance process:

It may not be fair or right but it's the reality of our situation: The way that we present ourselves to our patients is key.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The cars we drive or the clothes we wear may not be important to us. But we have to remember that:

In the first 7 seconds of contact, our patients have already formed 11 subliminal impressions about us.

So it's vital to recognize the importance of this and even go over the top in terms of being warm and welcoming: We should provide the kind of ambiance that suggests that we treasure and value that patient:

We want them to feel that this is a good place and they've made a good decision in coming here. The more often we can validate that, the better the relationship will be going forward.

Investing in marketing makes absolutely no sense if your new patients (or existing patients) don't move forward with treatment:

So my challenge to you is to view the form about the new patient experience and see what you can do. There's always something you can improve upon with your whole new patient experience:

This will have a very positive experience on case acceptance. One of the key mistakes is not paying enough attention.

# Secret Systems

Let me share with you some secret systems we've developed to help you create that WOW experience:

In our practice now, every new patient wears a white bib and all the other patients have purple.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

That way anyone who walks by the room, and sees that white bib on the patient; takes a step into the room and says: "Welcome to our practice; we're so glad you’re here." They take a quick minute to introduce themselves:

This makes a big difference to patients. They are impressed that we know it's their first time here. If that patient goes anywhere during their appointment; it's imperative that everyone who sees the white napkin stops and welcomes them:

The patient is completely blown away: They are wowed by this experience. They are very impressed and that's what we hope for with secret systems.

There are other things we have done which made a big difference with the patients. We've tried to create more of a personal relationship. We take notes and put them in the computer about anything they've shared with us during the visit so that next time they come in we can bring it up.

We also make note of any music requests they have. Then, next time they come, that music is already prepped and ready to go.

We take note of their fluoride flavor preference and we have that ready to go next time they come rather than have to stop and ask them.

We're trying to personalize the experience for them in every way possible.

It's made a big difference to our patients. They notice it, they appreciate it and the feedback we get is phenomenal:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Mistake #2: Not Asking Questions

A key mistake that is made with case acceptance is not asking questions. We’ve talked in an earlier session about streamlining systems and about the importance of conducting interviews with our patients. This is so vital to everything we do that it's important to reinforce it:

When we offer our patients elective services, they don't want to feel pushed. "If we don’t ask questions, we will come across as pushy. Questions enable us to move in the direction the patient is interested in. They don't feel overwhelmed and they don't feel pushed into anything that's not important to them."

We have to ask and then listen. We have to be looking all the time at everything we have on our service menu that might be a potential match with the patient's goal. Don't assume that we know what the patients need.

Asking questions respects the patient's and clinician's time. It doesn't take long to ask questions but you'll be amazed at what you can uncover and what patients are willing to share just by asking a couple of key questions in a few minutes.

Take the time to ask questions of returning patients and new patients alike in order to find solutions to their concerns.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Mistake #3: Too Much Detail

One of the key mistakes is giving patients too much detail. Let's review the old and new paradigms of case presentation and acceptance.

# Old Paradigm: Over-education

The old paradigm is to overeducate patients. These photos may look familiar. We used to have three-dimensional models and cross-sections because we were taught that; before patients could have a root canal, they had to know how it was done. They needed to know the anatomy of a tooth in order to accept it:

Ifound this was way too much information for our patients. It's confusing and some even said "That's disgusting; I don't want to know what my tooth looks like on the inside."

The old paradigm of over-education and teaching them how to do those procedures in order to accept them has not worked to our best advantage.

# New Paradigm: Build Value

The new paradigm is to build value and to simplify. Patients don't need to know how to do the procedure in order to accept it. They just need to know what's in it for them and how they stand to benefit long-term from saving this tooth.

We need to put it in common everyday terms so that they truly understand what we are talking about.

© 2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

We need to identify the specific benefits to the patient of that particular service. What's in it for them? Why should they do it? Why should they consider implants, for example, over a fixed bridge or the removable partial they've had for the last 10 years and not worn much?

The minute the patient is talking about? If they understand the benefits to them, they are more likely to accept treatment:

We need to keep it simple! The minute the patient is confused, they become overwhelmed and frustrated. We want to avoid confusion, overwhelm and frustration at all costs.

Those are negative emotions and we don't want any of them going through a patient's mind. It's vital to keep them focused on positive emotions. That's why we go over the top with welcoming new patients. It creates positive emotion: They feel recognized; they feel valued and they are more likely to move forward because of the positive emotions.

# How well can your patients understand what you are recommending?

Have you asked?

There are many videos on YouTube where patients have filmed their experiences in dental practices. They provide a lot of information about what we should not do.

We should not be using complicated terms. We should not say: "We really should have filled these cavities last time." You'd be surprised at what is actually being said in dental operatories. We have to talk in terms people can understand. Otherwise, they get confused, overwhelmed and frustrated.

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Mistake #4: Focusing Only On Urgent Needs

Another mistake we make is that we neglect to regularly discuss possibilities for elective services and cosmetics with every patient.

Some people think we can't bring up cosmetics with every patient because they would feel oversold. But it all comes back to the questions we are asking: If we're asking the right questions and we are moving the conversation in the direction patients are interested in going, they don't feel oversold. We need to discuss these possibilities with them.

Of course we don't want them overwhelmed and so we have to do this very carefully. We have to do it in a very comfortable way.

If we want to maximize the potential of new patients, we have to look at elective and cosmetic possibilities, not just urgent needs. Only looking at the urgent needs is a very costly mistake. If we're only looking at what has to be done and not thinking about possibilities we are losing out: We may think our patients don't want to know or we may have too many watches we aren't clear about.

We need to decide what we are watching; what we are waiting for. Is it going to magically heal itself? What are the benefits of waiting? Too often there aren't any benefits in waiting: So we have to be focused on looking for possibilities and presenting these.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

opportunities in such a way that patients will not become overwhelmed and confused:

These three terms both simplify and expand your vision:

- Mandatory/urgent
- Elective
- Cosmetic

Mandatory suggests it needs to be done and the time to do it is now. With urgent, some patients still ask "how soon?" By using mandatory, patients understand exactly what we mean and are not offended:

Mandatory, elective and cosmetic are valuable words to use when talking to patients about treatment.

When we summarize recommended treatment in these terms:

- Your patients understand these words
- They understand what you are recommending and are clear about what comes next
- We open the door for discussion about possibilities
- These words will help you do more dentistry!

# Mandatory

We classify as mandatory, anything that is:

- Broken
- Infected
- Decayed

65% of our patients don't understand what decay means. We have to make sure we're using terms that non-dental personnel understand. So instead of decayed, it's better to say "has a cavity."

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

With mandatory treatment; the urgency of the situation has to be expressed to the patient: This needs doctor-driven urgency. So the doctor needs to make clear that mandatory is what we are going to focus on first.

The hygienist or team member should always have discussed mandatory treatment with the patient.

This is the obvious stuff: It's when you look in the mouth or look on the X-ray and see that it's something you need to alert the doctor about:

Of course it's not our job as supportive team members to diagnose. However we can comfortably provide an initial clinical assessment to patients.

We can say: "Hey I'm not the doctor but my best guess is we're looking at a mandatory crown on this tooth."

The ADA definition of a crown being needed is where more than 51% of the tooth has been destroyed or damaged:

If you're looking in the patient's mouth and you see that more than 50% of a tooth has been damaged in some way, you can comfortably say that your best guess is you're looking at a mandatory crown.

Mandatory treatment is what will stand out when you look at the X-rays. Problems will stand out. You'll understand why they are hurting with it:

©2014 The Team Training Institute

17
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

Anything we can do to help prepare patients emotionally for the doctor's final diagnosis helps them be more open to accepting the recommendations the doctor makes.

Mandatory needs are usually what we're seeing looking at X-rays or what the patient is complaining about. It's very easy to have that discussion. For example, perio is considered mandatory because it's an infection. So we can talk with the patient about any perio services that are needed as part of the mandatory services that we're seeing:

# Elective

There are different definitions of elective services. For example, some people think missing teeth are elective whereas others say any missing teeth are mandatory.

There may be varying opinions on what is truly elective and what is mandatory. These variations are fine but, as providers, we need to know where our doctors sit. We need to know what they would consider elective treatment or mandatory treatment.

These are some of the things that we would normally consider elective:

- "Watches"
- Old amalgams that could be improved
- Looks concerning, but no visible problems today

©2014 The Team Training Institute
---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

- Missing teeth
- Sealants
- De-sensitizing
- Nightguards
- Large old fillings

In the example below; there are a couple of older amalgam fillings that you may classify as elective, depending on your doctors paradigm: It could possibly save the patient time and money down the road to get them taken care of now. It's good to have a discussion with your team and figure out exactly where your doctor stands on these issues.

# Cosmetic

I often hear of practices where patients have had cosmetic services done elsewhere because they didn't realize their own practice offered them. The practice was not talking with patients about them.

Do your patients know you provide cosmetic services? We need to have a low-key way of finding out if our patients have any cosmetic desires. It's challenging because sometimes it's intimidating to ask the patient if they are interested: Sometimes you'd like to say that they should think about it but you can't say that: So we need to find a way to introduce cosmetic dentistry without causing offense.

02014 The Team Training Institute

---
# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

This is a way that we can do that:

When you start talking about it, you might be surprised that some of your patients actually want cosmetics. You just weren't having a conversation with them to offer these services.

Maybe you've tried to raise the issue in the past but you came across as being too pushy in trying to make a sale. That's because you weren't asking the questions in an appropriate way and patients became offended.

This approach is a great way to introduce the option of cosmetic dentistry.

# Cosmetic includes:

- Anything to improve appearance of their smile
- Veneers
- Replacing discolored anterior fillings
- ZOOM!
- Whitening for Life
- Replace older-looking crowns

We need to be paying attention and looking for these opportunities and letting patients decide what they would like to have done.

Offering cosmetics as one of the categories on the estimate allows us to present the opportunities to our patients in a non-confrontational way.

So it's important to pay attention and realize that we can do some really beautiful work. A lot has changed with cosmetic dentistry.

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

The materials that we have to work with today are so much better than they were 10 years ago. Our patients deserve to know what the potential is. Introducing these terms before the doctor enters allows us to discover and discuss opportunities.

There is a video on the training website of me explaining to a patient before the doctor comes in that their treatment needs will be broken down into mandatory, elective and cosmetic categories. I go on to explain it in terms they can understand.

- Mandatory is anything which is broken, infected or has a cavity.
- Elective is anything that could possibly save you time and money down the road by taking care of it now.
- Cosmetic is anything that could enhance the appearance of your teeth: "Have we had a chance to talk about that recently? How do you rate your smile on a scale of 1 to 10? [Hand them a mirror:] We feel that every patient in our practice deserves to have a 10 if they choose."

Can you see how introducing mandatory, elective and cosmetic categories opens the door for the discussion of cosmetic opportunities? The transition into that is seamless. You'll find that when you start to have these conversations, you'll find opportunities that you weren't even aware of.

When I asked one patient to rate her smile on a scale of 1 to 10, I found out she was incredibly unhappy with one crown: I would never have thought to say anything about it but she hated the shape and color of it.

02014 The Team Training Institute 21

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

the door to having a discussion, we ended up replacing that crown with something she was happier with.

If the patient says they are quite happy with their smile and their teeth, we move on and they don't feel oversold:

Just by using these three words when presenting treatment; case acceptance has been shown to increase by 25%! The reason for that is that patients are aware of what comes next; they understand what was talked about and they understand what needs to be done. You might have a patient that has $12,000 of treatment that could be done but $3,000 is mandatory, $6,000 is elective and $3,000 is cosmetic.

It breaks down all of these opportunities into bite-size pieces that are more comfortable for the patient. Therefore they are not overwhelmed. They are not confused: They are not frustrated. So, by using these three words, we have seen incredible things happen:

As hygienists, we're the ones who introduce this initially. Then, when the doctor comes in, we should summarize the findings to the doctor in a transfer of information using the same terms:

In my practice we have been doing this for more than four years and, now, patients actually talk to us using the same terminology: When they start using these words, we know it's working:

My challenge to you this week is to start using the terms mandatory, elective and cosmetic with your patients as you go over potential treatment options with them:

# Hygiene Explosion 2.0

# Questions & Answers from the Session

# 1. Where should new patients go first to hygiene or to the doctor?

This is an age-old question and there is no definitive answer. It depends on your practice model and hygiene model. In my practice, I see most patients first in hygiene. That seems to work best in our current scenario. However, a lot of people are hesitant to do that because of the high number of patient no-shows or because they want the doctor to establish the relationship first: I prefer to see patients in hygiene first, although there are some exceptions to that; There is no 'one-size-fits-all' model.
