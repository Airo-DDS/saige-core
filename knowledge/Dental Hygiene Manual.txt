# How to Use this Manual

If you’ve purchased this, then you already believe that there are some things in your dental practice that you can improve. You might know that you should do something to systemize your business, but just don’t know how to do that. Good news- this book holds the keys and examples to everything you want to do in your practice!

Over the past few years, we’ve seen practices that are disorganized and chaotic. Instruments are not ever put on the tray the same way twice. Or some employees do things ‘this way’, and other employees do it ‘my way’. Good news- It doesn’t have to be this way! This book is a guide-post for what you should have in your office to help the team understand your expectations of them, as well as examples for what you should have to help run your dental practice with better systemization. If you can copy just half of these systems and replicate them to your own practice, then you will be way ahead of most other practices.

These documents and systems are not new ideas. They are ideas started by visionaries, shared, improved, and passed on. Our job is to continue the practice of passing them on so that they can continue to improve dentists’ practices and make your business less stressful and chaotic. It is with great thanks that we recognize dental rock-stars like Dr. Summer Kassmel, Dr. Jason Tanoory, and many other ‘Black-Belt’ coaches we work with. This manual also would not be possible without our assistant Nicole- an amazing assistant who is the real all-star of the project.

If this example manual speaks to you and this is the sort of thing that gets you excited, then you might really enjoy the private dentist-only community that we’ve created at the Dental Success Network. As part of membership, we have many other documents and spreadsheets shared inside DSN that come with membership.

If you ever have questions about this manual or want to see something in future versions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Addison via www.AddisonKilleen.com or Chris at www.DynamicDentalAscension.com. We would love to hear your thoughts and help you implement any way we can.

Our driving force is to help dentists improve their situations, so if you have enjoyed this manual, it would be amazing if you shared it with a friend.

To your Success,

# Hygiene Systemization Scorecard

When we work with dentists, we always start with a self-evaluation. As we start this journey of systemization with you, we would like you to complete it as well. Below is a complete checklist to help you see where you might need to improve. In each section, there are also sub-set checklists to focus on the strategies in that section. Go through this checklist to see how you measure up. Watch introduction video →

# Foundation

- We have defined the Mission Statement for our practice.
- We have defined the Vision Statement for our practice.
- We have defined our Core Values for our practice.
- We have posted these foundational principles in a prominent place as well as in the Operations Manual.
- We have made it an accountability for each team member to commit the foundational principles to memory.
- We ensure that each team member has committed to living and working by these principles while in the practice.
- We regularly review the foundational principles to keep them relevant and modify them when they cease to inspire and motivate the team.

# Operational Systemization

- We have created protocol sheets for everyday tasks performed by each team member (with the input of each team member).
- We have created Accountability Agreements for each position which includes: all tasks from each protocol sheet, all tasks that are shared among the team, the practice’s Core Values, and signatures of each team member, CEO and/or direct supervisor and office manager.
- We have taken photos of each of the following: Ideal tray setups, materials and equipment setups per procedure, common areas, supply, lab, sterilization, and business offices.
- We have an organizational chart including all team positions. (Note: team members may hold more than one position).
- We have team performance review forms that are completed and filed in employee personnel files after each review.
- We have agendas for the following meetings: Morning Huddle, Weekly Growth Meetings, Weekly Departmental Lead Meetings, & Quarterly Calibration Meetings.
- We have a complete Operations Manual with the following contents: Foundational Principles, Accountability Agreements, Organizational Chart, Agendas and Scripts for the Patient Experience.

# Hiring, Firing and OnBoarding

We have a systemized process for recruiting and vetting potential new team members.

We have a systemized process for training and on-boarding all new team members.

We have clearly defined the benchmarks and expectations for all new team members set for 30, 60, and 90 days of hire date.

We have bi-monthly performance reviews and self-assessments during the 90 day “Get Acquainted” period.

We are clear with our new team member of expectations and consequences for underperformance.

We have a systematic process for firing any team member.

After completing the entire checklist, add up all the completed checks and then calculate a percentage score. Put that score below:

Total Items Completed: ____ / 45

Percentage Score: ______

Belt Status: ______________________

# Use the chart below to grade yourself:

| |Assessment Score|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|Phase 0 (White Belt)|Less than 40%|Above 60%|
|Phase 1 (Blue Belt)|40% - 60%|56% - 60%|
|Phase 2 (Brown Belt)|61% - 79%|51% - 55%|
|Phase 3 (Black Belt)|80% - 100%|Below 50%|
---
Typically we see most dental practice owners start below 40% systemization. If you have taken this test and have a score close to zero, do not sweat it! Many people start there. The good news is that using the resources in this book will get you up to the ‘Black-Belt’ phase quickly as long as you develop the habits to form these systems everyday.

You might be wondering, “What does Black-Belt mean?” In the Dental Success Institute’s Elite Practice Mastermind, we use the ‘Black Belt’ moniker as the gold standard for what we all hope to achieve. This means that a dentist’s practice has an over 80% systemization score and a below 50% overhead number. In essence, a doctor is taking home half of all their revenues if they are the only doctor in the practice. We also have many doctors who do not do much clinical, and in these cases the dentists are still making 20-30% profit on the practice without even seeing patients.

As you progress through this book, use it as a resource to help you attack each section and get a better systemization score over time. Nothing happens overnight, but we are excited to help you get all the value out of this book and become more systemized!

A fulfilling team culture that is engaged with our community through acts of service and provides a welcoming/empathetic patient experience through genuine patient and team relationships.

A team culture that is safe and relaxed allows for connectedness and fulfillment. We have each other’s back, communicate clearly, and ALWAYS assume the best.

Our patients feel seen, valued, and heard because we lead with empathy and seek to understand. Rich relationships are foundational. Patients say their experience at our office is refreshingly different.

We are a dynamic business always on the forefront, paving our own way as we embrace new ideas and work through complex problems. We are a financially healthy organization that strives for efficiency and leads with integrity.

# Skills Acquisition Onboarding Checklist

The Following is an example for a dental assistant, but we recommend making a chart like this for every position in the dental office.

For every type of procedure or skill that an assistant might need to become proficient with we created a spreadsheet for “check-offs”. In the past I would ask an assistant “Hey how many times have you made a temporary crown?” and they would respond “Oh yeah I’ve made a few”. Then I would say “a few like 2 or a few like 15?”. They never quite seemed to know, and this was across the board for a variety of procedures. So we leveled up and decided we wanted them to check off a certain number of times performing, or assisting on each procedure before moving on to the next. So for example, we want them to check off a certain number of times performing, or assisting on each procedure before moving on to the next.

to view over the shoulder assisting on 3 crowns, then assist on 3 crowns themself with a senior assistant helping them, then make 5 temps on typodonts before making temps on a patient and so on and so forth. The following is a small sample size, for the purposes of this book we have not printed the whole list.

# Video Onboarding Checklist

Sometimes there is a higher level of detail that is needed to pass along information about your office. In that case, maybe it is easier to make videos and host those videos for your office and on-boarding. Below is an example chart that Dr. Owner had made for his office. After each employee watched each video, they would initial the chart. After showing the Doctor or lead assistant they were proficient, then their leader would also initial that box. This is not a comprehensive list, it is just a sample size to give you an idea of how to build your own video vault for team training (we have a more comprehensive list in The Complete Dental Assistant Manual). We recommend using the youtube page linked to your practice gmail account to upload videos as “Not Public” and hyperlink the links to those videos inside various written systems that they apply to as well as creating a complete video vault checklist like below. In the past we would say to new hires “go ahead and watch the training videos on youtube.” What we found was they would watch a couple, but because the searchability is a bit difficult and because we were not crystal clear on the expectations they ended up missing a ton of videos. By having a checklist that gets signed off on, we now know they are getting the education that we expect.

# Route Slip Protocol

APPOINTMENTS TO BE SET COMPLETE BY THE PROVIDERS ONLY. DAs and FO do not set appt. complete.

# Front Office:

- At the end of day, make sure all appointments are set complete
- Confirm the provider before sending the claim (The provider will set the appointments complete)

# Hygiene:

- Set appointments complete when the patient leaves.
- Make sure the correct codes are attached to the appointment before setting complete to ensure claim is ready to be sent
- If Whitening or Fluoride is added to the current day appointment, add the codes before setting complete and collect the appropriate amount - if unsure of the correct patient portion, ask FO.

# Restorative:

- Collection is okay to be taken at the beginning of the appointment, this amount is noted on the appointment.
- If treatment changes mid appointment:
---
At the end of the appointment, bring the route slip up with the new treatment written at the top and ask a treatment coordinator if the new procedure code is correct and what the new patient portion is. (Treatment coordinator should write the new patient portion on the top of the route slip for the assistant to relay back to the patient in the op.)

Walk the patient out and confirm again that the codes on the appointment are correct and get approval from the Doctor to set the appointment complete. (If a treatment coordinator is not available to confirm, mark the appointment as dismissed and leave the appointment as scheduled).

If nothing changed, set the appointment complete as it was.

FOR NOTES: Doctors will set appointments complete once procedures are correct. If you need to make a note in the chart, ask Dr. to set it complete to do so.

# ABC Dental Hygiene CE

Purpose: In order to stay up to date on the best practices in dentistry, we encourage our hygiene team members to participate in continuing education. Some reasons for continuing education are to touch up or refresh on topics that we are already familiar with or learn and potentially add new treatment modalities to best care for our patients. When deciding what CE to take it is best if the course will benefit the hygienist, the patient and the practice.

# ABC Dental participation in paying for CE:

Assuming the CE is to benefit the clinician, practice and patients, the practice is willing to financially support our hygienists with CE.

# The process is as follows:

1. Propose desired CE to Hygiene Captain and Office Manager
2. Depending on the cost of the CE, the practice can determine how much it can financially participate
3. The practice will pay directly not via reimbursement.

If the above process is not followed, it should not be assumed that the practice will reimburse for such CE.

# Implementation:

1. Present an abbreviated version of what they learned at the next department meeting or whole office meeting if applicable to the greater team.
2. Implement 1-2 things from the course

# Access to CE:

In today’s digital world there are countless high quality & convenient CE opportunities for free online. It is nice to be able to learn online when you want & at your own pace. Please remember we have access to many CE through our DSN and DSI memberships as well as via our other partnerships.

I certify that I have received & understand the above explanation regarding the continuing education process at ABC Dental Care….

# Handoffs

These are the components and examples of a smooth handoff from doctor to team member. Typically at the end of any exam or appointment. We know that when the urgency of the next visit comes from the doctor first, the patient is more likely to adhere to that. This is also written on our route slips or communication sheets. (In Open Dental you can customize the route slips, a great tool for making sure we don’t drop the ball as patients move throughout our practice.)

As a general rule, there are a few key points to a handoff. In order they are:

- 1. Introduce patient to next team member.
- - a. “Hey Susie, this is Rebecca, she will help you check out this morning.”

2. Give compliment about team member to the patient.
- - a. “She has the best smile and will help you check out quickly and get you on your way!”

3. Pass Information along to Team Member.
---
a. “Rebecca, today we completed XXX treatment and it’s all attached to the appointment.”

b. Pass along any other information according to the NDTR protocol

# 4. Say thank you to the patient and team member.

Should be very short, simple, and always include the needed information. This acronym of NDTR came from Dental Consultant Keira Dent (TheDentalATeam.com) and stands for the following:

- N: Next Visit will include the following treatment
- D: Date Range for the next appointment
- T: Time Needed for the next appointment
- R: Is their next hygiene visit re-appointed?

Usually the doctor can mix this into the conversation between the patient, themselves, and their assistant or hygienist. One example is to discuss a crown needed by saying, “So the next thing on your plan is to put a crown on this upper left tooth due to a large cavity. We should really get to this in the next two to three weeks to avoid it getting worse and needing a root canal, and the entire appointment should take about an hour. I’ll let (Hygienist Name) schedule that appointment for you, as well as the next hygiene visit to get the best time that works in your schedule. Any other questions I can answer for you?” The exact NDTR protocol was followed in this interaction, and it not only gives the treatment planner the idea of exactly what is needed, but also gives the patient a clear idea of the next steps in their dental care.

In the handoff, this will get repeated and so the patient has no ambiguity around what is needed, how important it is, and how long the appointment will be.

# Hygiene Explanations

# Hygiene

- The gum therapy can remove the plaque clinging to your teeth like barnacles on a ship, but that plaque was also touching your gums. Instead of cutting away your gums with a sharp surgical blade, we use a laser light to zap just those diseased areas to increase healthy gum formation and decrease sensitivity. -- It's like using a knife to get the peanut butter out of a jar, you can really get a lot, but we all know there's some sticking to the sides that will never come out. That's what the laser does for us.
- I like that I use a similar saying for cleanings. I let them know your cleaning is like your oil change. I can give you a Bentley but it’s not going to last 200k miles if you beat it up and don’t get your scheduled maintenance.
- I also use “barnacles on a boat” to describe calculus. You can’t just pull a barnacle off a boat, you have to use an instrument to physically scrape it off. It’s the same for the hardened bacteria under your gums... a regular cleaning won’t take it off but the hygienists can remove it with special instruments.
- I always relate periodontal health to the foundation of a house. “We need to make sure the ‘foundation’ is healthy and strong before concentrating on the teeth that use the bone for support.”

# Night Guards: Bruxism / Recession / Abfractions / Sensitivity

- “Many people grind their teeth, in fact a lot of us here at the office wear night guards for that reason. In your case you are showing signs of clenching and grinding, a night guard will act like a shock absorber so you aren’t putting so much force on your teeth and jaw joints. Clenching and grinding leads to recession and sensitivity and even chipping of your teeth at the gumline. Some people grind during the day while driving, working out or working on the computer, but most people also clench and grind in their sleep and aren’t even aware of it.”

# Gingivitis

- Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. I am getting some measurements that are reading 4mm. This means the tissue is red, inflamed and swollen. Bleeding is also a sign of bacteria under the gum line that we need to clean out. There could be certain points in your cleaning that it is a little bit uncomfortable, but we would like to get the inflammation down and the bleeding to lessen. If we don’t then we might need to do a deep cleaning.

# Periodontal Disease

- Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. 4mm pockets are considered gingivitis and 5mm and above are considered periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is bacteria underneath the gum line that causes bleeding and bone loss.
---
We can try to prevent the pockets and bone loss from getting worse. The bone unfortunately will not grow back, but the pockets and tissue health can improve.

Periodontal disease is sort of like having a bleeding-infection the size of your fist, but in your mouth around all your teeth. If you had that on your arm, you’d run to the doctors office right away, but since you can’t see it in one spot, sometimes it’s easy to say, “Out of sight, out of mind.”

# SRP:

A deep cleaning consists of getting numb to perform a thorough cleaning. We go under the gum line to the bottom of the pocket and clean out the bacteria and build up. We are hoping for less inflammation, bleeding and reattachment of the pockets.

Once we are finished with the deep cleaning we like to have you come back for maintenance cleanings more regularly to see how the pockets are healing and monitor the bone loss.

# Arestin:

Arestin is a localized antibiotic that is placed into a deeper pocket to help get rid of the bacteria and help heal the pocket back to a healthy measurement. It is a powder that adheres to the tissue and it stays down in the pocket for 28 days, you can floss and waterpik like normal but do not be too vigorous in that area.

# Cavitron:

This is a tool that looks like all of my other instruments but it uses vibration and water to help me clean your teeth. It is great because it flushes out some of the bacteria underneath the gum line and vibrates the build up off. It uses less pressure than traditional instruments so most patients like it better. If there is sensitivity please let me know.

# Whitening Trays:

We make whitening trays here in the office. We do impressions of your mouth and make trays that are custom to your teeth. Once we take the impressions you can come back and pick up your trays the following day if the office is open. For optimal whitening you can whiten everyday or every other day for a week or two until desired whiteness. Then you can keep the trays for touch ups down the road. You just need to put a dot of whitening gel in each tooth that you can see in your smile and leave the trays in for about an hour. It is normal to have some sensitivity after whitening.

# Recession/ Abfractions:

Areas of recession are located where the gum line and teeth meet. These areas are exposing the root surface of the tooth. The root surface is not as strong as the enamel which is the part of the tooth that we see and can be very sensitive. These areas are mainly caused by clenching and grinding. It is like a fence post, if the soil is here and you keep moving the board back and forth the soil around the bottom will start to move away and make the board loose and not stable in the ground. It is the same with our teeth. If we keep “knocking”, so clenching and grinding, our gums and bone will start to recede.
---
# Fluoride

- “We recommend fluoride to all of our patients because it has so many benefits for keeping your teeth strong and healthy. Fluoride helps prevent any new cavities and protect your current fillings and crowns, it also helps with any sensitivity especially in areas of recession. The areas of recession are also more prone to decay because it is not as strong as the enamel. It looks like it’s only 25 for today if you want to take advantage of the fluoride treatment.”

# Laser Bacterial Reduction (LBR)

LBR is when we use the laser underneath the gum line to reduce the amount of bacteria before we start cleaning. This can help the health of the gingiva long term.

# Laser Decontamination (LD)

Laser decontamination is when we use the laser after the deep cleaning to help get rid of bacteria that has worked itself into the tissues around the teeth and bone. It helps kill the bacteria and make the gums have a clean new layer of tissue to reattach to the teeth and help reduce the pockets faster.

# NIGHT GUARD INSTRUCTIONS (Take Home Instructions)

- Wear your new appliance every night.
- Do not be alarmed if you take your night guard out in your sleep.
- Please bring your night guard to all future dental appointments.
- Store dry in your new case.
- Clean with liquid soap and a toothbrush.
- Do not clean with toothpaste.
- Do not store it in mouthwash.
- Keep away from pets.
- If your jaw starts to hurt for any reason, stop wearing it and notify our office (by calling 555-555-555).

# Teeth Whitening

Follow instructions included in your kit. Total treatment time is usually 10-14 days. Some cases may take longer, especially if treatment is interrupted. Make sure you brush and floss thoroughly prior to each treatment. The bleaching gel can work better if it is in contact with the tooth rather than plaque buildup.
---
Mild sensitivity to cold liquids or air may occur. This usually passes a few days after treatment is completed. If the sensitivity is severe or persists, discontinue using the gel and contact our office.

If you experience any gum irritation, let us know. Your custom tray may need to be adjusted.

Whitening works best on yellow stained teeth. Gray teeth are more difficult to whiten, or may not respond to treatment. Such cases may require porcelain veneers to achieve the desired result.

Results can be quite dramatic. However upon completion of the whitening process, the color will “tone down” somewhat. This is normal and actually looks more natural.

Long term results vary from patient to patient. This can depend on many factors including habits such as smoking or coffee, tea, wine, or cola consumption.

“Touch-up” treatments may be needed every 3 – 6 months. This can usually be accomplished in 1 or 2 treatments of 1 – 2 hours each. A special touch-up kit is available at our office.

Existing fillings, crowns, bonding, etc. will not whiten. Therefore, these restorations may need to be changed in order to match your new smile.

It is important to keep your 2-week follow-up appointment so we can assess the results or make changes in treatment as needed.

If you have unsightly old silver fillings ask us about changing them to invisible white fillings. Old crowns with dark gum lines can be changed to more natural looking metal-free porcelain crowns.

If your friends wonder why you are smiling so much, tell them about us. It would be our pleasure to help them improve their smiles, too!

# PREVIDENT 5000 FLUORIDE GEL

If you are receiving these instructions that means you have been prescribed a topical fluoride toothpaste to aid in keeping your teeth healthy. In certain cases you may be receiving custom trays to aid in the application of the gel directly to the teeth.

Indications: Dry mouth, root surface caries, high caries risk children and adults.

Instructions: Before bed, following normal brushing, flossing and rinsing, apply a pea size amount of Prevident gel to toothbrush and brush onto all surfaces of all teeth, then spit out, do not rinse!

# PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS AFTER SCALING AND ROOT PLANING

These are some helpful suggestions that will increase your comfort and help you to receive the maximum benefit from periodontal treatment.

1. Tenderness is normal. To reduce tenderness and promote healing, every two to three hours, rinse with warm salt water: ½ teaspoon salt in a 4 ounce glass of water.
2. Avoid brushing or flossing the treated area for 12 hours. However, after 12 hours it is very important that you continue to brush well. Please be careful brushing and use a toothbrush with soft bristles. You may moisten the brush with warm water if tissues are tender.
3. Tylenol or Ibuprofen may be used as recommended for discomfort.
---
# 4.

Highly nutritious food is necessary for the healing process. Avoid foods that require excessive chewing, also, sticky, crunchy or coarse foods.

# 5.

Tooth sensitivity is normal and temporary. You may use a desensitizing toothpaste such as Sensodyne or any major brand for sensitivity relief.

# 6.

You may also gently massage the areas treated with your washed fingers. This will increase circulation and promote healing.

Lastly, please contact our office (555-555-5555) should you experience prolonged bleeding or any other problems during the healing process. These suggestions will help you receive the greatest benefit from today’s treatment.

# Post Operative Instructions Following Root Canal Therapy

Congratulations on surviving the dreaded root canal. You’ll be happy to know that, according to the current literature, the five year success rate for root canals is over 90%.

It’s not uncommon for there to be some minor to moderate discomfort in the area after the root canal. It is normal for the tooth to be uncomfortable for 10 days after today’s treatment. Sometimes, depending on the circumstances, the tooth and surrounding tissues may remain sore for a few weeks post treatment. This can be due to a number of factors which include soreness from the injection, soreness from placement of the rubber dam clip and from inflammation around the tip of the root.

Inflammation is a normal part of the healing process as your body rids the area around the tip of the tooth of the remains of the infected pulp tissue. Your tooth may be sensitive to biting pressure or the tooth may even feel loose. It’s all the result of the inflammation and sensitivity of the nerve ending in the tissue just outside the end of the root where we cleaned, irrigated and placed filler and sealer material.

DO NOT eat or drink anything for the next half hour. DO NOT “check out” the area with your tongue or finger. You have a temporary filling in the tooth and it takes about half an hour to harden. You are also numb and may damage your tissues.

DO NOT use the tooth to bite down on anything hard (peanuts, pretzels, ice, etc.) until the permanent crown has been placed on the tooth. The tooth is prone to fracture and if you bite down on anything too hard or crunchy you may crack and ultimately lose the tooth. You will need to have the permanent crown or filling placed as soon as possible.

# WHAT DO I DO IF THERE’S DISCOMFORT?

The primary line of defense against discomfort is over the counter medication. We recommend that you take 600 mg ibuprofen (three over the counter pills of Advil, Motrin or generic equivalent) every 6 hours for the next two days, OR if you are unable to take ibuprofen, 1000mg acetaminophen (two extra strength Tylenol or generic equivalent) every six to eight hours for the next two days. Most of the time this is enough to handle any discomfort.

You may also be given a prescription for an antibiotic and/or a prescription for a pain reliever. Fill the prescription for the antibiotic and begin taking the medication. Fill the prescription for the pain reliever only if you need it. It is our goal to ensure that you are comfortable.

If you have any questions or concerns I can be reached on my cell phone at 555.555.5555

Hygiene Post Op Call
---
# Hygiene Patients

All hygiene appointments deserve a post-op call the following day regarding their hygiene experience.

Example: “Hi John, this is Celi from ABC Dental Care! ☺ I am calling to make sure you had a pleasant experience yesterday with your cleaning and I hope you have a great rest of your day. Goodbye! ☺”

# Patient Instructions After Scaling and Root Planning and Laser Treatment

These are some helpful suggestions that will increase your comfort and help you to receive the maximum benefit from periodontal treatment.

1. Tenderness is normal. To reduce tenderness and promote healing, 1-3 times daily for 2-3 days after treatment, rinse with warm salt water: ½ teaspoon salt in a 4 ounce glass of water. Avoid mouth rinses with alcohol in them for the first 1-2 days after the procedure, it can cause gum irritation.
2. Be gentle when brushing and flossing. It is very important that you continue to brush well directly following procedure. Please use a toothbrush with soft bristles. Do NOT floss or waterpik for 24 hours to allow for proper healing. Continue optimal homecare with brushing, flossing and waterpiking after 24 hours.
3. Tylenol or Ibuprofen may be used as recommended for discomfort.
4. For 24 hours please avoid foods with small seeds, nuts or popcorn so nothing gets stuck in the pockets during healing. Spicy foods or very acidic juices would be best to avoid as well because they can cause irritation.
5. Tooth sensitivity is normal. You may use a desensitizing toothpaste. The recommended products are Periodontax or Senodyne Gum and Sensitivity. These toothpastes are most effective when you use them morning and night every day.

Lastly, please contact our office if you have any questions, should you experience extreme prolonged bleeding or any other problems during the healing process. 555-555-5555.

# Team Member Discussion Points

Here is a list of things around the practice that we should discuss with any new team member. This helps them understand a little more about the inner workings of the practice. Marketing efforts, specials and resources that your practice may have, really any of the little things that we may forget to mention.

FORM- stands for FAMILY, OCCUPATION, RECREATION, MOTIVATION. It is a little system that we use to record patient relationship building data that we can easily reference underneath the tooth chart in Open Dental. For motivation, we use it as a catch all, not only do we say is the patient Proactive or
---
Reactive towards dental treatment, we may also make notes such as: patient already has a Night Guard, patient is interested in invisalign, patient completed invisalign with us, patient is not interested in invisalign, patient has a sleep appliance, patient has a CPAP, patient is not interested in fluoride, patient is not interested in replacing tooth #3, patient does not want any implants- anything like this that we want to make sure the doctor is aware of so that every time the patient comes in we don’t say “hey we should really get you a night guard” and the patient responds “you made me one last time.” This is also a good chance to notify the new team member about dummy codes that we use for tracking and upgrade codes.

# How to Avoid Over-explaining

1. LESS IS MORE
1. When you over explain it’s because you have a fear that they won’t believe you, so you give more detail in hopes that they will believe you know what you’re talking about.
2. The more words you use to tell the truth, the less believable it sounds.
3. When you give more detail, you aren’t preventing misunderstanding, you’re ensuring it.
2. DON’T ASSUME THEIR QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT
1. If they want to know, they will ask. If they have a question, they will ask.
2. Instead of being a waterfall of information, be a well.
3. Next time you find yourself using the word “Because”, ask yourself: DID THEY ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION, OR DO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY NEED IT?
1. If it’s because you feel like it, you can probably do better without it.

# Verbiage

It’s about WHAT we say & HOW we say it

Don’t ask questions…

- NOT “would you like to get those fillings scheduled?” Instead “LET’S GO AHEAD and get you on Dr. Blue’s schedule, how does next Tuesday at 3pm look?”
- Not “Do you want to take care of that…” Instead “Let’s go ahead and take care of that now…”
- Avoid: Yes or No Questions - it is harder to come back and take control of the conversation when you do not get the answer you want or expect
- “Do you have any questions?” vs “What questions do you have for me?”

NEVER EVER EVER talk about PPO vs. Premier on a NP call - they have no clue what you’re talking about - if you find out they’re PPO only later - you call them back & have this convo

# Other Verbiage to Avoid

- CAN’T & UNFORTUNATELY instead say FORTUNATELY, I have great news
- Avoid talking about fee schedules - people don’t know what you’re talking about
- Avoid getting wrapped up in insurance conversations, let’s not forget the value we bring to the patient
---
Never say the schedule is wide open - specify a couple times (start by offering the same time and day the next week)

# Treatment Presentation Fundamentals

- Avoid Word Vomit - power in some silence
- Speak Confidently and Clearly
- Creating Urgency
- Goal is same day Tx (if time allows - they are already here, saves a trip, saves practice money, etc.)
- Avoid Overwhelming the patient (prioritizing - can present 1st priority only if they seem very overwhelmed)
- Whenever someone offers you $ take it
- Pre collect if we can - do not give option

# Collecting

“It will be nine-ninety-eight today…” (do not say dollars)

If we take care of a patient don’t be afraid to take credit for it

Ex: “As a courtesy to you Dr. Blue went ahead and took care of that 3D X-ray”

# Presenting Treatment

# Smaller Treatment Plan (which will be completed in 1 visit)

- Present all the treatment, MUST still re-iterate Urgency
- Goal: Same Day or Get patient scheduled within 1-2 weeks with Doctor

# Power in Silence

# Very Large Treatment Plan

- Once treatment has been prioritized…
- Avoid overwhelming the patient “Foot in the door”
- “Dr. Alex’s biggest concern is this first priority, we definitely want to get that taken care of right away, we find it best to focus on getting this done & then follow up with next steps…”
- Power in Silence
- Helping block things together - explaining you only have to get numb once if we get half SRP and fillings together
- Use oral sedation/ nitrous to help patients with dental anxiety - it is a great service
- If they do say no - ask pt if we can follow up with them in a few weeks (add to audit list)
- Getting over Fears of talking about $$$
- Remember - you did not create this problem - you are offering a solution
---
This problem will never get cheaper for the patient than it is today - you advocating for them to get it done now is your greatest ability to save them $.

The problem is not going away by you avoiding the $ convo.

Avoid making assumptions about the patient’s financial situation and their feelings about $, what they consider “expensive” etc.

Don’t offer/bring up payment plans unless the patient asks.

Don’t project your own personal view on $ & finances on the patient (It’s a free country and their choice how they want to spend their $).

# Breaking up Payments - Collecting

1. GOAL - Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan.
3. In office payment plan - 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments - need proper paperwork.
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing.
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford.

# Example verbiage when patient accepts treatment, declines NG

“Apparently these guys don’t believe in preventing future damage and costs so they’re not going to pay for your NG but FORTUNATELY you do get a discount and as Dr. X discussed this is really going to help protect your teeth long term.”

“So let’s go ahead and get you scanned for the NG ….”

Or

“Let’s go ahead & get you scheduled for X tx and that NG.”

# New Patient Scheduling Addendum

If a new patient calls to schedule a cleaning, we ask when their last cleaning was. If it has been more than 3 years, there is a higher chance that they will need an SRP rather than a prophy.

If that is the case, we can find a 60 minute slot on the restorative side and schedule them for an FMX and Comprehensive Exam 60 minutes before Clo or Michelle’s scheduled break of 30 minutes (or random 30 min empty slot on hygiene side).

If the patient does not end up needing an SRP, then Clo or Michelle will do a prophy during their 30 minute scheduled break (or any hygienist in a 30 min empty slot). This may require help from available assistants to possibly pull back the hygienist’s next patient (maybe do x rays or exam so we can all stay on schedule and make the most of our time.)

# 1 Week Hygiene Calls

Hygienists are responsible for 1 week hygiene confirmation calls for their column. If there are any off days make sure your columns for the following week are called. If you are on vacation talk to another hygienist to get them covered or do 2 week confirmation calls.

# Verbiage: If patient answers:

Hygienist: “Hi this is Carlie the hygienist over at Green Dental Care, is this Bob?”

Patient: “Oh hi yes it is.”

Hygienist: “I was just calling to confirm your cleaning appointment with me next Monday November 1st at 11am.”

Patient: “Yes that still works for me, I will be there.”

Hygienist: “Okay I will confirm now. If you have any changes you need to make we do require 48 business hours notice. Have a wonderful day!”

# Voicemail:

75
---
Hi Bob this is Carlie the hygienist over at Green Dental Care. I am calling to confirm your appointment with me next week on Monday November 1st at 11am. Please give us a call back to confirm. If you have any changes you need to make to this appointment we require at least 48 business hours notice. Look forward to talking to you soon!

Once you make the call:

1. Double click on the appointment and add notes in the appointment note section in the lower left hand corner. Add the date, 1 wk and if you left a message, confirmed or any notes from the call. At the end put your initials.
2. In the upper left hand corner go to the drop down menu next to the confirmed section. Select the correct option for confirmed, left message or texted.
3. When completed press OK in the lower right hand corner.
4. If the patient needs to reschedule try your very best to reschedule while on the phone with them for another day or time. Please make notes. ( THIS HELPS US SO WE DO NOT NEED TO AUDIT CALL IN THE FUTURE :))
5. If the patient does not want to reschedule while on the phone then make correct notes, move to the dummy column, un-select all the procedures and add the 48+ hour code. Break the appointment by right clicking on the appointment and selecting break appointment. A black X should show up through the appointment at this time.

# Filling Hygiene Schedule

While doing One Week Calls:

- When patients call and cancel, the dummy code is put in the appointment and the reason is put in the appointment notes. We are going to start putting more notes at the top of the appointment notes in capital letters with the following information:
- “PROVIDER AND SERVICES THAT WERE ATTACHED TO APPOINTMENT”
- When hygienists go do their one week calls they will look one week back and see if their name as the provider is in any of the appointment notes.
- If they see their name on the top of the appointment notes they will check that person's account to see if they have already rescheduled or not.
- If they have rescheduled no need to call.
- If they have NOT rescheduled they will make a call or text that patient to get them rescheduled.

# Weekly Hygienist Filing Schedule Protocol:

1. Each week the front office will print the Divergent Dental Recall List
---
1. The list will be located by the third computer in the front in the folder labeled ‘HYG AUDIT LIST’.
2. When hygienists have downtime they can start working through the list.
3. Audit! Please call or text the patient and then make appropriate commlog notes/documentation.
4. Please read the notes first!! Do NOT call if it is a contrast patient or notes about patient moving, etc.
5. IF that happens please inactivate and put the reason for inactivation in the chart. OR go to ‘Family’, double click in the recall section, double click on the cleaning and mark the box ‘Always Disabled’. This will take them off of the future lists if we do not want to call them but also do not want to inactivate the patient.
6. After reading the notes and making sure they are a good patient to audit, cross off the name on the list once you call or text them and put your initials next to the patient's name.
7. We will work fully through this list every week. A new one will be added weekly.
8. If this list is completed already please see below to look for more opportunities!

Goal: 5 per hygienist per day

---
# OPTION 2: Check Restorative Schedule

- See if any patients on the doctors schedule around your open appointment time also need a cleaning. If so, call the patient and let them know we can get them in at that time and knock out two birds with one stone.
- Also, if any family members are in need of cleanings then call to see if they can come at the same time as their family.

# OPTION 3: Check Recall List

- At the front desk in the silver file holder next to front desk phone there will be a 1-2 page weekly recall list.
- Google Docs has text verbiage already made or you can add your own and copy and paste into flex to text patients.

# OPTION 4: Look ahead 1-2 weeks

- If there is a gap in the schedule look ahead a week or two and see if patients at that time would like to move their appointment up a week but keep the same time. Check if pt is eligible to be seen early before calling. Let pt know that “we had availability to see them a week/two weeks early and wanted to offer that appointment to them.” Avoid using phrases as “cancellation” or “filling schedule.”

***FO will also help with the Hygienist’s Divergent List!

*** An automated text goes out daily to patients that are overdue for recalls if we have openings.

*** Hygienist will schedule PMV patients out for two 3MRC at a time to ensure time available.

***CONFIRMATION POLICY- WE WILL NEED A CONFIRMED APPOINTMENT WITHIN 48 HOURS OF APPOINTMENT OR APPOINTMENT IS AT RISK OF BEING REMOVED FROM SCHEDULE. WILL EXPLAIN THIS TO PATIENTS ON 1 WEEK REMINDER CALLS AND TEXTS. IF PATIENTS DO NOT CONFIRM MOVE TO DUMMY COLUMN AND OPEN UP APPOINTMENT.

***MUST MAKE COMLOG NOTES EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU AUDIT A PATIENT!!!

# Overdue Recall Protocol

1. Print List: Active Patients with no scheduled appointments
2. First check notes / popups to see why patient may have not returned
3. Call Patient:
---
# Hygiene Audit Voicemail

“Hi ______________. This is ____________ calling from ABC Dental. We noticed we haven’t seen you in a little bit & wanted to check in to see if we could get you back on track with your dental cleanings. Please call us back as soon as possible at 555-555-5555. Thanks so much! Have a wonderful day!”

# Hygiene Audit (Patient Answers)

“Hi this is _____________ from ABC Dental, can I speak with _____________.

Oh hey how are you?! We were just calling because you are overdue for your cleaning OR you had to reschedule your last cleaning and we just wanted to keep you on track with your regular preventative visits. I can get you in either x or y date (offer 2 appointment dates and times)?”

1. SCHEDULE.
2. If they say no: “When would be a good time to call you back to make sure we are able to get you scheduled with your preferred time?” add them to the AUDIT NOTE LIST the week they want follow up or say “you can also schedule online at your convenience on dentistparker.com”
3. If they say no, don’t call back- INACTIVATE patient and make notes

# Make Commlog

1. Voicemail: “Called overdue recall audit LVM”
2. Answered: make audit note

# If you do not schedule patient: Send Post Card & make Commlog

“sent overdue recall post card”

# If we have trouble finding them a hygiene visit when Patients Call back…

1. What day & time of the week work best for you?
2. Great let’s get you in on the doctor side next week
1. Make note in appointment (overdue recall patient needs cleaning if something opens up)
2. More than likely something will open up & we will be able to get you in sooner for a cleaning
3. Add to ASAP list - with appointment time preference notes

# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

New Patient without insurance

79
---
● Take FMX per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

# Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X Rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 8 Posterior PAs)
- A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional x-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional x-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment, etc.
- If we take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL
- If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X Rays

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim! (Here’s an EXAMPLE for why)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- - The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.

If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA x-rays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA x-rays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X RAYS

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 4 BW-X Rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)

Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 4 BW-X Rays D0272 & Pano D0330

Send of Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X Rays. (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance

Send on Claim: 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY

- If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.
---
- If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW & 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!
- If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #24).
- NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- Pay careful attention to any note from ins coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to the patient portion.
- This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but may waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
- If deductible applies to all x-rays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect the deductible amount from the patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW x-rays if they are not covered @ 100%.
- If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional x-rays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion.
- We take a new FMX every 3-5 years unless needed for a specific reason before then.

# Adult Recare - DUE FOR X-RAYS but NOT Eligible for BW (plan allows only 1x/24 months)

Send on Claim: 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), THREE Addt’l PAs as D0230 (+tooth #)

- In the instance that a plan only allows bitewings once in a 24 month period, some plans (such as Delta Dental) will allow you to take and bill out up to 4 PA x-rays in a visit.
- Hygienists may still choose to take bitewings and 2 PAs as usual, but on the claim, we will bill out 4 PAs
- REMEMBER THAT WITH PAs, The first PA you take will use the code D0220, and ALL ADDITIONAL PAs will use the code D0230.

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)

- If the patient is due for x-rays and is eligible for a FMX and we have not taken one in 3+ years, delete the BW & PA codes and change to a FMX (D0210).
- Can be due to patients changing insurance, not being eligible for FMX at their very first visit, etc.
- In the past, we used to bill out a FMX and just write it off if not covered by insurance. This may be the case for some patients (usually if their first visit was before the year 2022).
---
# PANORAMIC X-RAYS - no bill insurance most of the time

- Many times we take a Pano on patients for diagnostic/treatment related reasons (i.e. Wisdom teeth, implants or bridges, ortho, etc.)
- ONLY EVER BILL OUT A PANO TO INS IF IT IS PART OF A FMX COMBO (PANO + 4BW).
- Pano and FMX share a frequency on insurance plans, but the fee for a FMX is about $30 higher than that for a Pano, so when we only bill out a Pano, we are missing out on potential production. Also, if you add the Pano to a visit where we are taking other x-rays, keep in mind that this can prevent us from getting paid for any other x-rays if the patient is not eligible for a FMX.

# De-Escalating Patient Situations

I thought I’d share this because it came up in conversation with a doc that I know, and I think the best. Time to visit the things that bring us the most brain damage is when all is well that way if or when a situation does arise.
---
(luckily very rarely) we are more prepared and thus can approach the situation with hopefully less stress and more confidence.

Each situation is unique but this is a basic framework.

# Step 1

Mindset- think “Do I need to be right or do I want to be effective”

The need to be right so the patient is wrong will almost always escalate a situation faster, so come with the mindset I want to be effective. Being effective looks like the least amount of headache, and least amount of financial and time commitment and I would prioritize time over money here. If you’re focused on keeping money in your pocket here, that’s fine, but you will often pay a greater price if you stick your heals in on that mindset.

Sincere Second Degree Acknowledgement. To de-escalate the patient. This is sometimes all it takes. (refer to link above for training)

But let’s say we gave our best crack at second degree acknowledgement and that’s just not good enough for this person.

Carefully document the interaction. The goal is to de-escalate the situation here and find an amicable solution for all parties. Allow some time for patient to cool-off. Trying to solve a problem while tempers are flared is not the best option.

Now what…

# Step 2

If we are in person with patient, we want to avoid talking in circles, which is often what these patients will drag us in to.

Never get into a back and forth. “This hasn’t gone the way either of us expected or wanted, why don’t we curb the conversation and follow up on a call”

We can ask their permission that this call is recorded, usually not permissible as evidence but it will help us dictate clear notes of the situation.

We may get on 1 call with them, but this isn’t going to be a series of calls and emails, typically you want to say less than necessary.

Let them get into word vomit, not you.

Depending on the situation or “threat” this may be the time to contact Malpractice carrier for advice.

Contact Malpractice Carrier: you want to notify the malpractice carrier of a developing situation earlier rather than later. There is no cost to contact them, you simply tell them, “here is the situation that is developing, nothing has happened yet, do you have any advice at this time”

DO NOT allow for this to turn into an email thread if possible. If it turns this direction and the patient starts making demands via written email, this will automatically trigger malpractice requiring a lawyer to get involved and result in a case being open up on your record.

# Step 3

Depending on the situation, see what options you have to appease the patient to make the situation right in their mind to avoid a lawsuit:

83
---
# 1. Refund the patient?

# 2. Courtesy treatment/remake?

# 3. If you have a close relationship with a specialist see what they would be willing to do to help mitigate the situation

Note: Do not make any promises to pay for a patient’s specialty care or any other costs (i.e. time off work, pain, suffering etc). This can be considered a settlement and will need to be reported to the dental board.

# Step 4

Let’s say, a patient threatens that they’ve gotten or will be getting their lawyer involved. Don’t be cavalier about this, but you may calmly let them know…please go ahead and give us your attorney’s number and we’ll give him a call, we’re happy to talk to him. (The tone here is not cocky, but such that, no problem we aren’t scared, neutral demeanor)

# Remember

- Photography, good notes, proper documentation will save your butt
- I would hope there’s no negligence on our part and the consent they signed doesn’t guarantee a result, it just guarantees they were told everything to make an informed decision for themself. We have no idea how

# Team Responsibilities to Support a New Doc

# All of team

- Set them up for Success
- Remember new doctors will generally be SLOWER, MORE AWKWARD, it is our job to support them, have their back and help them get their speed and efficiency up - they may be the doctor but they have never worked in our office with our systems
- Edification- whenever possible
- Quickly make them feel welcome, part of the family, involved & a part of our office culture
- Sit down & get to know them
- Don’t forget they are working in a new environment- it’s like working in someone else’s kitchen - it’s up to you to help them get comfortable
- Load up with NP & existing patient exams for them early on - to help w/ RAMP UP
- Senior doctor send Fillings & smaller Tx plans their way
- Give them heads ups about patients in huddle

# Front Office / Treatment Coordinator

- Edification on the phones
- do more exams with a new doc to support them, help close cases and clarify what treatment needs to be done in what priority, also catch if Doctor is having trouble with treatment plans & give feedback
- Ask clarifying questions in front of patient during treatment planning
---
- Give feedback often - connect discuss how we can do things better
- Role play treatment planning
- Role play handoffs NDTR
- Review the Audit protocol with them
- Review their case presentations with them
- Review the CA/RS protocol
- QB office flow

# Hygienist

- Hygienists must at the beginning of the appointment mention the doctor the patient is seeing so it’s not a surprise at the end “I’m so excited you get to meet Dr. New Guy/Gal today, he/she is such a great person, really really good dentist we’re super lucky to have them”
- Role Play hygiene exam flow
- Prep them for opportunities for treatment on existing patients
- Calibration meetings
- Co-Diagnose (exam sheets fully filled out)
- Get patients numb for them

# Assistants

- Edify the doctor while you are doing a workup or getting the patient situated
- Have everything ready to go for them
- Take great photos & have good diagnostic X-rays
- Error on the side of more photos & X-rays (PAs Pano CBCT)
- Co-Diagnose - warm patients up for them - the more times the patients hear something the more likely they are to do treatment
- We won’t change systems for them but get familiar if they need certain instruments out or do things a certain way or get them familiar with our setups
- Put them with more experienced assistants
- Help them with the office flow
- Ask them for training on technical dental stuff (i.e. fillings, crowns, temps, dentures)
- They can Sit in on training w/ the assistants
- Give them assistant onboarding documents
- Teach them how to flip rooms / sterilization / lab work

# Hygiene and Doctor Co-Discovery/Edification Tips

Edification - The instruction or improvement of a person morally or intellectually. To uplift or speak highly of someone.

# Hygiene:

- Completely fill out laminated Exam sheet
---
# For existing patients look at previous exam sheets for watches or outstanding treatment

Take Intraoral photos on EVERYONE even if not due for X-Rays or teeth are “Perfect”

Educate, talk about some sort of treatment

What you can talk about… SRP, Laser, Fluoride, Fillings (Class 1 or Class 2), Failing Amalgams, Crowns, Night Guards, Missing teeth (Bridges or implants), Whitening, Invisalign and Cosmetic Dentistry

Edify the Doctors for success - CREATE URGENCY

Verbiage “I’m concerned about.. I want to have the Doctor take a look at this.. ETC”

# Doctors:

We are responsible for the results we create which means, we are responsible for the opportunities that we create for ourselves.

Be Prepared, Be Proactive and Be Consistent

# Before Huddle -

- Split up Doctor Exams
- Review patients previous X-Rays, Exam Sheets and outstanding treatment
- Bring an Impact Item on an existing patient to huddle

Take good IO’s - Seeing is Believing

Verbiage “Dr. G/I was previously watching or previously recommended” “I agree with the hygienist…” If you disagree with the hygienist still acknowledge what they recommended, say “I think it can wait”

# Flow of the Exam -

Ask the Hygienist questions in front of the patient, for example: “So Michelle how’s everything looking?.. Michelle, is there anything you want me to be aware of that caught your eye?” Hygienist speaks, then thank the hygienist for the nice summary. After this you can open up the conversation with the patient by asking “What kind of questions do you have for me?”

Do your EOD sheets and KPI’s (Set goals for yourself)

Strive for same day treatment but always make sure to check with the DA’s before promising anything to the patient (do this before you start your exam if you think it might be an opportunity for a same day start)

Edify your treatment coordinator, say things like “This is Megan, she’s going to help us make sense of everything we talk about today from a financial perspective.. ETC” This will build trust between your patient and TC which in return will build better trust with your patient and you

Capitalize on Recall patients too.. Patients with seemingly “perfect teeth” you can always recommend Night Guard, Invisalign, small Class 1 fillings and bring up watches if you see them
---
# Audits

Front office to do the audits for 3 and 9 weeks follow ups, regardless of this you will want to track and follow up with certain patients on your own like any big cases you have treatment planned. Doing this will allow you to own parts of your schedule and build further trust with your patients, making them more eager to get treatment done.

# Protocol for When Other Doctor’s Work Needs to be Redone / Is Failing

# Filling or Crown

- Before saying something needs to be redone check the notes, chart, prior x-rays and familiarize with the situation - there’s always a chance it met expectations / expected longevity
- Explain the clinical situation and the reason for needing to redo something.
- Support/back up the Dr that did the work
- Dentistry, like all of medicine, is an imperfect science; complications arise
- “I have seen countless examples of Dr. X’s work doing this very same procedure and I stand by his work 100% of the time, this is an exception and not the norm. He performs this procedure at an extremely high, elite level.”
- We work together as part of a group practice because we believe in each other’s abilities and skills and stand by each other’s treatment
- Come up with a possible reason for the failure/need for re-do without making the Dr look bad.
- Reassure the patient that we will take care of them and we warranty all of our work
- Encourage the patient to schedule with the Dr that did the original treatment
- “Dr. X really knows this clinical situation well, he is really the one that is best qualified to complete the care.”
- Schedule the patient with a corresponding “Renew” code in Open Dental and re-iterate that 100% of the original fee for the procedure will be covered by our office.
- If you are getting the patient to do other work on them, downplay the remake to the patient and make the other doctor aware and redo the treatment for the doctor while you’re doing the other new work on the patient.
- Make a clinical judgement as to the urgency and if it can wait consider waiting and if waiting have the recall with the doctor that did the original work.

# Failing Endo Protocol

- Mitigate patient expectations by saying, “It’s not real obvious what’s going on here- root canal-treated teeth can flare up from time to time. I want to check with Dr. X (whoever did the RCT) because they’re much more familiar with this particular tooth and in the meantime let’s adjust your bite and get you on antibiotics. Often a root canal-treated tooth needs the help of additional systemic antibiotics later on to completely knock down the infection.”
- Adjust bite and prescribe antibiotics
- Tell the Dr who performed the RCT and they will decide how to proceed
- Monitor, Retreat, extract, or refer to endodontist

# Needle Stick/Exposure Protocol

Any great assistant will hopefully not ever get stuck with a needle. However, sometimes random things happen and any number of employees in the office have had this occur. When it does, the question inevitably arises- What should I do if I get a needle stick or exposure at work?

# Protocol

- Wash needlesticks and cuts with soap and water right away, Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water for 5 mins. Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants for 5 mins.
- Report the incident to your supervisor as soon as possible.
- Call Company Care (or your local urgent care clinic) and notify that the staff member is coming for exposure.
- Document the incident at work with time of exposure and if possible leave for labs as soon as possible.
- Notify the source that they will be required to also go in for blood work with the following information for Company Care as well.
- If the source is under IV sedation or if the patient wanted to do PRD drawl we could take the source blood into company care with the exposed patient.
- Staff members should have the Source patients' information ready to go for the exposed patient to take into Company Care (or local Quick Care Clinic that might specialize in workplace injuries).

# MAINTENANCE GUIDE

# Air driven; Electric & slow speed Handpieces

# 1. PREPARATION

Remove the handpiece from the electric motor and detach the bur from the chuck.

Electric & slow speed Air driven: Remove the handpiece from the coupler and detach the bur from the chuck: Bring instruments to dedicated decontamination area. Remove organic contaminants with paper wipe.

# 2. CLEANING

Manual: Clean the external surface of handpiece with running water (&lt;38°C, demineralised water recommended):

Automated: NSK handpieces with this symbol are thermo-disinfector-ready and therefore may be washed and disinfected using a thermo-disinfector. When using a thermo-disinfector; be sure to follow its manufacturer's instructions.

# 3. CHUCK CLEANING

Complete this step wockly. Lubricate the chuck directly through the bur insertion hole. Remove dirt and cutting powder from the chuck.

Manual: Using NSK PANA SPRAY Plus, mount the arrow-head spray nozzle tip into the spray can port and spray for 2 seconds.

Automated: Using NSK Care, follow the system instructions.

# 4. LUBRICATION

Essential after thermo-disinfection. Essential prior to sterilization process.

Manual: Lubricate handpiece using NSK PANA SPRAY Plus. To prevent mist spray from escaping into the environment; use absorbent cloth. Purge excess lubricant from handpiece with air.

Automated: Clean and lubricate handpieces with NSK iCare. Be sure to use the right adaptor for each handpiece.

# 5. STERILIZATION

Place handpieces in a sterilization pouch and seal them. EN13060 4.6.3 recommends autoclaving for 20 minutes (minimum holding time) at 121°C or 15 minutes (minimum holding time) at 132°C. NSK recommends Class B or S sterilization: (All NSK handpieces are autoclavable up to 135°C).

# 6. STORAGE

After the sterilization cycle, immediately remove handpieces from the autoclave: Keep them in dust-free, sterilized storage. Bring them to a treatment room for use.

Of course it’s interesting to learn about communication and all the soft skills in the dental office, but generally we do dentistry because we love the clinical aspects as much as patient interaction. In order for

103
---
the clinical side of appointments to flow well, we need to be very prepared and ready for every way the appointment might go. In general, this includes making sure we are ready with:

- Systemized Tray Setups
- Similar Bur Blocks
- Sterilization clean and ready for flow
- Organized drawer setups
- Standardized restorative and surgical bins
- Standardized Implant setups

Standardized tray setups are essential to running an efficient dental practice. There are many ways to organize this and you will have your own preferences. When we add an associate or new doctor, we want to plug them into a system that works. It is in the associate’s best interest to follow the systems and setups that you and the team have in place. At our practice, we refer out very few procedures so we have one restorative setup that allows us to do anything from a filling to an endo and then we have carts that we roll in for the specialty equipment. We also have a basic setup for post op appointments, limited exams, crown deliveries etc and hygiene has 2 setups: Prophy and SRP. We have found if we have separate instrument setups for fillings, crowns, endo, etc it gets very cumbersome and makes it harder to onboard assistants or pivot when treatment pivots.

Bur block setups are also standardized for almost every procedure. Similar to the tray setup, it is key to have one bur setup that is the same for all procedures and all doctors. Keep it simple, not only does this help with efficiency, but it also helps with inventory and overhead control.

Proper sterilization flow is not only important for infection control purposes, but also for efficiency. There are sterilization standards that we must follow and have a system for. We assign one person to sterilization making sure we do spore tests (weekly), foil tests (monthly) etc. One thing that has helped us tremendously and has allowed for temps or front office team members to easily help is having laminated processes for each step in the sterilization sequence posted along the wall as you can see in the photo below.

# Cloud Dentistry:

Nitrous

Nitrous oxide is plumbed into every operatory. Each morning one nitrous tank (blue) and one oxygen tank (green) will need to be turned on. Open to the left - the dials on the top of the tanks will read how full each tank is. The tanks will need to be closed each night (turn to the right).

# How to turn on/administer nitrous:

(Doctors and Hygienist are able to start a patient on nitrous)

- Connect a nitrous hood to the exhalation valve hub and tubing
---
# Nitrous Oxide Administration

- Nitrous hoods located in baskets above the dirty side of sterilization
- Sizes small, medium, large

Use one of the two high vacuum suctions to attach to the vacuum source connected to the back counter.

# High Vacuum Hookup

|% OXYGEN|DISPLAY|DISPLAY|
|---|---|---|
|N2O|LPM FLOW|0, N2O|
|O2|Matrx|FLUSH|

Press the power button to turn on unit.

Use the up and down arrows on the unit to adjust how much oxygen and nitrous the patient will intake (usually start 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous and gauge how the patient is reacting).

Place the nitrous hood over the patient’s nose.

Instruct the patient to take deep breaths in and out through their nose.

Nitrous will take about 5 mins to take effect.

After the patient is feeling the effects of the nitrous you can turn up or down according to the patient’s preference.

Someone must be in the room at all times monitoring a patient on nitrous.

Once the procedure is complete, turn the oxygen up to 100% for 5 mins to flush the nitrous out of the patient’s system.

The patient can be dismissed after the pure oxygen is administered and they are feeling back to “normal.”

# Go Whitening Box Protocol

# What is Go Whitening?

Go whitening is prescription strength (15% hydrogen peroxide) whitening in pre-filled trays made by opalesense. One box comes with ten sets of trays.

# How much is Go Whitening?

We are selling go whitening for a flat rate of $149.

# How do you use it?

When you open the box there are ten sets of trays. You open one package and there is an upper tray and a lower tray. The strips come in a green applicator tray.

1. Brush your teeth
2. Put the upper tray in, close your mouth and swallow. Take out the green applicator tray and you will be left with the whitening strip on the upper teeth in your mouth.
3. Repeat step two for the lower tray.
4. Slightly bite down to stabilize once both trays are in.
5. Keep trays in for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
6. Remove trays, throw away and brush your teeth to remove residue.

Teeth might be slightly sensitive for a couple days. We would recommend using sensodyne when whitening.

Patients can use trays everyday for ten days, every other day or until reaching their desired shade. If they use five and get to desired whiteness then they can save the other trays. They do not go bad. After ten trays it is recommended waiting 3-4 months until restarting the process.

# Go Whitening in Open Dental:

There is a specific code in open dental for Go Whitening Box. When a patient requests to buy it then we add this code in their chart, take their payment and give them a box. WE ARE ONLY SELLING WHOLE BOXES! DO NOT TAKE TRAYS OUT OF BOX. Inventory will be taken each month.

CODE: GOWHITE / Go Whitening Box

# Hygiene Diagnosing & Perio Protocol:

1-3 mm pockets: Healthy (D1110)

- If there is localized bleeding and 4mm pockets then perform LBR or prepare patient and put it in the next cleaning as a service we will be doing
- (Code = LBR)
- On healthy patients we will record a new perio chart once per year. We will alternate x-rays and perio charting.

Generalized 4mm bleeding pockets w/ no bone loss: Gingivitis Cleaning with LBR and cetacaine if needed

D4346 charged out (Will auto populate in the treatment plan how much patient owes)

Patient pays out of pocket for LBR $39
---
# DSP Plan

If a patient signs up for the DSP plan we will give the patient 15% off the D4346 code and include LBR complimentary for the patient.

# 5mm+ bleeding pockets with bone loss = Periodontal (GUM) disease (D4341 or D4342)

- 4-5mm PD: Mild Periodontal Disease
- 5-6mm PD: Moderate Periodontal Disease
- 7+mm PD: Severe Periodontal Disease - Generalized 7-8mm pockets give option to refer
- LD 5+ mm pockets with bleeding pockets. Included in explosion code for all SRP treatment plans

# Periodontal Maint (D4910)

Following SRP every 3-4 months

- LBR best option
- We will record perio charting at every maintenance visit except the one time per year that we are doing x-rays on the patient.

# Potential Arestin 5+mm bleeding pockets (D4381)

- $60 per site - at periodontal maint visits

If the patient has only one limited SRP quad we can go back to doing a prophy cleaning. If there are 2 or more limited SRP quads we will do periodontal maintenance cleanings.

All new patients will get a perio chart documented in the chart.

# Fluoride (D1206)

- Every patient once every 6 months for cavity prevention and sensitivity relief

# 2+mm recession, abfractions, or attrition

- Nightguard (D9944) or invisalign

# The ‘Hygiene Consult’ code

Is for hygienists to use when a patient was seen as a new patient in restorative and a hygienist went in to see the patient and probe/ diagnose/ treatment plan the correct cleaning. It will be added so we know a hygienist saw the patient, recommended appropriate cleaning and so the hygienist can make notes.

# Generalized Severe periodontal disease

Refers to periodontists. Give patients the option of doing deep cleaning here and give them the option to see a periodontist for more intense, expensive treatment to save teeth. If a patient chooses to stay here for SRP, explain the prognosis of teeth that look like they will be lost in the future and make notes. Fill out a referral form and scan into the patient's chart, make documentation of offering this to the patient.

# We refer to:

When a patient gets SRP completed when sedated, schedule them a 4 week fine scale appointment for 30 minutes. At this visit the hygienist will touch up any areas and check for calculus left behind because it is harder to work on sedated patients. Patients will not be billed for this appointment. If they have a crown delivery please consolidate appointments.
---
# Code: HYG POST OP (4 week fine scale post op)

After a patient has gotten SRP and does periodontal maintenance cleanings for 2-3 years and there is still bleeding, the patient can repeat the SRP process at hygienist recommendations. We can offer other services such as LBR and arestin in areas too before doing another SRP.

If a patient refuses SRP treatment they must sign the refusal form stating they know what we recommended and they are choosing to do a regular cleaning. They are able to sign this form 2-3 times before the hygienist refuses to do a prophy cleaning. The hygienist must educate the patient on periodontal disease every time the patient comes into the office. After 2-3 prophy cleanings do not schedule the patient for recare and tell them to give us a call when they are ready for the deep cleaning.

New patients will get a COMP Exam, FMX and when needed a PANO. All x-rays will be billed under hygienist. The ONLY thing billed under the doctor is the exam. Once a patient is established, x-rays will be taken once a year, unless the patient is having pain or issues. We will take bitewings and PAs of any implants or endo teeth. (See x-ray protocol for more information)

When doing all periodontal charting probe depths we will document bleeding using the spacebar OR B on keyboard.

On the first new patient appointment with a patient when we do x-rays and perio charting, we will also document recession and abfraction areas. We will take three cosmetic photos (see cosmetic photos protocol). These photos will document the recession areas when the patient comes in for their first visit. At the first or second visit when perio charting we will document recession in the perio chart area in open dental.

If a patient has traumatic occlusion and has signs of wear/ recession. Educate pt using cosmetic pictures and discuss invisalign and night guard as options. Show the patient the night guard and invisalign trays so they are educated before the doctor comes in for an exam.

New patients will be shown the new patient slideshow to understand what we are looking for and how we diagnose.

When doing X-rays once a year, include PAs of any endo treated teeth and/or implants in addition to bitewing X-rays. If there are any areas with severe bone loss that are not able to be seen in horizontal bitewings then perform PA x-rays or a PANO.

Take additional IO’s necessary for insurance and pt education purposes. IO photos of severely bleeding gums can help with insurance coverage, especially with limited SRP or when bone loss is not as clearly shown on the X-rays.
---
Utilize laminated AAP classification chart to properly diagnose. On the computer under the “Explanations” folder there are also pictures to help explain SRP, laser, sealants, etc to the patient.

If there is a treatment that could possibly be higher priority than the cleaning, get the DR. to do the exam first prior to proceeding with SRP. Then able to present a full trx plan to pt upon completion of the exam.

Before doing SRP patients must sign treatment plan form, consent forms and have blood pressure taken and documented on route slip. The SRP treatment plan must have periodontal maint cleaning on it and be explained at time of SRP.

Before the doctor comes in for an exam please fill out the laminated exam form with everything that was discussed with the patient and give proper hand off to the doctor during the exam.

Appropriate services will auto populate under the hygiene quick buttons. These buttons will include SRP, LD, GING, LBR and periodontal maintenance.

# HYGIENE LASER PROTOCOL

Laser Decontamination: $50 per Quad with SRP /$200 Full Mouth (Debride setting)

Code: D4999

Laser Bacterial Reduction (LBR) FM- $39 Fee (Perio setting)

Code: LBR No bill ins

# When should I use the Laser?

- The Laser is a great tool for bacterial decontamination of the gingiva. When healing of the tissues cannot occur from scaling alone.
- Laser can be used in conjunction with SRP, Perio maint, gingival cleaning, or a prophy.
- ONLY use a laser when there is erythema and edematous bleeding tissue present!

# How can I explain to my pt why they need this?

- It is important to tell the pt that when we are cleaning we are able to scale the tooth and flush out the pocket, but over time bacteria can embed itself into the gum tissue on the inside of the pocket. We are not able to get to that with instruments alone. The laser is pain free (we use cetacaine gel in conjunction) and it takes off a microscopic layer of tissue that is infected and allows the fresh tissue to heal nicely back to the tooth.
- This allows for the gum, tooth and pocket to be bacteria free.
- The reason there is bleeding when we measure the pocket? If you were to fold the inside of the pocket back to look at it, there would be tiny ulcerations in it, which are causing the bleeding.
---
Bleeding. This is not normal. It would be like if you had tiny infected cuts on your arm that just won't heal. That's why we need the laser to remove the ulcerated tissue and allow the fresh layer to heal.

# Benefits:

- Allows for shorter healing time
- Minimally invasive (no cutting and no stitches)
- Helps reduce risk for needing more extensive tx such as osseous surgery
- Reduces expense

# Process:

- Take x-rays and gum measurements
- Use the above explanation to the pt to gain acceptance of procedure
- Print TX plan and go over cost with pt.
- Set up laser and complete cleaning prior to using laser
- Will not want to put anything in pocket after for 24 hours after use of laser to allow blood clots to stay in pockets

This code is to be used when pt’s periodontium is not healthy enough for a prophy, but does not have enough bone loss for SRP. Insurance companies have not been paying for the gingivitis cleaning D4346, Please use following protocol instead of using that code:

1. Explain to pt using probe depths and xrays the NEED for a gingivitis cleaning. “I’m seeing a lot of 4 and 5mm pockets with bleeding that is just too deep for you to clean at home. Even with the best homecare of brushing and flossing, that only reaches about 3mm into the pocket. The good thing is I'm not seeing any bone loss at this time so by doing the gingivitis cleaning we can reverse the inflammation and get you back on track with regular cleaning.”
2. Print out TX plan using prophy code D1110 along with the NON BILL INS CODE: GING. This code will charge the pt an additional $60 that pt will pay out of pocket. Explain to pt “With the gingivitis cleaning you will have a small out of pocket of $60 since it is a different type of cleaning where we will use a numbing gel and clean underneath your gums to stop the infection. As long as you maintain good homecare and come in regularly for cleanings we should be able to get you back on normal preventive cleaning that ins usually covered after this”.
- If pt gives push back on cost, explain: “The $60 for the gingivitis cleaning will actually be saving you money in the long run. If gingivitis is left untreated, the bacteria in those deep pockets is just going to keep causing trauma to the tissues and eventually start to cause bone loss around your teeth. When that happens that's when we need to do a deep cleaning with anesthetic and INS does not usually cover all of that.”
- If the patient states “I just want regular cleaning”. Respond: “By doing a regular cleaning today, that would be a disservice to you. A regular cleaning stays above the gums and is meant for healthy tissues. Therefore, all of those deposits and bacteria below the gums will stay there and continue to cause trauma to the tissues and may have you needing more extensive tx in the future which I definitely want to help you avoid!”
3. If pt has not been in for a cleaning in years and is giving push back about not being able to have a prophy: Explain: “I totally understand since you were probably on regular cleanings when you went to the dentist before. Since it has been X amount of years, you’ve missed out on X amount of cleanings. With the gingivitis cleaning you’ll be able to catch up after all those missed cleanings, there is build up and bleeding that just can’t be taken care of with a regular cleaning”.
- (if pt has not been to the dentist in 2 yrs, tell them how they have missed 4 cleanings).
- ***sidenote: If pt is a regular flosser and has noticed bleeding- let them know how the bleeding is not normal. Bleeding is a sign of active infection and that bacteria is down in the pocket.
- If pt is a reg flosser and has not noticed bleeding, pt could be a smoker making the tissue fibrotic, pt could be flossing incorrectly, or in some cases the pocket is so deep and we are getting bleeding in 4, 5, or 6mm and explain how floss naturally only gets 2-3mm below the gumline, so they are not able to get to where the damage is.
4. Once pt accepts, ALWAYS sign general consent and start cleaning using cetacaine gel.

Whitening - Code: WHITENING

(Lower %, Longer wear time). 10% Carbamide Peroxide

$325

Goodie bag containing: trays on models, Box containing 4 syringes and instructions.

Once impressions are taken, schedule pt for a 15 min delivery appt., 48 business hours after impressions are taken.

Cost for whitening refill tubes - Code: WHTSYRINGE (PROVIDER = GDC)

$40 a box (containing 4 syringes) or $10 a tube of the individual syringes.

(Initial Custom Whitening Trays w/4 whitening syringes/tubes = $325)

# Teeth Whitening Instructions

- Follow any instructions included in your kit.
- Make sure you brush and floss thoroughly prior to each treatment. The bleaching gel can work better if it is in contact with the tooth rather than plaque buildup.
- Place a small drop (the size of a grain of rice) of whitening gel on the inside of the tray where the tray will touch the front of the teeth you desire to whiten.
- Place tray on the teeth.
- Total treatment time is usually 10-14 days. 2-4 hrs per day. Some cases may take longer, especially if treatment is interrupted.
- Mild sensitivity to cold liquids or air may occur. This usually passes a few days after treatment is completed. If the sensitivity is severe or persists, discontinue using the gel and contact our office.
---
If you experience any gum irritation, let us know. Your custom tray may need to be adjusted.

Whitening works best on yellow stained teeth. Gray teeth are more difficult to whiten, or may not respond to treatment. Such cases may require porcelain veneers to achieve the desired result.

Results can be quite dramatic. However upon completion of the whitening process, the color will “tone down” somewhat. This is normal and actually looks more natural.

Long term results vary from patient to patient. This can depend on many factors including habits such as smoking or coffee, tea, wine, or cola consumption.

“Touch-up” treatments may be needed every 3 – 6 months. This can usually be accomplished in 1 or 2 treatments of 2-4 hours each. A special touch-up kit is available at our office.

Existing fillings, crowns, bonding, etc. will not whiten. Therefore, these restorations may need to be changed in order to match your new smile.

If you have unsightly old silver fillings ask us about changing them to invisible white fillings. Old crowns with dark gumlines can be changed to more natural looking metal-free porcelain crowns.

If your friends wonder why you are smiling so much, tell them about us. It would be our pleasure to help them improve their smiles, too! ☺

# Bleach Tray Process

# Impressions:

# Materials needed:

- Alginate
- Water
- Two bowls
- Two spatulas
- Upper/lower tray
---
1. Check Pts arch to see what size tray they need and try in tray
2. Two scoops powder to two scoops water for each tray. (always equal amounts).
3. Mix to a uniform consistency and quickly load tray.
4. Make sure to push on tray evenly in pt’s arch to get the best results.
5. Have Dr. or hygienist check impression before continuing to Models.

# Bleach Tray Models:

Materials needed:

- Stone
- Water
- Two bowls
- Spatula
- Vibrator
- Small hand instrument

1. NEVER DO BASE on bleach trays impressions
2. Have impression on vibrator as stone is poured into tray to avoid bubbles and voids.
3. Start at one side and hold impression at an angle on vibrator so stone runs down along teeth surfaces.
4. When set to the side let impressions set up for 40 minutes.
5. Once hard, remove stone model from tray and trim as needed.
6. Mix extra stone if needed to fill any voids and remove any bubbles with small hand instrument.

# Making Custom Trays:

Needed:

- Suck-down machine
- One square of bleaching tray material
- Upper and lower model
---
# 6

1. Place one of the bleach tray squares in suck down and tighten into position.
2. Place models back to back on bottom of suck-down machine.
3. Turn suck-down on, and let it heat up the material.
4. Material should melt into a nice half circle, turn off heat and drop the material onto model quickly and evenly.
5. Peel off whitening trays from models and trim with scissors.
6. Scallop along buccal of teeth so no part of the plastic is on the gingiva.
7. Leave a rim on lingual side of teeth to help retention.
8. Have Hygienist check trays before giving to pt to make sure they are cut properly and are presentable.

# Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) Criteria/Protocol

- X-RAYS
- Make sure we have quality x-rays to send along with SRP claims. Take BW and/or PAs as needed, even if the pt is not eligible (we can write it off)
- Bitewings need to show all the way to bone levels
- Sometimes we only have BWs on file from NP appt, and will need to take additional PAs of the anterior teeth for submission to insurance
- A Pano alone will NOT be accepted by ins - must take BWs and PAs for SRP, but can send in a pinch if the other x-rays are not of proper diagnostic quality
---
# Current Guidelines for SRP and Insurance Claims

- X-rays must show crestal bone loss
- Hygienists should assist front office with adjusting contrast of x-rays to show bone loss, spurs, calcium deposits, loss of attachment for claim submission
- GUARDIAN INSURANCE IS TOP OFFENDER FOR DENYING CLAIMS. THE ONLY THING THEY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS BONE LOSS ON XRAYS! If bone loss is not incredibly obvious on x-rays, the claim will be denied with no hope for appeal success.
- Good IOs can also be helpful. (i.e. If a patient has significant bleeding upon probing, etc.)

# Perio Charting

- Each insurance company has slightly different criteria, but typically patient should have at least 5mm+ pockets to qualify for SRP (Aetna now requires 6mm pockets)
- Be sure that perio charting has been completed, and within the last 6 months

# Comorbidities/Health Hx

- This can be useful as well to include in chart notes
- Smokers, diabetes, systemic/autoimmune disorders, over age 40, no dental care in a long time, family history, etc
- IF THE PATIENT IS UNDER THE AGE OF 40, SRP IS MORE LIKELY TO BE DENIED

# Scheduling SRP

- ALWAYS BEST TO ONLY DO 2 QUADS PER DAY
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER 4 quads same day if a patient has Delta Dental, Aetna, Guardian, or United Concordia insurance!!!!
- If pt does not have one of the aforementioned insurances, only schedule 4 quads same day if it is in conjunction with other treatment and sedation
- Must have a detailed narrative with the rationale for 4 quads same day (i.e. patient has had past dental office trauma, needed sedation and all tx completed in one visit)
- Patient Convenience and/or scheduling conflicts is NOT a sufficient rationale to get this approved
- Same day SRP - maximum 2 quads, no matter the insurance!
- Make sure that supporting documentation for diagnosis is fantastic.
- Review patient’s benefit breakdown to ensure no other random stipulations like waiting 7-14 days between sides, etc
- First perio maintenance must be minimum of 3 months +1 day after SRP

# Full Quadrant (D4341) vs. Limited SRP (D4342)

- Use D4342 for only 1-3 teeth within the same quadrant that need SRP (probe depths of 5mm or greater)
- Use D4341 for 4+ teeth within the same quadrant that need SRP
---
○ Keep in mind that INSURANCE companies assume/expect that it takes at least 60 minutes PER QUAD when we do SRP.

# When does the patient qualify for periomaintenance cleanings rather than prophylaxis?

○ After receiving SRP on TWO FULL QUADRANTS OR MORE

- ■ D4342 on just one quad will not require subsequent PMV
- ■ TWO quads of D4342…judgment call for subsequent PMV vs Prophy

# Limited SRP (D4342) with Prophy (D1110)

○ If a patient only needs limited SRP on a couple teeth (ONE QUAD ONLY), this will have to be done on a separate appointment after the prophy. YOU CANNOT BILL OUT A PROPHY (OR PERIO MAINTENANCE) IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANY SRP SERVICES.

- ■ NOTE: our policy used to be that we allowed you to perform both on the same day and we’d send an appeal to insurance when the prophy or the srp get denied. We have had multiple appeals denied from multiple insurance companies, so have changed our policy. SRP cannot be done on same day as a prophy or PMV

○ Patient will remain on regular prophy (D1110) cleanings

# Gingivitis Cleaning (D4346)

○ Coverage varies on this code. Many plans do cover at 100%, but some will consider it at 80% with deductible applicable.

○ Some plans will have additional specific criteria such as patient should have no history of cleaning in at least 12-24 months. Some plans use same frequency as other cleanings for this code, where others allow only 1 in 24 months

○ Patient will go back to regular prophy (D1110) afterwards, NOT perio maintenance

# United Concordia

Xrays must show bone loss/ loss of attachment. Full mouth duplicate radiographs or digital images • Full mouth charting, including 6 points per tooth. Clinical loss of periodontal attachment and/or • Radiographic evidence of crestal bone loss or changes in crestal lamina dura and/or • Radiographic evidence of root surface calculus. Bone loss must be evident on xrays to justify the presence of calculus & bacterial deposits on root surfaces

# United Healthcare

Panoramic radiograph or full series • Complete 6 point periodontal charting. Periodontal probing depths of 4-6+ mm with radiographic evidence of horizontal or vertical bone loss • Refractory or recurrent Periodontal Disease • Periodontal abscess

# SRP Denial Protocol:

- Insurance verifier will receive documentation explaining why SRP was denied.
- Insurance verifier will let hygienist know of the denial and set up a time to meet.
- Hygienist will review case and update more detailed documentation for narrative, use editing tool to measure bone loss, and/or circle visible deposits on radiograph with insurance verifier present so they can copy to claim.
---
● Hygienist may also need to help update narrative for bruxism if denial is for NG. If there were additional photos taken of pts recession and abfractions, hygienist may show insurance verifier so they can copy to claim as well.

● Insurance verifier will resubmit claim to insurance.

# Staging

A system used to classify the severity and complexity of periodontal disease. Clinical attachment loss (CAL) loss of connective tissue attachment used in initial staging:

Radiographic bone loss (RBL) the use of X-rays to assess bone loss due to periodontal disease. Tooth loss refers to loss due to periodontal disease.

# Periodontal Guide to Staging / Grading and Treatment

Grading identifies the rate of periodontitis progression, responsiveness to standard therapy; and potential impact on systemic health over time:

Clinicians should initially assume Grade B disease and seek specific evidence to shift to Grade A or C after assessment at subsequent visits.

|Grade A|Grade B|Grade C|
|---|---|---|
|Slow progression rate|Moderate progression rate|Rapid progression rate|
|No change in Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL) or CAL or RBL < 2mm change over 5 years.|CAL or RBL 2mm change over 5 years.| |
|Radiographic Bone Loss (RBL) in the last five years.|Percentage of bone loss by age is 0.25 to 1.0.|Percentage of bone loss by age is > 1.0.|
|Percentage of bone loss by age is < 0.25.|Destruction commensurate with biofilm deposits.|Destruction exceeds expectations given biofilm deposits, specific clinical patterns suggestive of periods of rapid progression and/or early onset disease.|
|Heavy biofilm deposits with low levels of destruction.|Cigarettes per day < 10.|Cigarettes per day > 10.|
|Non-smoker:|HbA1c < 7.0% in patients with diabetes.|HbA1c > 7.0% in patients with diabetes.|
|Does not have diabetes.| | |

# Sealant Protocol:

# When do we do sealants?

On first and second permanent molars for children. No premolars.

# Who does sealants?

1. Hygienist at the appointment they are diagnosed if they have time (Hyg production)
2. If hygienist does not have time doctor and assistant can do them (Doc production)
3. If doctor and hygienist do not have time please schedule at next hygiene visit and allow enough time for cleaning and sealant placement

# Sealant process

All sealant stuff should be in the hygiene bins:

- Including: cheek protectors, cotton rolls, bond brushes, sealant material, curing light, etch and high volume suctions
---
1. See if assistant or another hygienist is available to assist sealants
2. Put high volume suction out and get supplies out of bucket on counter/ tray
3. Put in cheek protector and cotton rolls to isolate the tooth
4. Dry tooth, put etch all over occlusal area of the tooth
5. Leave on for 20 seconds and rinse thoroughly for 20 seconds
6. Dry tooth and place a small amount of sealant material in the fissures
7. Smooth around with a bond brush to make sure it covers all fissures and is not too high
8. Cure with curing light for 20 seconds
9. Check with explorer that it is cured and it all fissures
10. Take out the cheek protector and cotton rolls and give the patient a rinse
11. Floss the tooth to make sure no sealant material got interproximal
12. Make sure bite feels okay to the patient and let them know it will wear down over the next couple weeks

# Getting Patients Numb for Doctor Procedures

- - Hygienist or TC being ready to go for doc
- - Priming the patient for doctor to present TX - especially a few filings or single crown
- - - NP workup in rest certain days. Not Monday and Friday

- Creating Urgency
- - Do not Violate NP & SRP slots when scheduling
- - iTero Scans

# Presenting Simple Treatment (Who? Anyone in the practice should be able to)

- Fillings, Crowns, Extraction, Night Guards
- Exam Sheet vid
- Enter Treatment (prioritize)
- - ***Bridge - check missing tooth clause

Label, date & Save Tx plan in OD

- Hyg
- Use best judgment based on size of Treatment Plan
- For NP doctor exam after cleaning or hygiene perio diagnosis
- Restorative Emergency
- Use emergency workup checklist
- Use the best judgment for TC after signing workup checklist

# Proper Handoff & Checkout

# Same Day Treatment

Makena & Michelle walk us through this…

- Enter Tx Plan
- Present Tx on iPad via Flex (“this is the cost, this is your contracted rate, this is what insurance says they’ll pay, and 400 would be your responsibility”)
- Accepted, signed on iPad
- Doc goes and alerts assistants that we are picking up, identifies Op to Treat in
- Hyg - BP, consents, (possibly topical & anesthetic)

We presented Tx to a patient without a TC & not doing same day…

“Megan I’d like you to meet Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones needs to come back next week with Dr. Matt for 2 fillings, can you go ahead and get that scheduled, Dr. Matt will need 1 hour & we did fluoride today, great to see you Mrs. Jones, have a great day”

This is all said after we have guided Mrs. Jones to sit at checkout.

Patient “needs to check calendar/with spouse” doesn’t schedule

# WHAT OUR IDEAL APPOINTMENT LOOKS LIKE

- Pick up route slip and exam sheet on clipboard at front desk.
- Greet your patient in the waiting area, walk to them and introduce yourself, and welcome them to Green Dental Care.
- Seat patient
- Small talk: ask a few non-dental questions.
- Ask about the patient’s dental concerns and update health history if needed.
- Assessment
- Take x-rays and IO photos if needed. Talk to your patient about any concerns you see after taking these helpful diagnostic tools.
- Perio diagnosis: determine appropriate treatment for the patient.
---
For new patients we take a modified FMX (4 BW, 6 anterior PAs and PAs of posterior implants, endo or concerning teeth), IO photos and do a complete perio chart. For recalls we alternate 4 BW x rays + 2 PAs with perio charting. On your prep sheet it will guide you with what services need to be done today for each patient on your schedule.

With SRPs please grab an assistant or TC to help with consent forms and blood pressure.

# Begin today’s hygiene procedure.

Ask the patient if they would like to do fluoride varnish today for $39. Please go get a treatment coordinator and doctor for an exam with the patient. The treatment coordinator will walk patients up front, get a treatment plan if needed, take payment and schedule recalls.

Clean the room and repeat :)

Please know our staff is very friendly, always willing to help and give the best patient experience. Whenever needed walk up to any staff member in the office and they will help or direct you to the correct person for the job! We hope you have a wonderful day and we appreciate all your hard work.

First check with any hygienist that you know in order to see if they are available on the day and time that we need covered.

If you cannot find anyone then call Dental Temps of the Rockies to give them the day and time that you need a temp. With dental temps of the rockies when they place a temp in our office we owe them a $ 45-50 fee. Once we give them the day and time then they will send us an email of the temp that is coming into our office to confirm. They will send us an email invoice to pay the $45-50 fee. You can call with the credit card and pay over the phone.

Fill out a paper copy of the hygiene prep sheet for the day the temp is coming in. Prepare the room that the temp will be in (water full, tray set up, computer on, etc.) and set the prep sheet on the counter. Have small and medium gloves in the room. Give temp a shield and lab jacket. Have Dr. Green prepare a check for temp at the beginning of the day.

When temp is done for the day: Give the temp the TEMP FORM to fill out. Have Dr. Green sign it and then calculate the total for the day. Take a copy of the check and TEMP FORM.

# Chapter 7

# Patient Education Resources

Poorly aligned teeth can create abnormal lateral forces and stress on surrounding enamel rods and periodontal structures which can lead to abfractions.

# Abfractions

|Abnormal Lateral Contact Point|Normalized Forces|
|---|---|
|Preventing abfractions should include recommending proper tooth alignment with clear aligner therapy to upright the teeth prior to restoring the lesions.| |

# Why wear a night guard?

# Effects of Bruxism

# Healthy Teeth

# Abfraction

# Gum recession

# Attrition

Teeth grinding may cause:

- Chipped enamel
- Flatten, grooved & worn down teeth
- Loosen teeth
- Cracked teeth
- Jaw muscle or joint problems
- Can even cause tooth loss

Some insurance plans may help with the cost of a night guard.

# What happens after a Deep Cleaning?

# Periodontal Maintenance Cleanings

Every 3-4 months / Remission period

# What about my free cleaning?

A normal cleaning is a preventative measure: We cannot prevent periodontal disease when periodontal disease is already there: We need to treat and maintain!

# Potential out of pocket cost

Periodontal Disease affects your body and overall health

200 million Americans have heart attacks or strokes annually

50% of Cardiovascular Disease are related to oral conditions, at least doubles the rest of CVD events

Periodontal Disease is the #1 form of chronic inflammation and inflammation is the #1 destabilizer of plaque in blood vessels

# ORAL HYGIENE AND YOUR HEALTH

With increasing research indicating that one's periodontal health may be related to overall health, never has it been more important to ensure the health of your teeth and gums. You cannot be healthy, unless you are periodontally healthy.

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# TRADITIONAL DENTURES

Traditional dentures have been around for a long time. Unfortunately, this restorative option can make it difficult to eat. Since dental implants have become so popular, dentures are now considered below standard care. Those who use traditional dentures have seen a huge loss of gum and bone support in their mouth. This leads to premature aging, facial drooping, and sagging.

# ADVANTAGES

- Least Expensive Option
- Can Improve Aesthetics
- Better Than Nothing At All

# DISADVANTAGES

- Hard to Eat With
- Not Secure
- Feels Bulky
- Loss of Taste; Temperature Sensations
- Must be Relined & Repaired
- Causes Bone Loss Over Time

# GREEN DENTAL

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# IMPLANT SNAP-ON DENTURES

Implant snap-on dentures have become a popular solution to replacing missing teeth. Patients love this option because the denture snaps into place; unlike traditional dentures, implant snap-on dentures are more secure and less bulky. Additionally, they don't cover the roof of the mouth. The denture can be easily removed for cleaning. With this option, patients prevent further bone loss, premature aging, and facial sagging.

# ADVANTAGES

- Most Affordable Implant Option
- Better Than Traditional Dentures
- Prevents Bone Loss & Premature Aging
- Improves Ability to Taste

# DISADVANTAGES

- There Is Some Movement
- Comes Out At Night

# PERFORMANCE

$15,000 For 4 Implant Overdenture

Includes all costs except extractions

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# IMPLANT-SUPPORTED PERMANENT TEETH

Implant-supported teeth include a screwed-in dental bridge. A full set of upper or lower teeth are permanently attached to the dental implants; which gives patients the look, feel, and function of natural teeth. The bridge can only be removed by the dentist once per year. Implant-supported bridges are the most natural solutions available.

# ADVANTAGES

- Strong & Reliable Material
- Looks & Feels Natural
- Restores Biting & Chewing Function
- Long-Term Solution
- Prevents Bone Loss & Premature Aging

# DISADVANTAGES

- May Be Difficult to Clean
- Requires Maintenance Over Time
- Treatment is Costly

# FOR PATIENTS THAT HAVE ALOT OF SENSITIVITY To TEMPERATURE (MOSTLY COLD)

GLUMA Desensitizer achieves its effects by precipitation of plasma proteins, which reduces dentinal permeability and occludes the peripheral dentinal tubules. This inhibits the flow of fluid through the tubules which is the cause of sensitivity.

Apply the minimum amount of GLUMA Desensitizer required to the dentine surface to be treated by using an applicator tip, brush or similar. Gently massage in for approx. 30 to 60 seconds. Then dry the surface carefully in an air stream until the liquid film has disappeared and the surface is no longer shiny.

Tip: It can take up to a couple of hours until the optimum desensitizing effect is achieved. If a single application of GLUMA Desensitizer does not produce sufficient and sustained pain relief, the treatment can be repeated at the same or subsequent appointment before alternative treatments are used.
