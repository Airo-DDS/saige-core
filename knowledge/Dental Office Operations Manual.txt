# How to Use this Manual

If you’ve purchased this, then you already believe that there are some things in your dental practice that you can improve. You might know that you should do something to systemize your business, but just don’t know how to do that. Good news- this book holds the keys and examples to everything you want to do in your practice!

Over the past few years, we’ve seen practices that are disorganized and chaotic. Instruments are not ever put on the tray the same way twice. Or some employees do things ‘this way’, and other employees do it ‘my way’. Good news- It doesn’t have to be this way! This book is a guide-post for what you should have in your office to help the team understand your expectations of them, as well as examples for what you should have to help run your dental practice with better systemization. If you can copy just half of these systems and replicate them to your own practice, then you will be way ahead of most other practices.

These documents and systems are not new ideas. They are ideas started by visionaries, shared, improved, and passed on. Our job is to continue the practice of passing them on so that they can continue to improve dentists’ practices and make your business less stressful and chaotic. It is with great thanks that we recognize dental rock-stars like Dr. Summer Kassmel, Dr. Jason Tanoory, and many other ‘Black-Belt’ coaches we work with. This manual also would not be possible without our assistant Nicole- an amazing assistant who is the real all-star of the project.

If this example manual speaks to you and this is the sort of thing that gets you excited, then you might really enjoy the private dentist-only community that we’ve created at the Dental Success Network. As part of membership, we have many other documents and spreadsheets shared inside DSN that come with membership.

# Systemization Scorecard

When we work with dentists, we always start with a self-evaluation. As we start this journey of systemization with you, we would like you to complete it as well. Below is a complete checklist to help you see where you might need to improve. In each section, there are also sub-set checklists to focus on the strategies in that section. Go through this checklist to see how you measure up. Watch introduction video →

# Foundation

- ☐ We have defined the Mission Statement for our practice.

---
# Cash Flow and Overhead Control

- We are aware of the profession’s ideal expense percentages and understand that elevated expenses in any category decrease the owner’s profit.
- We focus on profitability as our number one KPI secondary to productions, collections, and new patients.
- We understand that debt is acceptable if it is leveraged to create more profit, not just more revenue. We also understand that incurring debt to purchase depreciating assets that do not generate a profitable ROI will decrease the owner’s net worth and cash flow.
- We set hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, adjusted production, collections, new patients and profitability benchmarks.
- We track our KPI’s from month to month and year to year.

# Hiring, Firing and OnBoarding

- We have a systemized process for recruiting and vetting potential new team members.
- We have a systemized process for training and on-boarding all new team members.
- We have clearly defined the benchmarks and expectations for all new team members set for 30, 60, and 90 days of hire date.
- We have bi-monthly performance reviews and self-assessments during the 90 day “Get Acquainted” period.
- We are clear with our new team member of expectations and consequences for underperformance.
- We have a systematic process for firing any team member.

# Score Calculation

After completing the entire checklist, add up all the completed checks and then calculate a percentage score. Put that score below:

Total Items Completed: ____ / 45

Percentage Score: ______

Belt Status: ______________________
---
# Use the chart below to grade yourself:

| |Assessment Score|Overhead Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|Phase 0 (White Belt)|Less than 40%|Above 60%|
|Phase 1 (Blue Belt)|40% - 60%|56% - 60%|
|Phase 2 (Brown Belt)|61% - 79%|51% - 55%|
|Phase 3 (Black Belt)|80% - 100%|Below 50%|

Typically we see most dental practice owners start below 40% systemization. If you have taken this test and have a score close to zero, do not sweat it! Many people start there. The good news is that using the resources in this book will get you up to the ‘Black-Belt’ phase quickly as long as you develop the habits to form these systems every day.

You might be wondering, “What does Black-Belt mean?” In the Dental Success Institute’s Elite Practice Mastermind, we use the ‘Black Belt’ moniker as the gold standard for what we all hope to achieve. This means that a dentist’s practice has an over 80% systemization score and a below 50% overhead number. In essence, a doctor is taking home half of all their revenues if they are the only doctor in the practice.

We also have many doctors who do not do much clinical, and in these cases the dentists are still making 20-30% profit on the practice without even seeing patients.

As you progress through this book, use it as a resource to help you attack each section and get a better systemization score over time. Nothing happens overnight, but we are excited to help you get all the value out of this book and become more systemized!

# Foundational Principles

To have a successful practice, you need to have a vision of what that looks like. This isn’t a fuzzy vision in the future, but a clear picture of how the practice looks in 5 to 10 years.

Watch the video introduction to this section on Foundation →

This foundation is important for many reasons. First and foremost, it needs to be a guiding light for you as the visionary and business owner. It’s also important for your team to understand as it can greatly impact morale and teamwork. We have personally seen team members on the brink of termination that completely flipped after learning more about the vision and core values.

# The Foundation is broken down into three distinct pieces:

# Mission

The mission of the organization is what your company actually does. It should be short and easy to memorize. Your mission statement should also be specific enough that people understand what you do and how it may differ from your competitors. In the dental world it will surely be very similar to many other dentists, but you should spend a good deal of time to see that it is accurate to the style of dentistry you want to provide, as well as unique to your practice.

Remember that the mission is OUTWARD facing, and should be used in marketing as a differentiating factor and something that you’re proud to show off.
---
# Vision

This is what your company aspires to be; which can be much different than what a company is (mission statement). When done right, your vision statement can and should help drive decisions and goals in your company. Sometimes, it is best to think about a 10 year goal and actually put numbers into the Vision statement to understand the vision more clearly.

As you go through vision-planning and goal setting, it will be interesting to see how any current staff members react to it. Some will be energized and excited to help you achieve it. Others may be totally put-off by the vision, and that is okay! It is better to let certain staff members off the bus now before you get too far down the road and use up years of their life where they could be in a more perfect fit.

# Core Values

Core values are what support the vision, shape the culture, and reflect what your company values. They are your company’s principles, beliefs, or philosophy of values.

We often say that if the boss is away, the core values should give you the rules to handle any situation. It’s sort of like the laws of your practice, similar to the laws of the city or state. In the case where you don’t know what should be done or how it should be done, you look at the laws. Similar to your business, the core values are the laws of how things are done.

We suggest limiting your core values between three and seven values total. Once you get beyond this it’s hard for your employees to remember. Remember to keep them simple, and make sure these core values are used in your recruitment process, your on-boarding process, and accountability agreements. If someone isn’t following the core values, or makes choices constantly in contradiction to the core values, then it might be time to part ways with that employee.

# Example #1:

# Mission:

Our mission is to be the most community-oriented dental practice in the state. We will accomplish this through radical generosity and by building our foundation on a patient base we call family.

# Vision:

Our vision is to have expertly trained doctors, a close-knit staff, and a growing business that supports all its employees at 3-4 locations.

# Core Values:

- Fantastic guest experience
- Always be improving
---
# Hungry & Humbly confident

# Have each other’s back

# Example #2:

# From the Practice of Dr. Summer Kassmel: Castle Peak Dental in Avon, Colorado

# Mission Statement

At Example Dental, our mission is to provide a “wow” experience with customized care every visit.

# Vision Statement

At Example Dental, we are committed to providing total health and wellness utilizing the latest technology, products and knowledge. In order to serve our patients optimally, Example Dental will always be growth oriented in services provided and hours. As one of our core values, consistently seeking better and more efficient systems as well as new opportunities to expand our practices is vitally important to Example Corp.

# Core Values

1. Servant’s Heart: Serve patients and team before me. We strive to “WOW” every patient, every visit, every time.
2. Accountability: Failure will happen with an empowered team, but we take ownership and come up with solutions.
3. Respectful: We will respectfully communicate with patients and team members, ALWAYS.
4. Growth-Minded: We will continue learning and looking for new ways to improve ourselves and our practice.
5. Gratitude, Gratitude and Grace: We are not entitled to anything, but by God’s grace we are thankful for it all.
6. Disciplined and Professional: Patients will feel not only our warmth, but that we are healthcare professionals that take the job seriously. We are the experts.
7. Humor: Life is too short not to find daily joy and laughter.

# Core Values Creation Exercise

Gino Wickman, the Author of Traction and Get a Grip, has done the best job of anyone to describe how to find your core values. We use his philosophy as the baseline, and built our model off his starting point. We suggest to find your core values, follow these two steps:

# Step 1: Envision your ‘Dream Team’

This is preferably an existing team member, but if necessary it can be a past member, a colleague’s team member, or a composite of your version of the perfect employee per position.

# Step 2: List out the characteristics and traits that the ‘Dream Team’ embodies:
---
# List out per position:

- Office Manager
- Associate Doctor
- Hygienist
- Front Office
- Back Office
- Treatment Coordinator
- Other Positions

# Steps to Define Core Values

1. Circle the Traits above that really resonate with you and are the highest priority. Draw a line through the ones that are not.
2. Reduce them to a list with a maximum of 7 core values, and a minimum of 3.
3. Integrate Core Values into a Sentence: “We strive to….” “We always….” List them on the Foundations/Growth Worksheet and Team Cultural Assessment.

After defining all your mission, vision and core values, it is then important to post these in a very visible place, and make an accountability for each team member to commit the foundational principles to memory. We have found that when team members have the values memorized and they are discussed frequently, the team starts to hold each other accountable to those values. As they all hold each other accountable, there will be a new baseline that drives productivity and positivity.

# Checklist to complete for Foundational Principles:

- ☐ We have defined the Mission Statement for our practice.
- ☐ We have defined the Vision Statement for our practice.
- ☐ We have defined our Core Values for our practice.
- ☐ We have posted these foundational principles in a prominent place as well as in the Operations Manual.
- ☐ We have made it an accountability for each team member to commit the foundational principles to memory.
- ☐ We ensure that each team member has committed to living and working by these principles while in the practice.
- ☐ We regularly review the foundational principles to keep them relevant and modify them when they cease to inspire and motivate the team.

# Operational Systemization

There’s a reason that a McDonald’s Big Mac is the same whether you buy it in New York City or York, Nebraska. It’s different people, different states, but they all follow the same process to get to the same end result. Your dental practice needs to be exactly like this. We’ve cataloged all the processes that are important for you to focus on here. Below is a list that excludes the Human Resources component, which will be addressed later.

# Procedure Setups

As you continue making your operations manual, you will want to make templates and/or instructional documents for how you want each procedure setup. This can be from a very simple Problem Focused Exam all the way to a complicated Implant and Sedation setup.

The image below is from Dr. Doug Moorehead, a multiple practice owner near Cincinnati, Ohio. For each procedure, there is a spot for each of the needed items for that specific procedure. It is very easy to then teach new team members how to set up for each procedure, but it is also easy to see missing items for veteran team members at a quick glance.

Usually, you can print and laminate pictures and listed items to keep in a folder, but not everyone learns well that way. An even more systemized approach is to laminate cardstock or have sheets made that fit the exact size of your countertop. Dr. Aaron Nicholas of Burtonsville, Maryland teaches to use large sheets exactly sized to your countertop to maximize efficiency. He would know, as he’s the creator and teacher of the 1-Hour Molar Root Canal Buildup and Crown. Check out his information at www.MondayMorningDentistry.com. One of the biggest advantages of using a sheet like this is that the
---
procedure is done the same way every time. As it is done more frequently, time is saved and each part of the ‘machine’ knows exactly what is next. This routine creates efficiency.

Dr. Doug Morehead numbers and keeps his laminated sheets nearby in case a team member is setting up for a procedure they are unfamiliar with.

While teaching new team members accountable is a benefit, we actually recommend doing these for efficiency’s sake. Once you start doing things the same way for each patient, each doctor, each assistant; the practice becomes better.

# Checklist to complete:

- ☐ Problem Focused Exam Setup
- ☐ Endodontic Setup
- ☐ Restorative Setup
- ☐ Crown Prep Setup
- ☐ Crown Seat Setup
- ☐ Implant Setup
- ☐ Extraction Setup
- ☐ Laminated for each procedure

Next are a few examples of the Picture and List format (the easiest to begin with). As you become more sophisticated, you can use applications like LucidChart or Canva to build your templates.

# Pro Tip:

When looking at each exam setup and procedure setup, take note and keep track of all the supplies that are used in each procedure. This will help later on when you do a ‘Cost Per Procedure’ analysis- knowing exactly how many gauze, impression tips, and other materials that go into a procedure.

# Bur Block Setups

There are a myriad of ways to store burs and make sure they are sharp and clean. In many practices we see, the best practice is to keep a couple different sets of bur blocks and have them sterilized and ready to be used when needed. Doctors will usually have different bur blocks for root canals, crown preparations, or operative.

The advantages of separate bur blocks for each procedure are that they are only opened and sterilized when needed. Running a bur block through the sterilizer dulls and can start to rust burs, so it really should be avoided to sterilize them too many times. Replace any burs that are rusting or have buildup on them.

Here is an example of a bur block if you tried to put as many burs onto one block as possible. This includes operative burs as well as crown prep burs.

In this practice, the image was laminated and posted right next to the sterilizer so that everyone knows exactly what should go on the block.

The picture here shows the smallest clear tip-out bins that are used to keep burs. The tip-out bins can be purchased from Amazon or directly from the manufacturer at Simplastics. These bins are 9-wide, and then you can stack them as needed to match exactly what you have in a bur block.

# Checklist to complete:

- ☐ Pick out top burs to use - keep it to 27 or less
- ☐ Set up ideal bur block for each procedure - create document
- ☐ Laminate key and hang in Sterilization
- ☐ Get Tip-out bins to match

# Sterilization Schedules

Sterilization is one thing that is vitally important to a functioning dental office. If your sterilizer malfunctions or breaks, it can shut down the entire office until it is fixed. It is imperative that you have a clear understanding of the maintenance and schedule for each piece of equipment, and have that posted in the sterilization area to make sure each job gets completed accurately every day, week, and month.

# Sterilization Schedule

# Daily: Morning

- Get out clean towels for counters by ultrasonic and packaging area
- Fill ultrasonic
- Remove any sterile instruments from autoclave
- Wipe down sterilizer
- Turn on vacuum and compressor

# Daily: Night

- Start sterilizer if needed
- Drain ultrasonic
- Place dirty towels in laundry basket
- Wipe down counters
- Shut off vacuum and compressor

# Weekly:

- Test sterilizers every Monday after running one cycle first
- Drain sterilizer and fill with clean water on Thursday at the end of the day

# Monthly:

- Deep clean both sterilizers at the beginning of every month. (See sterilizer manual for those instructions if needed.)

# Checklist to complete:

- ☐ Create Sterilization Schedule
- ☐ Laminate and hang in Sterilization

# Dental Supply Ordering

# Purchasing Supplies

When was the last time you took a good look at how much you’re spending on supplies? Do you know what percentage of your net production you spend each month?

Dentistry is built on relationships, and we often fall into the natural habit of giving our favorite sales rep the bulk of our supply business on the premise that they’re going to hook you up with the friends and family deal. Having a local rep that you can rely on in a pinch is great, but the reality is that they too have a quota to reach, and that extra 2 or 3% you spend each year can add up to as much as $30,000 if you’re a million dollar practice.

The reality is that it is in the best interest of the team to constantly check across suppliers and diligently compare price creep each month. Don’t be afraid to switch out non-critical supplies out to house brands, and consider joining a GPO (Group Purchasing Organization) that can provide you with a preferred supplier formulary. Note that there are some GPO’s out there that will lock you into a contract and charge you a percentage of collections. Never, ever commit to one of these organizations, as you will want the flexibility to pick and choose your formulary based on what is in YOUR best interest.

What we learned from the pandemic is that the cost of doing business will vary based on supply, demand, and logistics. This means even if you had a great pricing agreement with Supplier X before the pandemic, it may not be so great if they’ve been pinched by their own manufacturer agreements or negotiated poor chargebacks. Buy your supplies as if you were shopping for your own personal items. Research, compare, and don’t be afraid to switch vendors if needed.

One of our favorite suppliers is PureLife Dental out of Santa Monica, CA. For one, we LOVE the fact that they will manage any “Buy One Get One” specials or rebates automatically for you, so you don’t have to kick yourself in the butt 3 months from now when you forget to send in your shipping manifest to claim that rebate. I recently forgot to fax (yes…they wanted a fax) in my claim for a buy 6 get 6 in-house whitening kits, and I haven’t forgiven myself for it.

Second, their pricing is fair, if not better than many of the other GPO formularies. We first learned about them when we were shopping for an amalgam separator. Somehow they were charging only $199 for a unit that others were charging thousands for. After learning more about their ethos and commitment to sustainability (they strive to be a carbon neutral company), combined with fast shipping and a preferred formulary through the Dental Success Network, we switched over approximately 45% of our business to PureLife, and ultimately helped bring our supply overhead to 3-4% of our monthly net production. As I write this, their auto-ship glove program brings down the price of nitrile gloves to $7.49, while the other
---
Major suppliers are still charging $16.99 (aka pandemic pricing). While there is no local rep to buy us lunch, those savings are passed to us, and I don’t carry the guilt of needing to buy something just because my Big 3 rep dropped by with a couple of pizzas.

Purelife Dental has also given Dental Success Network Members a special homepage, as seen here:

Another perk is their PureRewards program. In our office we save the points and use them towards employee gift cards as team incentives.

We also believe in doing business with friends when possible, so if you want to “meet” Omar Al-Midani, we recommend listening to his podcast episode with Dr. Mark Costes. In this episode you'll hear more about how the supply business works, Purelife’s ethos, and Omar’s journey from an MIT Aerospace Engineer to CEO of PureLife Dental.

# Goal of Percentages:

Dental supplies is one of the biggest areas where we see overspending in a dental practice. While we always encourage dentists to keep this area at around 4 to 4.5% of revenues, we commonly see these categories at around 7 to 9%. This means that sometimes 9% of your revenues is taken up by a category that should be a very small percentage of your practice.

This almost always happens because the leadership of the practice isn’t aware of the possibilities, or they do not watch the spending category with a close eye. Below, we show you two spreadsheets that can help get you to that coveted 4% number, and we will also explain exactly how to achieve it.

1. Set a goal
1. Setting the goal is easy, but don’t try to set the goal too strictly at the beginning. Look at previous Profit and Loss Statements to see where you are currently at. If you’re at 8%, try to cut it by 1% each of the next few months until you are down near 4%.
2. As for setting the percentage, look for an average of the last 3 months revenues. Once you average the last 3 months, then apply your percentage to that, and you will have your target number for your total dental supply spend.
---
c. When you can break these targets: Some practices have a 3-D milling unit and buy blocks. If you do this, usually those blocks and equipment goes into the ‘lab fees’ category, not the dental supply. However, if your accountant puts them in dental supplies, just make sure to acknowledge and adjust accordingly. Another time when you can have difficulty setting this budget is when you are growing rapidly, or have wide fluctuations in production and collections. In these cases, give yourself some slack and make sure that you are not keeping your budget too low. Sometimes trying to be too strict on the budget leads to not ordering enough supplies, and then you can be caught without the supplies to actually do these procedures.

# 2. Get a formulary together

a. A Formulary is a list of things that you like to order. Shared below is a spreadsheet that was shared on the Dental Success Network. Dr. Christopher Green is a Black Belt Coach and startup expert in Denver, Colorado. His ordering formulary took a few hours to put together, but it compares the prices among multiple different companies, and only includes the items that he actually uses.

Make sure to check out prices with PureLife Dental: We have seen some of the best prices through this Preferred-Vendor relationship with DSN Members. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, gloves and masks have skyrocketed, but the prices here are the lowest we have seen.

b. To start- find the most commonly ordered items in your office. This list seems like it could be long, but in reality it is most likely about 150 items. 90% of your ordering is within this list, and the remaining 10% of your orders are spread out over another 250 items. Usually dental practices have their total formulary at about 400 items.

c. Once you have all the items listed out, then you can go to a few different places to see where the best prices are. Sometimes it might mean switching brands from name-brand items to generic or ‘house brand’ items. This is acceptable, but just keep track of what you are comparing. In the attached formulary, we provide a space for you to enter the SKU number so that you always keep track of what you might order in case that price is the best. Quick note: pass this task along to a trusted team member to manage the formulary and price-checking for you. Find that team member who is price-conscious already, and they will love saving you money on dental supplies.

d. Sometimes a software solution may be better for you, and Dentira is one that we have found recently on the Dental Success Network that has been extremely popular. Dentira will automatically check multiple manufacturers and warehouses to find you the best price on an item.

# 3. Track towards the goal

a. As you start spending money each month on dental supplies, make sure to keep exact track of the order each time you place an order with any company. Use the attached
---
spreadsheets to put the date, what supplies were ordered, the order number, and total expected expenses.

b. Of course, when you actually receive the order, sometimes the bill is actually slightly different from the expected charges, either due to shipping or price changes. Remember to put the actual financial implications in the ‘final’ line.

c. At the top of each section, put your budget for the month. At a $100,000 a month practice, that would be 4%, or $4,000. The top line states, $4,000, and then below it you put all the final charges. Once they are in there, the order will be subtracted from the top number, and then you will have your remaining spend available.

# 4. Measure your success

a. At the end of the month, once your bookkeeper accounts for all supplies, you will then have the final number of what you spent during that month. Each month part of your ‘CEO Time’ should be spent looking at all costs to see whether you are tracking towards your goal of staying at the stated goal of close to 4% dental supply spend.

# Checklist to complete:

- ☐ Set a % goal for your supply budget
- ☐ Create a complete formulary for your practice
- ☐ Check prices among all vendors (DSN has special pricing for members)
- ☐ Track each purchase and mark against your budget as you buy supplies
- ☐ Measure your success on your P&L at the end of each month

# Standard Operating Procedures

The next few pages offer examples of documents that are helpful and needed in any practice that wants to be systemized. These standard operating procedures, or SOPs for short, are pictures and instructions for how your practice does things. These procedures should be so detailed that anyone could walk into your practice and do things how you do them.

To execute these SOPs well, remember that the dentist should not be the one writing or creating these. These are for team use, and the team knows best on how things are done. To accomplish this task with the least amount of stress, find the team member who knows each set of processes best. There will be processes that you don’t even know about, so best to ask them to start writing a list first. This list should be comprehensive, and remind them that even things they think are ‘stupid’ are still worthwhile to put into the SOPs. If they know each process best, assign them the task of taking pictures and writing instructions for how to do a task.

It is then your task to check their work and make sure that it follows the same format as the rest of the SOPs that are created. In many cases, we have seen people use Google Drive for keeping all these documents together.

# Checklist to complete:

- ☐ Gather a list of all processes in the practice (focus on just one area to start)
- ☐ Ask a team member to draft each System Document
- ☐ Check their work for accuracy and make sure entire team is in agreement

- 2+ vials depending on what it will be used for (membrane, sticky bone, plug or all 3)
- Always draw an even number of vials or place an empty vial in the centrifuge for balance

Assistant: IMMEDIATELY take and spin blood in the centrifuge
---
# PRF Membrane:

- Spin in centrifuge for 10-12 mins at 3300 RPM
- Once ending….let it slow down on it’s own
- There will be 1-2mm of red blood cells left in the bottom of the vial
- The blood will be separated into 3 components: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets
- The fibrin clot/PRF/snot clot can be pulled from the vial with cotton/tissue pliers
- Separate the white fibrin clot from the red blood cells at the bottom
- Open PRF box and place clots on slotted underboard
- Use the press board to flatten down clots into 1mm thick (box has stopper for accuracy) membranes
- Let sit for 5-7 mins
---
# PRF Plug (Same as Membrane):

- Spin in centrifuge for 10-12 mins at 3300 RPM
- Once ending….let it slow down on it’s own
- Place the fibrin clots inside of the cylindrical tube molds within the PRF box
- Place the piston on top of the clots
- Let sit for 5-7 mins

50

# Clinical Help Documents

The next section includes a few documents that are helpful when providing patient care. These documents help increase data capture, and help improve the patient experience by having a smoother flow of information between the patient and the team.

# Documents given in example:

1. Problem Focused Exam Worksheet
This worksheet is just a blank page, but it helps record applicable tests that we do in our offices. It is printed and ready for the assistant to write down information quickly by hand when the doctor is doing the exam. It can then be scanned into the patient’s chart at the end of the exam.
2. Nerve Injury Mapping
Sometimes anesthetic or extractions will cause nerve injury. In this scenario, it is best to track the sensations and paresthesia over time so that you know exactly what is going on. In the cases where you might need to refer to a specialist, this information is very handy. Also, in the cases where you might be in litigation, these sheets help protect you immensely from a judgement against you.
3. TMD Self Care
These are example instructions that can be given to patients after you diagnose them with some sort of Temporo-mandibular disorder. It contains all the different remedies, and usually we cross out or highlight the ones we suggest for patients to use.
4. Periodontal Scorecard
This is a tri-fold brochure made beautifully by our friends at myCMOshare Marketing. This was based on the work of Dr. Deren Flesher at Royal Oak Family Dentistry in Oklahoma. He created and refined the scorecard as a way to systemize and assess the risk factors for periodontal disease in his patients. As you progress through the scorecard, anyone can put numbers and figure out whether the patient might be warranted for a deeper look at needing scaling and root planing or some other periodontal intervention. While it is not diagnostic, it surely does help and it explains to the patient what is leading you to your diagnosis.
5. BOTOX Consent
Remember to have consents for each of the procedures that warrant it, including extractions, root canals, implants, dentures, veneers, and BOTOX.
6. BOTOX Post-Op
Most complex procedures should have post-op instructions for them, including extractions, implants, all-on-X procedures, and BOTOX.

# TMD Self Care

We use our mouths for so many activities (talking, eating, yawning, laughing, etc.) and when we are not engaged in these, we need to allow our jaw muscles and joints to relax. Many people have developed habits that do not permit their muscles or joints to relax a sufficient amount of time. The following will help instruct you on how to relax your jaw muscles and joints to reduce the jaw pain you are having:

- Apply moist heat, ice or a combination of heat and ice to the painful areas, most people prefer heat but if that increases your pain, use the combination or just the ice. Moist heat and ice are probably the most popular, quickest, and cheapest things you can do to relieve jaw pain right now. Most TMJ disorders, facial pain patients have a preference of whether ice or heat works best for them, so in the beginning, experiment with both to see what relieves the most pain.
- USE OF HEAT: Use moist heat for 20 minutes two or four times each day. Moist heat can be obtained by wetting a towel with very warm water. It also can be re-warmed in a microwave oven or under very warm water. In addition, one can wrap it around a hot water bottle or heating pad. Be careful not to burn yourself. Many TMD sufferers use heat before doing jaw exercises or physical therapy to make sure the muscles are loose.
- USE OF A COMBINATION OF HEAT AND ICE: Use the combination of heat and ice two to four times each day. Apply heat as recommended above for 10 minutes then lightly brush the painful area with an ice cube wrapped in a thin washcloth. Repeat this sequence four or five times a day.
- USE OF ICE: Apply ice wrapped in a thin washcloth to the painful area until you first feel some numbness, then remove it (usually takes about 5 minutes).
- Eat soft foods like casseroles, canned fruit, soups, eggs, yogurt, etc. Do not chew gum or eat hard (raw carrots) or chewy foods (caramels, steak, bagels, etc.). Cut other food into small pieces, evenly divide the food on both sides of your mouth and chew on both sides.
- Rest your jaw muscles by keeping your teeth apart and practicing good posture.
- Your teeth should never touch except lightly when you swallow. Remember the rule: "Lips together, teeth apart". Closely monitor yourself for the habit of clenching that you may have developed. People will often do this when they are driving the car or concentrating. Try to keep your jaw relaxed by placing your tongue lightly behind your upper front teeth, having your jaw in a comfortable position with your teeth apart and relaxing your jaw muscles.
- Good neck, head, and back posture help you have good jaw posture. Try to hold your head up straight and use a small pillow or rolled towel to support your lower back. Avoid habits such as resting your jaw on your hand or cradling the telephone against your shoulder.
- Easy exercises that gently stretch your jaw muscles can be an effective management tool for TMD. Stretch your muscles by slowly opening your mouth as widely as you can without feeling pain. Very carefully, use your fingers on your lower teeth to push your mouth open a little more. If it starts to hurt, stop, but continue to challenge yourself a little bit at a time. Your muscles will relax and loosen up, which can decrease the pain significantly.
- If you don't feel better with hot or cold compresses, jaw relaxation techniques, or jaw exercises, it's perfectly acceptable to take the edge off TMJ pain with pain medications. An anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen is usually used for TMD, but may irritate your stomach if you use it on a long-term basis. If this is the case or if you are not able to take ibuprofen, try acetaminophen, which is gentler on your stomach. Do not use over-the-counter anti-inflammatories for more than 2 weeks, and follow all prescription guidelines. If pain persists, see your dentist immediately as treatment may require the use of splint therapy or more complex surgical procedures.

# CONSENT TO BOTOX BOTULINUM TOXIN “A” TREATMENT

Patient ____________________________________________

Date of Birth ___________________

Address ______________________________________________________

Phone_________________________

Botox is a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium *Clostridium A*. Botox can relax muscles on areas of the face and neck which cause wrinkles associated with facial expressions. Areas most frequently treated are:

1. Glabellar area of frown lines, located between the eyes
2. Crow’s feet (lateral areas of the eyes)
3. Forehead wrinkles.

Botox is diluted to a very controlled solution and when injected into the muscles with a very thin needle, it is almost painless. Clients may feel slight burning sensation while the solution is being injected. The procedure takes about 15-20 minutes and the results lasts 3-6 months. With repeated treatments, the results may tend to last longer.

Initial ____________________

# RISKS AND COMPLICATIONS

It has been explained to me that there are certain inherent and potential risks and side effects in any invasive procedure and in the specific instance such risks include but are not limited to:

1. Post treatment discomfort, swelling, redness, and bruising
2. Double vision
3. A weakened tear duct
4. Post treatment bacterial, and/or fungal infection requiring further treatment
5. Allergic reaction
6. Minor temporary droop of eyelids in approximately 2% of injection, this usually lasts 2-3 weeks
7. Occasional numbness of the forehead lasting 2-3 weeks
8. Transient headache
9. Flu-like symptoms may occur

# PAYMENT

I understand that this is an “elective” cosmetic procedure. I understand that payment is my responsibility and is expected at the time of treatment.

Initial ____________________

# RIGHT TO DISCONTINUE TREATMENT

I understand that I have the right to discontinue treatment at any time.

Initial ____________________

# ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES

Alternatives to the procedures and options that I have volunteered for have been fully explained to me.

# RESULTS

I am aware that when small amounts of purified outline (“BOTOX”) are injected into the muscle it causes weakness or paralysis of that muscle. This appears in 2 - 10 days. It usually lasts 3-6 months but can be shorter or longer. In a very small number of individuals, the injection does not work satisfactorily or for as long as usual. There are some individuals who do not respond at all. I understand that I will not be able to “frown” while the injection is effective, but that this will reverse after a period of months at which time re-treatment is appropriate. I understand that I must stay in the erect posture and that I must not manipulate the area(s) of the injections for the 2 hours post-injection period.

I am aware that full correction is important and that follow-up enhancement treatments will be needed to maintain the full effects. I am aware that the duration of treatment is dependent on many factors including but not limited to: age, sex, tissue conditions, my general health and lifestyle conditions including sun exposure. The correction, depending on these factors, may last 3-6 months and in some cases shorter and some cases longer. I have been instructed in and understand post-instructions and have been given a copy of them.

I hereby voluntarily consent to treatment. The procedure(s) have been explained to me. I have read the above and I understand. My questions have been answered satisfactorily. I accept risks and complications of the procedure. I certify that if I have any changes in my medical history, I will notify the office.

# BOTOX COSMETICS POST TREATMENT INSTRUCTIONS

The guidelines to follow post treatment have been followed for years and are still employed today to prevent the possible side effects of ptosis (drooping of the eyelids). These measures should minimize the possibility of ptosis.

- No straining, heavy lifting, vigorous exercise for 3-4 hours following treatment. It is now known that it takes the toxin approximately 2 hours to bind itself to the nerve to start its work, because we do not want to increase circulation to that area to wash away the Botox from where it was injected.
- Avoid manipulation of the area for 3-4 hours following treatment, (For the same reasons listed above.) This includes not doing a facial, peel, or microdermabrasion. It can be done in the same appointment only if they are done before the Botox.
- Facial exercises in the injected areas are recommended for one hour following treatment. This is to stimulate the binding of the toxin only to the localized area.
- It can take 2-10 days to take full effect. It is recommended that the patient contact the office no later than 2 weeks after treatment if desired effect was not achieved and no sooner to give the toxin time to work.
- Makeup may be applied before leaving the office.

12. Insurance Estimates
13. Pre-Authorization
14. Submitting Claims
15. Using Verrific
16. Revenue Cycle Management

When we get together with our private clients in Mastermind Meetings, we always bring up two exercises that help us figure out all the documents we need to create in the office.

1. Follow the Patient
1. During this exercise, we encourage finding each patient interaction throughout the life-cycle and appointment-cycle of the patient. This includes the first phone call or online scheduling. After a patient schedules an appointment, what does the online paperwork look like? What does the appointment confirmation protocol look like? How are they greeted at the front desk the first time? What does the waiting room greeting and office tour look like prior to seating them? How does the check-out and reappointment process look?
2. After finding all these questions- use them as the guidance to creating documents and SOPs
2. Follow the Dollar

# Financial Systems in Practice

Similarly, use this thinking to help you find what systems need to be created for the financial side of the practice. How do we verify insurance? What does the collections and checkout look like? What does the payment menu include? How and when do we send statements? How do we estimate insurance payments? How do we send pre-authorizations?

# Scheduling Protocol

Protocol: The schedule is meant to flow, we want to continue a smooth flow and see our patients on time; in order to accomplish that, we must follow the scheduling templates and protocols. This gives every patient the best guest experience we can offer!

See the short book Be Our Guest by the Disney Corporation for a quick 85 page read on ‘Guest Experience’!

# How to:

- Schedule should always be set to 10 minute increments
- Dr. Time = X Assistant time = O
- Never schedule “DR” time next to “DR” time; you will run behind and your patients will be largely affected, their experience will not be what you intended it to be - we want all of our patients' time to be valued and we want them to know that. Patients will appreciate that you are taking the other patients around them into consideration when scheduling their appointments.
- Always schedule for what works best for YOUR schedule; the patients will mold their personal schedule around your openings that you offer.
- Ask what works best for their schedule to allow you to search better for them
- “Alright Joe, we’re ready to get that crown scheduled, now - is there a day or time that typically works best for you during the week?”
- “Alright Joe, let’s get your deep cleaning on the books, is there a day or a time that typically works best for your schedule?”
- Offer about 2 options, give them “choices” but doesn’t overwhelm their brains
- “Ok, Joe, Thursdays’ are best for you? I have next Thursday at 8:15am or the following week on the 20th at 2pm. Which would you like?”
- When a patient is pushed out a few weeks to accommodate correctly in YOUR schedule, offer them the ASAP list
- “We’ve got you all set for 3 wks from now, Joe, on Thursday the 30th at 2pm. I know it’s a few weeks out so what I’ll do is put you on our list for Christina to call you if something comes up sooner on a Thursday, does that work for you?”
- This takes out the guilt that you may feel for not being able to quickly accommodate the patient, allows you to schedule according to your offices’ best format and also gives the front office a list of people to call when there is a short notice cancellation.

# Sample Organizational Chart

# Sample:

# Tips:

1. As CEO you should strive to have the smallest number of people reporting directly to you as possible.
2. No more than one person should fill a role, but a person can fill more than one role.
3. A person can have more than one direct supervisor from different departments.

# Software to Illustrate:

LucidChart is a great tool to help diagram out an organizational Chart, or Google Slides/Microsoft Powerpoint.

# Mango Phones + Computers

- In our office, the internet goes from the wall, through the phone, then to the computer.
- By this fact, if the computer or phone’s internet is not working, then look at the wires leading from the wall to the phone, then from phone to the computer.
- FLEX- is then the program that reads the data coming to the phone, and sometimes pops-up with the information about the caller.

# Switchboard Tutorial

In our Example Dental Switchboard there are different options for when we are open/closed or on holiday

- If we are open, the switchboard transfers the calls to all of the in office extensions
---
● If the call is not picked up by any of the 8 lines after 20 seconds it will send a missed call notification text to the cell numbers we have designated.

● After the text message is sent it will send the call to voicemail

- ○ If we are closed, the auto attendant sound clip will play

● The pt will then be prompted to press one or stay on the line to leave a voicemail

● If the pt presses any number besides 2 (emergency line) or does nothing, they will be redirected to the regular voicemail

● The press 2 prompt will direct them to the Emergency Line (Dr. XXXX s cell at this time)

● If the call goes unanswered after 20 seconds they will be directed to the emergency line voicemail

- ○ If it is a holiday, calls are routed to the emergency voicemail.

# Creating Sound Clips:

● Select “Sound Clips” in left navigation bar

● Dial *99 to record a new sound clip/ follow verbal instructions given

● Reload the sound clips page, the newly recorded clip will appear

● Click into the clip, rename and update

● Use for automated greeting for any call, Auto Attendant features (see below under “Switchboards”), or any where you want a voice clip

- ○ We have sound clips for:

- ● Auto Attendant in the Example Dental Switchboard (used when closed to direct patients to the voicemail or emergency line)
- ● Emergency Voicemail (directs patient to leave name/number and brief message for on call doctor)
- ● Open Hours Voicemail (directs patient to leave a message for callback)
- ● Can also set up additional *codes (*100 - *109) to re-record over existing sound clips

Link to Soundclip youtube video - How To Add Sound Clips To Your VOIP System With Mango Voice | Man…

# Tabs on Switchboard

- ● Transfer and Continue
- - ○ Allows you to transfer a call for a selected amount of time then send to a different line or ring group if the call is not picked up in that amount of time

● Transfer
- - ○ Allows you to transfer a call to an extension indefinitely until the line or ring group is picked up or sent to voicemail

● Auto Attendant
---
If the call is not answered after a selected amount of time the auto attendant will play the sound clip, allowing the caller to decide who they will be transferred to/leave message depending on the option they choose.

After the auto attendant box is created, choose the sound clip to play, and the # options to press.

Create the transfers for the lines noted in the sound clip, and drag and attach to each option (press 1 or 2) bubble on the auto attendant box.

- If there is a stay on the line option in the sound clip added, create a Transfer and Continue box and attach it to the “On Timeout” bubble on the top right corner.

Enable Auto Extension dialing so the caller can choose their option if they know it without hearing the entire menu.

If the caller presses a # not listed in the sound clip you can create a Transfer and Continue box and attach it to the “On Invalid” bubble on the top left corner - this will take them to whatever line you choose in that Transfer and Continue box.

If the call is not answered from there, you can attach a “Leave Voicemail” box to the final “Transfer and Continue” box you have linked to the auto attendant.

# External Transfer

Allows dialing outside the phone system (Cell phone or different landline out of office location).

- Good for after hours or on call.
- Mark the “Pass Through Caller ID” box so the external number can see who is calling.

# Recall List

# Obtaining Recall List

- Click the List icon on the top right hand corner in open dental
- An “Appointment Lists” pop-up will appear
- Click the top button “Recall”
- To populate an accurate list, be mindful of three things:
- Make SURE the “Include Reminded” box is checked
- Double check your date range
- Under “Clinic” make sure “All” is selected
---
- Click “Refresh List”
- Have an additional Open Dental open so you can check the chart/account for any notes regarding scheduling
- Check balances and comm logs (just in case there are reasons as to why we haven’t scheduled back/also to familiarize yourself with the pt) before calling

# Script 1

- Scheduler- Hello! This is (your name) from Example Dental calling for (pt’s name).
- PT- This is she/he
- Scheduler- I’m very happy I was able to reach you today. Our records show that your last professional cleaning and oral health exam was (date of last cleaning). As you know, your dental insurance covers at least two cleanings and exams each year, but does not carry over that benefit into the next calendar year. In other words, if the benefit is not used you lose it. Most of our patients want to be sure to take advantage of their insurance, and we are happy to help them keep track of what they can use. Our hygienist (Hygienist’s name) has time next Wednesday at 2 pm and Thursday at 9 am, which of these appointments would you prefer?
---
# Script 2

- Hi (pt’s name), this is (your name) over at Example Dental. Our records show that your last professional cleaning and oral health exam was (last cleaning). At that time Dr. (blank) also noted that he wanted to check two teeth on your top left side when you returned. We missed seeing you in (date due), and want to be sure that you are getting the follow-up care you need.
- NOTE- If you have to leave a message, just say you are calling about their next/upcoming appointment (even if no appointment is scheduled). That way they will call you back wondering what you are referring to. Once you have them on the phone, you can talk about rescheduling. If you say you’re calling to schedule an appointment they are more than likely not going to call back.

After calling the patient to schedule, double click on their name and an “Edit Recall” pop-up will appear

- Change the status (appointment scheduled, call back/not ready, pt will call us, left voicemail, etc.)
- Make any notes you feel necessary
- If scheduled, pt will be removed from removed from the recall list automatically

# Protocol for Checking Out and Reappointing

- Verify tx completed (either with the assistant present or route slip, if pt had to wait)
- Breakdown cost for pt again (insurance/discounts/payment plan etc.)
- Obtain payment
- NOW prioritized in the back, Assistants are first line of defense here
- Take payment if not already done in the back
- After payment is obtained, focus on recare
- Is the patient finished with tx?? If not, go over what is to be completed at next visit
- Ideally back office staff will have already set up an appointment for the next visit
- Is the patient scheduled for the next 6mo check up??
- Are family members scheduled for recare??
- If we focus on getting the patients on the books for their next appointment while they are in the office, we eliminate so much leg work we would need to do in the future (phone/text/email tag) {pts are more likely to schedule while standing in front of you, rather than over the phone}

# Scripting:

Back Office Staff: Hi (TC), I have (pt’s name) here and we are all finished with the (tx completed) today. I scheduled her back for priority #2 in the treatment plan (reiterate tx needed to be completed at next visit). If you would be willing to go over cost again on that for (pt’s name) just to verify we are all on the same page, that would be great!!!

Back office to PT: (Pt name) I am going to leave you in (TC name’s) hands. They will go over everything for the appointment we scheduled on (xx/xx/xxxx). Let us know if you need anything between now and then!

Tx Coordinator: Sounds like Dr. (blank) and (assistant) rocked out that (tx completed) for you. Let’s get you squared away for today and then I will double check everything for (next visit). It looks like after insurance and/or discounts, your estimated patient portion is ($). How would you like to take care of that today?? (Pt pays for services completed)

Tx Coordinator: Well, (back office member) is making my job easier by already scheduling you back for (next priority in tx plan). I have a breakdown of your estimated cost here, that I’ve printed out for you to take home. Do you have any questions regarding your next visit here with us??

Pt: No, you have all been very helpful. I hate coming to the dentist, but your team makes it a little easier by explaining everything for me to understand.

Tx Coordinator: I’m glad we could take great care of you! Now that we have you scheduled for that (tx scheduled), and you are on the books for your regular cleaning/checkup {IF NOT SCHEDULE}, you should be all set to go! Thanks for coming in today and let us know if you have any questions/concerns.
---
# Collecting at Check-out

Collecting after care is completed can be tricky at times. There are multiple factors to check and double check when collecting from a patient. Ultimately, we are here to provide excellent service to our patients. That means from the time they arrive until they leave our practice, we should be doing everything we can to provide care that is accurate both clinically and financially.

Ideally, there should be no surprises when collecting from a patient. If protocol is being followed in the steps leading up to this final process, the patient should already know what to expect when they arrive at checkout. Of course, as we all know, we live in a less than ideal world. This cheat sheet should ensure that the checkout process is as smooth as possible for our patients.

# Pts with insurance:

- Verify with the dental assistant, that the saved treatment plan matches the treatment that was completed that day
- Check the most recently saved treatment plan under the “Treatment Plan” tab on the left hand side of open dental (again verify that this matches with tx completed)
- The treatment plan is broken down as follows: (explain each of these to the patient when going over treatment plans)
- First number- FULL Fee (before insurance discounts)
- Second number- The maximum amount insurance will cover (this is not important to the patient, skip this number when going over cost)
- We are only concerned with how much insurance is estimating they WILL pay on the procedure, not the maximum amount they COULD pay
- Third Number- Discount for being in network with the patient's insurance (verify that we are indeed in network with the particular insurance before including this discount)
- Fourth Number- ESTIMATED patient portion
- Be sure to use the verbiage “estimated” -as there is no way to be sure what their insurance will ultimately pay for the completed procedure
- Let the patient know that if for any reason insurance doesn’t pay as anticipated, they would be responsible for paying the full fee (first number in tx plan)
---
❖ IF additional treatment was completed that was not discussed in the previously presented treatment plan, the back office staff (doctor/assistant/hygienist) SHOULD have saved/presented a new treatment plan with the additional services attached

- After checking the presented treatment plan, you are ready to collect for the services completed
- Click the “Account” tab above the “Treatment Plan” tab on the left hand side of Open Dental
- The account tab should show the completed services for that date and all other services completed previously, highlight the services you wish to collect for that day
- Click the “New Claim” button (with the yellow umbrella) above the services completed in open dental
---
- An “Edit Claim” popup will appear with that days completed service attached
- Click okay on the bottom right hand side of the popup to create the claim to their insurance

89
---
The estimated patient portion at the bottom of the claim in red should match what was presented in the earlier treatment plan.

VS.

If the balance at the top of the account screen and tx plan dollar amounts don’t match it could mean one of the following:

# Treatment Discrepancies

Treatment wasn’t completed as presented (services were added or removed prior to completion).

- Verify accuracy of presented treatment plan and compare with completed services.

# Outstanding Claims

A claim from previous procedures hasn’t been closed yet (insurance hasn’t paid for earlier services completed) {ie- rct completed 2 weeks before the crown was prepped may still be waiting for payment from insurance} this will reflect in the total balance in the patients account.

- If a previous claim is still processing, just collect the estimated patient portion for the services completed that day.
- After the insurance pays on all claims, we will have a more accurate idea of what the patient actually owes.

There are a couple of ways to ensure a more accurate treatment plan.
---
# 1. Verrific

There are many different tiers of dental plans within each specific dental insurance. That being said, not every patient that has “Delta Dental” (for example) is going to have the same coverage for each procedure. Ideally, the patient- who signed up/is paying for this plan- should know what their plan covers and doesn’t cover. As we know, that is rarely the case. In order to make sure that the estimate that we give to the patient is correct, use the Verrific service to verify coverage. (Instructions Link)

# a.

The Verrific service takes a couple of days to populate the patient’s explanation of benefits in Open Dental. If scheduling in advance for a patient- make sure to send info to Verrific at least a few days prior to their appointment. That way the patient knows what to expect when they arrive for their treatment.

# 2. Pre-Authorization

We can also send a pre-authorization (Instructions Link) to guarantee insurance payment for a patient’s specific procedure. These are especially helpful for high dollar treatment plans (implants/bridges/partials/dentures) or plans that might be considered cosmetic (anterior crowns). A pre-authorization can take weeks or even months to get approved depending on the insurance. Usually, send in the pre-auth and wait for it to come back from insurance before scheduling the patient due to fluctuating wait time.

# 3. Commlogs

Make SURE to read all the recent financial related commlogs just in case there is a note in there about any discounts the doctor may have offered in the treatment room. The assistant will note any price points the doctor may have mentioned (as they don’t always line up with the actual fee’s).

# Pt’s without insurance:

# 1.

Patient’s that aren’t working with any dental insurance are pretty straightforward. First, mention our membership that we offer in office, and its benefits it has to patients with no insurance (ie 2 cleanings and 20% off services).

# 2.

If the patient is uninterested in the membership, you will collect the full fee for any completed treatment.
---
# Payment Options Menu

1. Pay in Full Day of Service

We will make the most accurate estimate of insurance, and let you know the remaining co-pay for your portion of treatment.
2. Pay Half to Start, Half to Finish

For common dental work sent to the laboratory, we can accept half on the day of preparations & models, and then the second ½ on the date where we deliver or seat the final piece.
3. Payment Plan over 3 Months on a Credit Card

We can take your credit card information- charging ⅓ today, and then ⅓ each over the next 2 months.
4. CareCredit:

Up to 12 Months with 0% Interest

For Example: $1,200 can be paid just $100 / month for 12 months.
5. Up to 5 Years with Finance Partner

In 5 minutes you can be approved for financing to make large procedures more feasible through smaller monthly payments.
- We will work on getting you a “EXAMPLE Dental” direct website that will take your patients directly to this site, www.ubt.com/ubtchoice
- The website should be something like this: www.ubt.com/xxxxx (barring no one already has rights to this site)
- As a follow up on the decision timeframe, the Choice Program is actually an auto-decision based on the patient’s credit history, debt-to-income and employment history. If the patient sticks around, a decision is usually rendered within 5 minutes.
- If your patient declines for some reason (our loan team) will still review the application to make sure there isn’t something outside of the norm or they can also see if the patient may be willing to pledge a vehicle or another piece of collateral.
- If approved, the loan team typically will get loan documents sent out via docusign to the patient's email within 2-3 hours after approval.
- After patient signs via Docusign before 4pm, funding will be electronically deposited into a UBT corporate bank account for EXAMPLE Dental same day. If signed after 4pm, funding will be electronically deposited into a UBT corporate bank account for EXAMPLE Dental on the next business day.
---
At this point, there is no simple email notification of this deposit, but I will work with the team to see if there is a way we can automate this on the Choice Program. The recourse Patient Finance Program does have this so I will see if we can do this. In addition, we can give you & your front office team access to this account on business banking online to login and check to see if payments have come in.

# Here are the current terms under which we provide UBT Choice Loans:

|UBT Choice Dental Loans|8.99% - up to 60 month term – 720+ credit score|
|---|---|
| |9.99-14.99% - up to 60 month term – 719-670 credit score|
|Minimum loan amount|$1,000. Complete application at www.ubt.com/ubtchoice (website with www.ubt.com/l to come in a couple of weeks)|
|Can electronically sign documents|with Docusign|
|Auto pay available| |
|45 days to first payment| |
|Fee|$49|

Next steps, set up a UBT corporate bank account for Choice Program funding. I can work with you on this at your convenience and get this all set-up via DocuSign. If we can visit over the phone to gather the information on tax ID, address, signers, signers driver’s license and social security info, customer due diligence information, etc.. I can have the account opened that day and sent out.

# Insurance Estimates

Before going over cost for treatment with a patient, first double check to see if the patient has dental insurance. This will affect the cost of treatment significantly. This information can be found under the “Family” tab on the left hand side, in open dental.

INSURANCE
VS.
NO INSURANCE
Next-

- See if the insurance has been checked through the Verrific service to ensure accuracy. The percentage breakdown will be a lot more detailed and will often have dates of previously completed SRP/X-rays/etc. typed in RED at the bottom of the breakdown under “Subscriber Note”, it will say Verrific/Date/Time checked.
- If the patient’s insurance has been sent through Verrific, the breakdown in the “treatment plan” tab should be accurate.
---
If the patient’s insurance has not been checked through Verrific the treatment plan breakdown may not be accurate, Open Dental will just populate percentages associated with other patients who have that insurance (Ameritas, Metlife, Delta Dental). It is not plan specific!!!

- Always indicate that the treatment plan is an estimate, but especially in this case as the numbers may vary from plan to plan

95
---
# Membership Discount

- If the patient has signed up for our in house Membership Program, it wills say Membership Discount Plan where their insurance would normally be displayed
- The treatment plan will show a breakdown with the 20% off discount they receive for being a member

# Revenue Cycle Management - Inputting Fee Income

Briefly, fee income can come to EXAMPLE Dental via numerous avenues:

- electronic funds transfer (EFT) into our bank account
- U.S. Postal service
- the Payconnect website
- telephone call to the office
- the patient making a payment at the time of his/her appointment.

This procedure describes how we record the fee income in Open Dental, and in particular, how we record the fee income using the most efficient and accurate method--the uploading function from DentalXChange.

# Avenue 1: EFT

Either the business manager or an owner visits the bank website each day. The website will show information such as this:

Every electronic credit from a fee payor source (i.e. insurance company) is then added to the document called “DAILY ACH”.

The Revenue Cycle Manager will view the DAILY ACH each morning and attempt to find the matching ERA in Open Dental > Manage > ERAs. In this diagram, the $519.18 credit in the bank from DDIL needs its ERA, so it can be posted into Open Dental.
---
In Open Dental &gt; Manage &gt; ERAs, be sure to click “Refresh” when you open the window, and after you post each ERA.

“Refresh” brings in new ERAs into the screen and eliminates those that you have processed. Note the Code column: Some ERAs may be for paper checks that arrive at the office, and some are marked “NON” for non-payment claims or denials.

# TO UPLOAD AN ERA INTO OPEN DENTAL:

Double-click on the ERA that has been either received electronically or deposited by check.

Double-click on each patient’s line to bring up the encounter that is included in the ERA.

Look over the payment figures: the amounts for EOB totals should match the Totals amounts.

****get answers here for when numbers look weird****

105
---
When all looks correct, click “Finalize Payment”, and OK (is this the process??) If there are additional patients listed on the ERA, double-click on each one until the entire ERA is processed. Return to Open Dental’s ERA screen and click “Refresh” again.

# Avenue 2: Paper EOB

Some insurance carriers send a paper check with a paper EOB. Remember, however, that an ERA may also be sent to DentalXChange, and that ERA is what can be uploaded in an efficient and accurate manner. When the daily mail delivery is given to the Revenue Cycle Manager, all checks are immediately endorsed and put in the bank bag. The paper EOB is retained and we wait for an ERA to arrive. If one does not arrive in a few days or so, go ahead and use the paper EOB to record the fee income in Open Dental using this alternate method:

# TO RECEIVE AN EOB INTO OPEN DENTAL:

In Open Dental > Select Patient. Locate and select each patient on the paper EOB, one at a time. Go to the patient’s Account. Locate the date of service shown on the EOB. (usually in red print) Double-click on that date of service and immediately click “By Procedure”.

****enter more directions here****

# Avenue 3: Some patients go online with Payconnect

(our credit card processor) using a link on their patient statement. Each morning, the Revenue Cycle Manager should check the dashboard to see if there are any New Account Messages. If there is one or more account messages, click on the box to see the payment details.
---
# Record the patient payment in Open Dental.

Avenue 4: The patient phones in a credit card payment. This patient payment should be recorded in Open Dental during the phone call.

# COVID-19 Documents

Even though vaccinations are increasing and the threat of COVID-19 declining, there is still risk to staff and all necessary precautions need to be in place. The following documents were created to help explain all precautions and instruct team on how to treat all the complex questions that arise around COVID-19.

Included are the following:

1. COVID Business Operations Plan
2. COVID Precautions

# COVID-19 Business Operations Plan

An interactive operations plan with you in mind

May 3, 2020

The contents contained herein are subject to change based upon Federal, State and local regulations, guidance from agencies and additional knowledge to be obtained through the Pandemic Operations.

# Re-opening Offices and Identifying Authoritative Sources

1. Nebraska practices will follow the guidance of State Dental Board and Nebraska Dental Association as the authoritative sources on resuming non-emergent care. Thus says the NDA and State Dental Board:

“DHHS released the DHMs for each county that will take effect May 4th. The DHMs for your county are listed on the DHHS website.

As they effect dental offices, there are no prohibitions for dental offices opening up on May 4th. There remains confusion regarding whether the CDC and OSHA would prevent dental offices in Nebraska from opening May 4th should they choose to do so.

The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event. As a result, the CDC is providing “guidance” for Covid-19, which is a “recommendation” and NOT a guideline. The CDC guidelines for oral health safe care may be found here.
---
Please note that the CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Guidance for Dental Settings During the COVID-19 Response states: “DHCP should regularly consult their state dental boards or other regulating agencies for requirements specific to their jurisdictions.”

Nebraska controls what procedures are allowed to be provided, largely through our Board of Dentistry. The Nebraska Board of Dentistry and State Dental Director have both approved the NDA Office Opening Protocols, which refer to the CDC for PPE and infection control recommendations but not what procedures can be provided.

The difference between “guidelines” and “guidance” was verified with CDC personnel, who stated, “Guidance is advice and guidelines are rules that should be followed. The ultimate authority lies with each individual state.”

Likewise, OSHA issued guidance for dental offices operating in COVID-19. “Dentistry employers should remain alert of changing outbreak conditions, including as they relate to community spread of the virus and testing availability, and implement infection prevention measures accordingly. As states or regions satisfy the gating criteria to progress through the phases of the guidelines for Opening up America Again, employers will likely be able to adapt this guidance to better suit evolving risk levels and necessary control measures in their workplaces.

The NDA Board recommends that individual practitioners pay special attention to mask versus respirator requirements based on aerosol producing procedures. These references may be found on the NDA’s COVID-19 page and Dental Office Opening Protocols.

Each individual practitioner may determine the best time for them to return to practice which may be after the May 4th date.

# Scheduling Principles

1. Scheduling practices will minimize the number of the patients in the office
1. Each appointment will be scheduled for 20 minutes longer than would be originally anticipated.
2. If possible, or if questionable, patients will be scheduled a virtual consultation to minimize the COVID-19 exposure risk.
3. To minimize patient volume and COVID-19 exposure, routine post-operative appointments a telephone follow-up may be substituted where possible.
4. Appointment blocks will be adjusted to allow for COVID-19 screening, increased PPE donning/doffing, and proper infection control practices.
5. We will work to accommodate Emergency Patients, but this will not be at the expense of proper screening and infection control protocols.

# COVID-19 Officer

1. Each site will designate a COVID-19 Officer
1. “Example” will be the COVID-19 Officer.
2. Duties include the following:
---

# COVID-19 PANDEMIC EMERGENCY DENTAL TREATMENT

# NOTICE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISK FORM

Our goal is to provide a safe environment for our patients and staff, and to advance the safety of our local community. This document provides information we ask you to acknowledge and understand regarding COVID-19.

COVID-19 is a serious and highly contagious disease. The World Health Organization has classified it as a pandemic. You could contract COVID-19 from a variety of sources. Our practice wants to ensure you are aware of the additional risks of contracting COVID-19 associated with dental care.

COVID-19 has a long incubation period. You or your healthcare providers may have the virus and not show symptoms and yet still be highly contagious. Determining who is infected by COVID-19 is challenging and complicated due to limited availability for virus testing.

Due to the frequency and timing of visits by other dental patients, the characteristics of the virus, and the characteristics of dental procedures, there is an elevated risk of you contracting the virus simply by being in a dental office.

Dental procedures create water spray which is one way the disease is spread. The ultra-fine nature of the water spray can linger in the air for a long time, allowing for transmission of the COVID-19 virus to those nearby.

You cannot wear a protective mask over your mouth to prevent infection during treatment as your health care providers need access to your mouth to render care. This leaves you vulnerable to COVID-19 transmission while receiving dental treatment.

Pursuant to statements from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Dental Association (ADA), non-essential or elective treatment, based on the assessment of our staff, will be rescheduled. According to the ADA, dental emergencies are “potentially life threatening and require immediate treatment to stop ongoing tissue bleeding [or to] alleviate severe pain or infection”. The ADA also recommends that urgent dental care which “focuses on the management of conditions that require immediate attention to relieve severe pain and/or risk of infection and to alleviate the burden on hospital emergency departments" be provided in as minimally invasive a manner as possible.

I confirm that I have read this notice and understand and accept that there is an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 in a dental office or with dental treatment. I further confirm I am seeking treatment for a condition that meets the emergent or urgent criteria noted above. I understand and accept the additional risk of contracting COVID-19 from contact at this office. I also acknowledge that I could contract COVID-19 from outside this office and unrelated to my visit here.

I have read and understand the information stated above:

# Purpose

To comply with the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and to assist team members affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with job-protected leave and pay, where applicable. This policy will be in effect from April 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020. Our existing FMLA leave policy still applies to all other FMLA-qualifying reasons for leave outside of this policy.

# Expanded FMLA Leave

# Team Member Eligibility

All current team members who have been employed with EXAMPLE Dental for at least 30 days and are actively scheduled for work are eligible for leave under this policy.

# Reason for Leave

Eligible team members who are unable to work (or telework) due to a need to care for their child when a school or place of care has been closed, or when the regular childcare provider is unavailable due to a public health emergency with respect to COVID-19.

"Child" means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is:

- Under 18 years of age.
- 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.

"Childcare provider" means a provider who receives compensation for providing childcare services on a regular basis, including:

- A center-based childcare provider.
- A group home childcare provider.
- A family childcare provider (one individual who provides childcare services for fewer than 24 hours per day, as the sole caregiver, and in a private residence).
- Other licensed provider of childcare services for compensation.
- A childcare provider that is 18 years of age or older who provides childcare services to children who are either the grandchild, great grandchild, sibling (if such provider lives in a separate residence), niece or nephew of such provider, at the direction of the parent.

"School" means an elementary or secondary school.

# Duration of Leave

Team members will have up to 12 weeks of leave to use from April 1, 2020, through December 31, 2020, for the purposes stated above. This time is included in and not in addition to the total FMLA leave entitlement of 12 weeks in a 12-month period.

For example, if a team member has already taken 6 weeks of FMLA leave, that team member would be eligible for another 6 weeks of FMLA leave under this policy.

# Increments & Intermittent Use of Leave

Team members may take expanded FMLA leave intermittently and in any increment agreed to with their manager. For example, a team member may only need 4 hours per day of leave to care for his or her child or may only need to do so on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Managers and team members are expected to be flexible in scheduling wherever possible.

# Pay During Leave

Leave will be unpaid for the first 10 days of leave; however, team members may use accrued paid vacation, sick or personal leave during this time. The team member may also elect to use the paid leave.
---
provided under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act, as further explained below. After the first 10 days, leave will be paid at two-thirds of a team member's regular rate of pay for the number of hours the team member would otherwise be scheduled to work. Pay will not exceed $200 per day and $10,000 in total, or $12,000 in total if using emergency paid sick leave for the first two weeks. Any unused portion of this pay will not carry over to the next year.

# For team members with varying hours, one of two methods for computing the number of hours paid will be used:

- If the team member has worked 6 months or more, the average number of hours that the team member was scheduled per day over the 6-month period ending on the date on which the team member takes leave, including hours for which the team member took leave of any type.
- If the team member has worked less than 6 months, the expected number of hours to be scheduled per day at the time of hire.

# Team member Status and Benefits During Leave

While a team member is on leave, the company will continue the team member's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the team member had continued to work. While on paid leave, the employer will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the team member's share of the premium. During any unpaid portions of leave, the team member must continue to make this payment per instructions from the HR department.

If the team member contributes to a life insurance or disability plan, the employer will continue making payroll deductions while the team member is on paid leave. During any portion of unpaid leave, the team member may request continuation of such benefits and pay his or her portion of the premiums, or the employer may elect to maintain such benefits during the leave and pay the team member's share of the premium payments. If the team member does not continue these payments, the employer may discontinue coverage during the leave. If the employer maintains coverage, the employer may recover the costs incurred for paying the team member's share of any premiums, whether or not the team member returns to work.

# Procedure for Requesting Leave

All team members requesting FMLA leave must provide written notice of the need for leave to the HR department using posted leave request forms from the Intranet or obtaining through their manager. Notice of the need for leave must include:

- The name and age of the child or children being care for.
- The name of the school, place of care, or childcare provider that closed or became unavailable due to COVID-19 reasons.
- A statement representing that no other suitable person is available to care for the child or children during the period of requested leave. For children over the age of 14, a statement indicating the special circumstances that require the team member to provide care during daylight hours.

On a basis that does not discriminate against team members on FMLA leave, the company may require a team member on FMLA leave to report periodically on the team member's status and intent to return to work.

# Team member Status After Leave

Generally, a team member who takes FMLA leave will be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. The company may choose to exempt certain key team members from this requirement and not return them to the same or similar position when doing so will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to business operations.
---
# Emergency Paid Sick Leave

# Eligibility

All current full- and part-time team members currently scheduled but unable to work (or telework) due to one of the following reasons for leave:

- The team member is subject to a federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID–19.
- The team member has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID–19.
- The team member is experiencing symptoms of COVID–19 and seeking a medical diagnosis.
- The team member is caring for an individual who is subject to either number 1 or 2 above.
- The team member is caring for his or her child if the school or place of care of the child has been closed, or the childcare provider of such child is unavailable, due to COVID–19 precautions.
- The team member is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the secretary of health and human services in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of labor.

"Child" means a biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is:

- Under 18 years of age.
- 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability.

"Individual" means an immediate family member, roommate, or similar person with whom the team member has a relationship that creates an expectation that the team member would care for the person if he or she self-quarantined or was quarantined. Additionally, the individual being cared for must: a) be subject to a federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order as described above; or b) have been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine based on a belief that he or she has COVID-19, may have COVID-19 or is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.

# Rate of Pay

Emergency sick leave will be paid at the team member's regular rate of pay, or minimum wage, whichever is greater, for leave taken for reasons 1-3 above. Team members taking leave for reasons 4-6 will be compensated at two-thirds their regular rate of pay, or minimum wage, whichever is greater. Pay will not exceed:

- $511 per day and $5,110 in total for leave taken for reasons 1-3 above.
- $200 per day and $2,000 in total for leave taken for reasons 4-6 above.

# Interaction with Other Paid Leave

The team member may use emergency paid sick leave under this policy before using any other accrued paid time off for the qualifying reasons stated above.

Team members on expanded FMLA leave under this policy may use emergency paid sick leave concurrently with that leave. Emergency paid sick leave may also be used when a team member is on leave under traditional FMLA for his or her own COVID-19-related serious health condition or to care for a qualified family member with such a condition.

# Procedure for Requesting Emergency Paid Sick Leave

Team members must notify their manager or the HR manager of the need and specific reason for leave under this policy. A form will be provided to all team members on the intranet and/or in a manner accessible to all. Verbal notification will be accepted until practicable to provide written notice.
---
# Documentation supporting the need for leave

Documentation supporting the need for leave must be included with the leave request form, such as:

- A copy of the federal, state, or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 applicable to the team member or the name of the government entity that issued the order.
- Written documentation by a health care provider advising the team member to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 or the name of the provider who advised the team member.
- The name and relation of the individual the team member is taking leave to care for who is subject to a quarantine or isolation order or is advised to self-quarantine.
- The name and age of the child or children being cared for; the name of the school, place of care, or childcare provider that closed or became unavailable; and a statement that no other suitable person is available to care for the child during the period of requested leave.
- For children over age 14, a statement indicating the special circumstances that require the team member to provide care during daylight hours.

Once emergency paid sick leave has begun, the team member and his or her manager must determine reasonable procedures for the team member to report periodically on the team member's status and intent to continue to receive paid sick time.

# Job Protections

No team member who appropriately utilizes emergency paid sick leave under this policy will be discharged, disciplined, or discriminated against for work time missed due to this leave.

Please contact the HR department with any questions.

# Covid Precautions

At EXAMPLE Dental we take your health, and our own health, very seriously. We are going to go to great lengths to make sure that the team has a safe work environment, and that we are not contributing to the spread of the virus in the community.

We need to

1. Keep infected patients/staff (or even asymptomatic/iCOVID-positive) out of the office and
2. Keep ourselves protected from any virus that may unknowingly be in the office.

# Health Measures to take:

- Staff: Temperature taken everyday
- Make sure staff is healthy- record temperatures each day in a spreadsheet
- Patient:
- Pre-calling/Pre-text
- Change text and calling script to ask whether they have:
1. Have you traveled to anywhere outside the state of Nebraska in the last 14 days?
2. Have you had contact with anyone with confirmed COVID-19 in the last 14 days?
3. Have you had any of these symptoms in the last 14 days?
- Fever greater than 100
- Difficulty breathing
- Cough
4. Are you currently experiencing fever over 100, difficulty breathing or cough?
- Text to seat service
- This will reduce people in the waiting room
- Temperature taken at the door, questionnaire at the door
- Repeat screening questions
- Once seated:
- Swish with Hydrogen Peroxide and Listerine mixture
- Reduce viral load in the mouth
- Ozonated Water -
- Disinfect all water lines/water when used in ultrasonics
- Some studies suggest that any aerosol is then disinfected- no good studies show this however

# Keeping team members protected

- Masks
- N95s provided
- Must be covered with cheaper mask or cloth mask
- One N95 per day….sterilized each lunch time in ozone box and/or UV light sterilization box
- Rubber versions of N95 provided with N95 Filters
---
# Infection Control Measures

# Sanitation Procedures

- Can be sanitized between patients if needed
- Change filters as needed

# Gowns & Clothing

- We will wear scrubs- however, change into other clothes prior to leaving
- Shoes- have a pair of shoes for office-work only
- We will purchase Crocs for all staff to be at the office
- Gown- ADA recommends using professional judgement when deciding whether to use a gown- and CDC recommendations are that we wear a gown for all aerosol generating procedures until they appear ‘soiled’
- Use best judgement on replacement of gowns

# Localized Air Filtration at Source of Aerosols

- We have 5 top-of-the-line units that will remove almost all aerosols if placed accurately.
- 12 inches above the mouth, and 12 inches lateral
- (Sentry Air filters to .12 microns- ULPA Filter) (Covid is .125 Microns)
- All units Delivered 4/25 - 400 Cubic Feet per minute suction

# Ozone Gas

Each evening for 2 hours- last person to leave turns on the machine to a 120 minute timer

- Disinfect all surfaces and air

# Protecting Patients from Each Other

# Scheduling

- More time given for each procedure so that less patients are in the office at any given time.
- Try to decrease patient to patient interaction as much as possible

# Appointment Duration

- Hygiene appointments are now 80 minutes
- New patients are 2 hrs

# Waiting Room Protocol

- No patients sit in waiting room
- Patients are walked up front and no patient should almost every come in contact with another patient
- No Patient guest in operatory except in case of a minor

# In Case of Infection Report

In case someone does come back in the next few weeks and says, “Hey, I was infected and possibly contagious when I came into your office.” At this point, this is the reason we will:

- Sign-in Sheet used at Front door (FOR NON-PATIENTS only)
- Make sure there is an accurate record of anyone not on the schedule, who was also in the building

# Other Ideas

- PPE Fee- potentially Delta Dental will pay
- Ameritas- write a statement on claim for cleaning saying that COVID made us do it.
---
# Checklists to complete for Operational Systemization:

- ☐ We have created protocol sheets for every ‘Chunk’ of tasks performed by each team member (with the assistance of each team member)

# Chapter 4

# Human Resources

Recently we have seen more and more dentists around the country worry about a lack of good applicants, and a lack of applicants overall, for their open positions. If you’ve had turnover of team members in your dental office, you know how important these people can be to your operations. Finding and creating these great team members is imperative in this competitive and limited market. These ‘A-players’ can increase the game of the entire office and make it run smoothly with no headaches. Likewise, a ‘C’ or ‘D-player’ can negatively impact the team and cause stress within the team due to not having clear expectations and not holding people accountable.

Watch the video introduction to this section on Human Resources, Hiring and Onboarding →

These documents shared in this section are examples of documents to help set clear expectations from the very beginning, helping to hire correctly. Then as you On-Board this person, we have handbooks for each position that clearly outline their 30, 60, and 90 Day goals. Included in each position handbook is their daily task lists to help them have a detailed list of their jobs-to-be-done. Unfortunately sometimes an individual isn’t right for the team, and you have to let them go. In those cases, use the termination checklist to make sure everything is done correctly.

As you begin your interview process for any position, make sure you are prepared. A few key items prior to starting the search for a new position is:

1. Is this position needed?
1. Can it be covered by a mix of other personnel? Can it be outsourced easier or cheaper for the time being possibly?
2. What is the exact job description?
---
a. Look through the associated documents in this book to see examples of job descriptions, but sometimes the right job description can help attract better applicants, or people who are looking to switch positions within a dental office.

# 3. What is the pay range for this job?

a. Dr. Jason Tanoory of Finger Lakes Dental care recommends using www.PayScale.com to search for the monetary base pay for positions. When addressing the common question of raises and compensation, he says:

Any position/person gets a thorough summary of their compensation from the previous year provided to them before the 2nd Q review so they know exactly what they make . . . benefits, perks and everything in between.

The team knows that we want them to be the highest paid in the area BUT we will not overpay.

The team knows they can use payscale.com to determine their monetary worth. We encourage them to come "armed and educated" to the review so if they do deserve a raise we will gladly give them one, ultimately putting the wheels in motion to make them one of the highest paid at their position in the area.

# 4. When looking at pay ranges, it is important to give a wide range, because the pay might need to be adjusted for:

1. Inflation (very fast growing currently)
2. Education level of applicant
3. Experience of Applicant
4. Other skills that affect the pay rate of applicants.

a. Are there any internal candidates who would want to switch over to this open job position?

If you have gone through this list, then it helps to start to develop all the following documents. Here is a list with some explanations of how they can best be used and implemented.

# 5. Phone Interview Questions / Help Sheet

a. We recommend having a quick phone interview with all candidates before they would qualify for an in-person interview. This is to check their persona, energy, and interest in the position before spending any more time. Usually during this phone interview we recommend at least being very clear on two major points of the position:

1. Pay Range: “The pay range for this position is $18-22 per hour with benefits, is this in the range that you’re looking for?”
2. Schedule: “This job is 8am-5pm Monday through Thursday with Friday’s being 8am-1pm, is this ok with you?”

iii. Ms. Ashlee Hirschfeld, Founder of ‘GSD Queen’- a service that hires and trains a Personal Assistant for Doctors, says that, “Usually the call should last 5 to 10 minutes, anything longer than that and it is probably too long.” During this call, you will get a quick sense of whether the applicant is acceptable for an in-person interview, so be prepared to have a few times available to meet with them in-person.

# 6. In-Person Interview Help Sheet

a. Sometimes we get into interviews and forget some of the questions to ask an applicant, or we might verge on questions that are illegal to ask. (Some illegal questions include
---
# 7. Employee Handbook

a. Having a complete employee handbook is a necessity in today’s world. This handbook is not merely a stuffy book that sits in a cabinet, however it’s a manual for how employment works in your company. This includes how employees get paid, what they wear, how to request days off, and all other things.

b. Each state is very different in terms of labor laws, and so we do not recommend merely copying someone else’s handbook because it might actually be against your state legislation. If you are looking for a high-level expert on HR law and want to seek someone who can help you formulate your handbook, we recommend Paul Edwards of CEDR, a firm that has been extremely helpful for many DSN members across the country.

# 8. Associate Dentist Handbook

a. The most important position in a dental office to on-board correctly is the dentist. So much of the success of the office is dependent on the dentist being both a leader and a clinician. Setting expectations from the first day is a huge priority. Using a document like this is extremely important to explain all the things, big and small, that make up a good team player.

b. In any handbook, there is always a section that lists other documents that should also be given to the employee when starting.

# 9. Dentist QA

a. If you ever hire associate dentists, it is important to make sure that you set expectations that you will grade their clinical work. Use this document from Dr. Summer Kassmel to help grade their work and clinical acceptability.

# 10. Hygiene Exam QA

a. Similarly with hygiene exams, it is imperative to grade and check in with hygienists regularly to make sure they are all doing things the same way and building trust in a way that leads to a good patient experience. Use this sheet from Dr. Kassmel to work with your hygiene team.

# 11. Leadership Assessment

a. Self reflection is difficult. Use this sheet formed by Dr. Mark Costes and the Dental Success Institute team to grade your own leadership abilities and shortcomings. In each area, give yourself a 1 to 5, 1 being low and 5 being perfect. If you do this with regular cadence, you will find that you can improve the entire culture of your organization by working on improving your own leadership skills.

# 12. Accountability Agreement: Dentist

a. In the Dental Success Institute, we teach that each position should have 100% clarity on the expectations of their position. We recommend having a 1-page form that explains the core values of the practice, their expectations, and the important documents that listed all those expectations.
---
# 13. Hygienist Handbook

a. Another amazing document created to have a smooth on-boarding experience by Dr. Summer Kassmel at Castle Peak Dental. This document includes the job description for the hygiene position, all checklists to know and be proficient in, any KPIs they should work towards, their training cadence, their monthly departmental assessment form, and finally, their accountability agreement.

b. On the first page of the document it also lists all the other documents they should know or receive, including the Employee Handbook, the Clinical Calibration Book, and a Tech Systems Explainer document.

# 14. Hygiene Appointment Checklist

a. Each hygiene appointment should be systemized and done the same way by all the hygienists in your office. This checklist is important to use so that nothing ever gets forgotten in the daily rush.

# 15. Assistant Job Ad

a. In this tight job market, make sure you have ads that work to get people’s attention. The job ad should usually start with something that gets attention like “WONDERFUL OFFICE” or “LOVE WHERE YOU WORK”. Make sure to focus on culture a lot in the process to make sure you don’t hire someone that doesn’t match your culture.

# 16. Assistant Onboarding Email

a. Each position in the office will have an email drafted so that when you hire for this position, you can just send the stock email to the new employee. This email highlights a few things they will be receiving soon, as well as anything to help them get their employment started with you well. It includes:

- i. Reminders for official I-9 paperwork
- ii. Universal On Boarding Document Link
- iii. Reminder of Core Values
- iv. Job Description Link
- v. Software Video Links
- vi. Link to Clinical Calibration Manual
- vii. Contact numbers for Office Manager or Doctors

# 17. Assistant Handbook

a. Here is another example of a positional handbook for assistants. It includes all the needed information like job description, checklists, assessment form, and accountability agreement.

# 18. Assistant Weekly Checklists

a. In many of our offices, we do not hire separate outside cleaning crews. We rely upon our staff during down-time to help clean the office. In addition, there are other things that are needed weekly that aren’t on any daily task-list sheets. These items all get put onto a separate weekly checklist that is given in this example.

# 19. Daily Task Lists for Front Office

a. These three documents are examples of things that should be given to each front desk team member. These checklists include daily items for morning, down-time, and evening.
---
# 20. Employee Engagement Survey Questions

We want to thank Dr. Jason Tanoory and the Finger Lakes Dental Care Team for using and sharing this survey they created. Using this survey every 6 months gives you a good idea about the culture and mood of everyone in the practice. To best use this, sign up for a service like SurveyMonkey or Google Forms. Enter these questions in and give this survey in an anonymous fashion. Each question has the Agree to Disagree scale, but also leaves room for statements as well.

# 21. Total Compensation Worksheet

This worksheet has been a very good tool in helping to level-set expectations about raises. The information on this sheet summarizes all the compensation and places that it comes from. Once an employee gets a firm understanding of how much they are paid, they might be more apt to stay with you rather than jumping to another practice for ‘more pay’, when it might actually not be more.

# 22. Employee ‘Favorite Things’ Questions

Sometimes we want to show appreciation to the team for a job well done. That can be random, or focused around a holiday. Using this sheet is a great way to have a record of some of the things that an employee enjoys, so that you know what to get them when the time comes.

# 23. Termination Checklist

Unfortunately not all employees work out for various reasons. Whatever the reason, it is a good idea to have a uniform way of terminating a person so that it is done in a legal manner and so that you do not miss anything important.

Prior to termination, make sure you print off this list and get ready to terminate. Make sure you have a firm handle on their last paycheck, as well as any softwares they have access to. Once they are terminated they will be removed from all those services and then you can be assured that nothing will happen to patient data.

# “AT-WILL” EMPLOYMENT

You are free to terminate your employment with the practice at any time, with or without a reason, and the employer has the right to terminate your employment at any time, with or without reason. Therefore, employment with the practice is not for a specified term and can be terminated “at-will” by either party.

However, the “at-will” employment policy can be changed only by written notification signed by the employer. To be binding, the specific terms or benefits of any employment must be in writing and signed by the owner.

# EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

# EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

Example Dental is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived race, creed, color, religion, alienage or national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, disability or handicap, sex, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, genetic information, arrest record, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws. Our management team is dedicated to this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities and general treatment during employment.
---
# Accommodations for Individuals with Disabilities

Example Dental will make reasonable accommodations, as required by law, for the known physical or mental disabilities of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship upon Example Dental's business operations. An accommodation is not reasonable if, even with the accommodation, the employee is unable to perform essential job duties in a manner that would not endanger the employee's health or safety of the employee or others.

Any applicant or employee who believes they require an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of the job should contact the owner to request such an accommodation. Employees should specify what accommodation they need to perform the job and submit supporting medical documentation explaining the underlying physical or mental disability and the basis for the requested accommodation. We then will review and analyze the request, including engaging in an interactive process with the employee or applicant, to identify if such an accommodation can be made. We will evaluate requested accommodations, and as appropriate identify other possible accommodations, if any. The employee will be notified of our decision regarding the request within a reasonable period of time. We will treat all medical information submitted as part of the accommodation process in a confidential manner.

Example Dental will endeavor to accommodate the sincere religious beliefs of its employees to the extent such accommodation does not pose an undue hardship on Example Dental's operations. If employees wish to request such an accommodation, they should contact the Owner.

Any employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the practice owner. Example Dental will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who raise issues of equal employment opportunity. If employees feel they have been subjected to any such retaliation, they should contact the practice owner.

To ensure our workplace is free of artificial barriers, violation of this policy, including any improper retaliatory conduct, will lead to discipline, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations.

# UNIFORMS

If you are required to wear a uniform, we will provide a uniform allowance. You are responsible for laundering and maintaining your wash-and-wear uniforms. We will maintain or pay for the maintenance of PPE uniforms if they require ironing, dry cleaning, or separate laundering because of heavy soil or color. You may be required to return uniforms upon severance of employment. We will launder all uniform items that fall in the category of “personal protective equipment” as required by OSHA.

# EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE REVIEW

The evaluation of an employee’s job performance is an ongoing process, and may occur at varying intervals, most likely monthly.

The performance review serves as a guide to evaluate progress, address areas for improvement, as well as plan further training and establish and commit to future goals. The frequency of evaluations may vary depending upon the length of service, job position, past performance, changes in job duties, or recurring performance problems. After the review, you may be required to sign a performance evaluation report.
---
simply to acknowledge that the items have been discussed with you and that you are aware of its contents.

A salary review is usually given separately and on a different date than the performance review. You may be required to attend specific educational and training sessions to improve your skills or performance.

# POLICIES

# ACCEPTING ENTERTAINMENT, GIFTS, FAVORS, AND GRATUITIES

No employee shall solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, reward, or any other item of monetary value that might influence or appear to influence the judgment or conduct of the employee in the performance of his/her job. Employees can accept gifts or entertainment only in cases where the gifts or entertainment are of nominal value, are customary in the industry, will not violate any laws, and will not influence or appear to influence the employee’s judgment or conduct at his/her employer’s business.

# APPEARANCE

Employees are to look and appear professional at all times. That includes wearing neat, clean, and tasteful clothing. The following are considered to be unacceptable (not a complete list): t-shirts, jogging suits, sportswear, shorts, very short skirts or dresses, jumpsuits, sheer clothing, garments that are unnecessarily revealing, slippers, sandals, tennis shoes, casual loafers or work boots, immoderate or ungroomed hairstyles, rings, ornaments, tattoos, and ornamental piercing(s).

Close contact with patients necessitates meticulous attention to personal and oral hygiene. For example, the smell of cigarette smoke or the eating of malodorous foods such as garlic and onions, may offend patients and coworkers and is not allowed.

Any request for a deviation in the Appearance or Uniform Policy must be submitted in writing. However, such requests are not likely to be approved if they cause any potential undue hardship to the business, or do not meet the Safety or Uniform Policy requirements of the practice, or might infringe on other employees’ rights.

Standard uniform for all clinical positions includes clean, non-wrinkled scrubs approved by the practice, as well as closed-toe shoes. Tattoos should be covered as much as possible.

# Women

- Light jewelry is permitted. Unusual, large, or unprofessional jewelry is not.
- It is preferred that hair be worn short or shoulder-length.
- If hair is longer, it is to be tied back in a neat manner so as not to interfere with the performance of duties.
- Nails are to be manicured and their length should not interfere with the execution of duties.
- Make-up and perfume are to be kept to a minimum.

# Men

● Hair is to be clean, well trimmed, and well groomed

# ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY

Absenteeism—To ensure that our patients receive the proper treatment; we must have adequate staff to handle the workload. Therefore, any unapproved absences from work regardless of the reasons are unacceptable and constitute an unsatisfactory work record. New employees who miss more than three days of work within the orientation and training period will be subject to disciplinary action which could include termination. Exceptions to this attendance policy would be the serious medical conditions that are covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Other exceptions covered by federal and state regulations may also apply.

Failure to notify the employer properly of any absence may result in loss of compensation and may be grounds for disciplinary action (see Job Abandonment). Please call every day during an absence unless otherwise agreed upon. If you are absent for three consecutive working days due to a personal illness or disability, you may be required to provide documentation from your certified healthcare practitioner stating your ability to return to work. Absences longer than one week are converted to a leave of absence.

Tardiness—If you are unable to report to work or find that you will be more than 15 minutes late, please notify the employer as far in advance as possible. In case of an unexpected absence, please notify the employer at least one hour before your shift is scheduled to begin.

# HEALTH AND SAFETY

The health and safety of employees and others on Example Dental property are of critical concern to Example Dental. Example Dental intends to comply with all health and safety laws applicable to our business. To this end, we must rely upon employees to ensure that work areas are kept safe and free of hazardous conditions. Employees are required to be conscientious about workplace safety, including proper operating methods, and recognize dangerous conditions or hazards. Any unsafe conditions or potential hazards should be reported to management immediately, even if the problem appears to be corrected. Any suspicion of a concealed danger present on Example Dental's premises, or in a product, facility, piece of equipment, process or business practice for which Example Dental is responsible should be brought to the attention of management immediately.

Periodically, Example Dental may issue rules and guidelines governing workplace safety and health. Example Dental may also issue rules and guidelines regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. All employees should familiarize themselves with these rules and guidelines, as strict compliance will be expected.

Any workplace injury, accident, or illness must be reported to the employee's supervisor as soon as possible, regardless of the severity of the injury or accident.
---
# NON-HARASSMENT

It is Example Dental's policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional harassment of any individual by another person on the basis of any protected classification including, but not limited to, race, color, national origin, disability, religion, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation or age. The purpose of this policy is not to regulate our employees' personal morality, but to ensure that in the workplace, no one harasses another individual.

If the employee feels that he or she has been subjected to conduct which violates this policy, he or she should immediately report the matter to the office manager. If the employee is unable for any reason to contact this person, or if the employee has not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting any incident of what the employee perceives to be harassment, the employee should contact the owner. Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.

In addition, Example Dental will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report unwelcome conduct to management or who cooperate in the investigation of such reports in accordance with this policy. If the employee feels he or she has been subjected to any such retaliation, he or she should report it in the same manner in which the employee would report a claim of perceived harassment under this policy. Violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations.

# SEXUAL HARASSMENT

It is Example Dental's policy to prohibit harassment of any employee by any supervisor, employee, customer or vendor on the basis of sex or gender. The purpose of this policy is not to regulate personal morality within Example Dental. It is to ensure that all our employees are free from sexual harassment.

While it is not easy to define precisely what types of conduct could constitute sexual harassment, examples of prohibited behavior include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, obscene gestures, displaying sexually graphic magazines, calendars or posters, sending sexually explicit e-mails, text messages and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, such as uninvited touching of a sexual nature or sexually related comments. Depending upon the circumstances, improper conduct also can include sexual joking, vulgar or offensive conversation or jokes, commenting about the employee's physical appearance, conversation about one's own or someone else's sex life, or teasing or other conduct directed toward a person because of their gender which is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an unprofessional and hostile working environment.

If the employees feel they have been subjected to conduct which violates this policy, they should immediately report the matter to the owner. Every report of perceived harassment will be fully investigated and corrective action will be taken where appropriate. All complaints will be kept confidential to the extent possible, but confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.

In addition, Example Dental will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who report unwelcome conduct to management or who cooperate in the investigation of such reports in accordance with this policy. If the employees feel they have been subjected to any such retaliation, they should report it in the same manner in which the employee would report a claim of perceived harassment under this policy.
---
report it in the same manner in which a claim of perceived harassment would be reported under this policy. Violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations.

# ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY

Sexual and other unlawful harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), as amended. Harassment based on a characteristic protected by law, such as race, color, ancestry, national origin, gender, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, religion, age, disability, veteran status, or other characteristic protected by state or federal law, is prohibited.

It is Example Dental’s policy to provide a work environment free of sexual and other harassment. To that end, harassment of our employees by supervisors, coworkers, managers, independent contractors, interns, customers, vendors, or other persons who are in the workplace or at Example Dental events is absolutely prohibited. Further, any retaliation against an individual who has complained about sexual or other harassment or retaliation against individuals for cooperating with an investigation of a harassment complaint is similarly unlawful and will not be tolerated. Example Dental will take all steps necessary to prevent and eliminate unlawful harassment.

# Definition of Unlawful Harassment

“Unlawful harassment” is conduct that has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; has the purpose or effect of substantially and unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance; or otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities because of the individual’s membership in a protected class.

Unlawful harassment includes, but is not limited to, epithets; slurs; jokes; pranks; innuendo; comments; written or graphic material; stereotyping; or other threatening, hostile, or intimidating acts based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, gender, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, age, disability, veteran status, or other characteristic protected by state or federal law.

# Definition of Sexual Harassment

While all forms of harassment are prohibited, special attention should be paid to sexual harassment. “Sexual harassment” is generally defined under both state and federal law as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where:

- Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of any individual’s employment or as a basis for employment decisions; or
- Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

Other sexually oriented conduct, whether intended or not, that is unwelcome and has the effect of creating a work environment that is hostile, offensive, intimidating, or humiliating to workers may also constitute sexual harassment.
---
# Sexual Harassment Policy

While it is not possible to list all those additional circumstances that may constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples of conduct that, if unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment depending on the totality of the circumstances, including the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness:

- Unwanted sexual advances, whether they involve physical touching or not
- Sexual epithets, jokes, written or oral references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding one’s sex life, comments about an individual’s body, comments about an individual’s sexual activity, deficiencies, or prowess
- Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or cartoons
- Unwelcome leering, whistling, brushing up against the body, sexual gestures, or suggestive or insulting comments
- Inquiries into one’s sexual experiences
- Discussion of one’s sexual activities

Sexual harassment does not need to be motivated by sexual desire to be unlawful or to violate this policy. For example, hostile acts toward an employee because of his/her gender can amount to sexual harassment, regardless of whether the treatment is motivated by sexual desire.

All employees should take special note that, as stated above, retaliation against an individual who has complained about sexual harassment and retaliation against individuals for cooperating with an investigation of sexual harassment complaint is unlawful and will not be tolerated at Example Dental.

# COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

Any employee who believes he or she has been subject to or witnessed illegal discrimination, including sexual or other forms of unlawful harassment, is requested and encouraged to make a complaint. You may complain directly to your immediate supervisor, the office manager, the owner, or any other member of management with whom you feel comfortable bringing such a complaint. Similarly, if you observe acts of discrimination toward or harassment of another employee, you are requested and encouraged to report this to one of the individuals listed above.

No reprisal, retaliation, or other adverse action will be taken against an employee for making a complaint or report of discrimination or harassment or for assisting in the investigation of any such complaint or report. Any suspected retaliation or intimidation should be reported immediately to one of the persons identified above.

All complaints will be investigated promptly and, to the extent possible, with regard for confidentiality. If the investigation confirms conduct contrary to this policy has occurred, Example Dental will take immediate, appropriate, corrective action, including discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment.

# PRACTICE PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT

Property or equipment belonging to the practice may not be removed from the premises without written approval. You will be responsible for the proper care and return of all property and equipment assigned to your possession. Desks, lockers, computers or other storage devices, as well as any articles or
---
# REFERENCE REQUESTS

All written, oral, or informal requests for information about employees or former employees are to be referred to the practice owner. Such requests usually involve employment information, personal and business references, descriptions of job duties, etc. No employee may provide (either on or off-the-record) any information regarding current or former employees to any non-employee. By following this policy, we can ensure that the information released about an employee is accurate, authorized, and representative of the practice’s position.

In responding to other employers’ requests for employment information about a former employee without a signed release, the practice will provide only the individual’s start and end date of employment, and title of position(s) held.

In addition, employees and former employees are cautioned to be very careful about what they say about other employees, the employer, and the practice when they are away from the workplace.

# USE OF COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Example Dental's communication and computer systems are intended primarily for business purposes; however limited personal usage is permitted if it does not hinder performance of job duties or violate any other company policy. This includes the voice mail, e-mail and Internet systems. Users have no legitimate expectation of privacy in regard to their use of Example Dental systems.

We may access the voice mail and e-mail systems and obtain the communications within the systems, including past voice mail and e-mail messages, without notice to users of the system, in the ordinary course of business when the company deems it appropriate to do so. The reasons for which the company may obtain such access include, but are not limited to: maintaining the system; preventing or investigating allegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring compliance with software copyright laws; complying with legal and regulatory requests for information; and ensuring that company operations continue appropriately during the employee's absence.

Further, we may review Internet usage to ensure that such use with company property, or communications sent via the Internet using company property, are appropriate. The reasons for which we may review employees' use of the Internet with company property include, but are not limited to: maintaining the system; preventing or investigating allegations of system abuse or misuse; assuring compliance with software copyright laws; complying with legal and regulatory requests for information; and ensuring that company operations continue appropriately during the employee's absence.

The employer may store electronic communications for a period of time after the communication is created. From time to time, copies of communications may be deleted.

Our policies prohibiting harassment, in their entirety, apply to the use of company communication and computer systems. No one may use any communication or computer system in a manner that may be construed by others as harassing or offensive based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, religious beliefs or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law.
---
# Company Policies

# Communication and Computer Systems

Further, since the company's communication and computer systems are intended for business use, all employees, upon request, must inform management of any private access codes or passwords. Unauthorized duplication of copyrighted computer software violates the law and is strictly prohibited. No employee may access, or attempt to obtain access to, another employee's computer systems without appropriate authorization. Violators of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

# Personal Telephone, Cell Phone and Camera Phone Use

Example Dental's cell phone policy offers general guidelines for using personal and company cell phones during work hours. The purpose of this policy is to help us all get the most out of the advantages cell phones offer our company while minimizing distractions, accidents, and frustrations improper cell phone use can cause. This policy applies to all employees.

The following are our basic guidelines for proper employee cell phone use during work hours:

- Cell phones should not be used when they could pose a security or safety risk, or when they distract from work tasks.
- Do not use cell phones for surfing the internet or gaming during work hours.
- Do not use work phones for personal tasks.
- Do not use cell phones while on-the-clock, except during an immediate emergency.
- Do not use cell phones to record confidential information.
- Do not take video or photos without explicit written consent by the patient or guardian when applicable.

Disciplinary Action: Improper use of cell phones may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Cell phone usage for illegal or dangerous activity, for purposes of harassment, or in ways that violate the company confidentiality policy may result in immediate employee termination.

# Office Security

The employer takes no responsibility for employees’ personal belongings that are lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed. Some employees are provided with a desk or a locker for their use during work. Prohibited materials, including weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, illegally-prescribed drugs or medications, etc. may not be placed in a desk or locker.

Do not make duplicate office keys. Please notify the employer immediately if your key is lost. No outside agency, inspector, visitor, inquirer, salesperson, or ex-employee may enter the treatment rooms or office from the reception room without permission.

# Workplace Surveillance Policy

In order to promote the safety of employees and company visitors, as well as the security of its facilities, Example Dental may conduct video surveillance of any portion of its premises at any time.
---
exception being private areas of restrooms, and that video cameras may be positioned in appropriate places within and around Example Dental offices and used in order to help promote the safety and security of people and property. There should be no expectation of privacy in the workplace except in private areas such as restrooms, showers and dressing areas.

# WORKPLACE VIOLENCE

Example Dental is strongly committed to providing a safe workplace. The purpose of this policy is to minimize the risk of personal injury to employees and damage to company and/or personal property. We do not expect employees to become experts in psychology or to physically subdue a threatening or violent individual. Indeed, we specifically discourage employees from engaging in any physical confrontation with a violent or potentially violent individual. However, we do expect and encourage employees to exercise reasonable judgment in identifying potentially dangerous situations.

Experts in the mental health profession state that prior to engaging in acts of violence, troubled individuals often exhibit one or more of the following behaviors or signs: over-resentment, anger and hostility; extreme agitation; making ominous threats such as bad things will happen to a particular person, or a catastrophic event will occur; sudden and significant decline in work performance; irresponsible, irrational, intimidating, aggressive or otherwise inappropriate behavior; reacting to questions with an antagonistic or overtly negative attitude; discussing weapons and their use, and/or brandishing weapons in the workplace; overreacting or reacting harshly to changes in company policies and procedures; personality conflicts with co-workers; obsession or preoccupation with a co-worker or supervisor; attempts to sabotage the work or equipment of a co-worker; blaming others for mistakes and circumstances; or demonstrating a propensity to behave and react irrationally.

# Prohibited Conduct:

Threats, threatening language or any other acts of aggression or violence made toward or by any Example Dental employee WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. For purposes of this policy, a threat includes any verbal or physical harassment or abuse, any attempt at intimidating or instilling fear in others, menacing gestures, flashing of weapons, stalking or any other hostile, aggressive, injurious or destructive action undertaken for the purpose of domination or intimidation.

# Procedures for Reporting a Threat:

All potentially dangerous situations, including threats by co-workers, should be reported immediately to any member of management with whom the employee feels comfortable. Reports of threats may be maintained confidential to the extent maintaining confidentiality does not impede the company’s ability to investigate and respond to the complaints. All threats will be promptly investigated. All employees must cooperate with all investigations. No employee will be subjected to retaliation, intimidation or disciplinary action as a result of reporting a threat in good faith under this policy.

If Example Dental determines, after an appropriate good faith investigation, that someone has violated this policy, we will take swift and appropriate corrective action.

If the employee is the recipient of a threat made by an outside party, that employee should follow the steps detailed in this section. It is important for Example Dental to be aware of any potential danger in its offices. Indeed, Example Dental wants to take effective measures to protect everyone from the threat of a violent act by employees or by anyone else.

# JOB ABANDONMENT

If you are absent from work without providing proper notification we will consider you to have resigned. If you request time off that is denied and take time off anyway, or if you fail to return from an approved absence on the agreed upon date, or if you walk off the job during your shift, the absence is considered to be job abandonment and will be treated as a voluntary resignation. Exceptions may be made to this policy if extenuating circumstances existed that resulted in your inability to properly notify us of your absence.

# WAGES AND SALARIES

# SALARY ADMINISTRATION

Example Dental will maintain a salary administration program that:

- Allows for differences in individual ability, knowledge, and skill
- Provides incentive to encourage each individual to strive for improved performance

Pay Schedule: You will be provided information regarding the payday schedule. Wages are paid according to the designated schedule unless you are notified in advance of a change. If a payday falls on a day we are closed, you will be paid on the last workday immediately preceding the closure.

Please review your paycheck for errors. If you find a mistake, report it immediately, so it can be corrected. To prevent misunderstandings later, any discrepancies must be reported within 30 days after receiving the check, or we will assume that no error has occurred.

Hours of Work: You will find your work-days and hours on the posted schedule. You are responsible for reading the schedule and being available for work when required. The workdays and hours may be increased or decreased in response to the needs of the practice.

Office requirements, due to unexpected emergencies and changes in planned procedures, occasionally make it necessary to work beyond the scheduled work hours. When overtime is required, you will be notified as much in advance as possible. The employer reserves the right to assign employees to jobs other than their usual assignments when required.

Salary Adjustments: Wages are reviewed at least once a year. Wage adjustments are discretionary and based on performance, increased skills, and the individual’s contributions to the welfare and profitability of the practice.

# ATTENDANCE RECORDS

All Employees are responsible, individually, for recording their time when:

- Reporting for work
- Leaving for lunch
- Returning from lunch
---
# Leaving at the end of the day

Whether on card or computer, your attendance records are used as a means of recording hours worked and calculating pay. They record regular hours worked, meal periods, overtime, absences, and paid time off, etc. Attendance records are legal documentation of hours worked and must not be destroyed, falsified, defaced or removed from the premises. All non-exempt employees, whether salaried or hourly, must complete and sign a weekly time record reflecting actual hours worked each day. Any mistakes or omissions on the attendance record are to be reported immediately to the employer, who then will make the necessary corrections. Do not permit another employee to enter your time for you. Likewise, do not register another employee’s time even if requested to do so.

If you have to leave the premises for any reason during the regular work period, be sure to get permission and record the time on your attendance record.

Do not sign in or start work earlier than 5 minutes before your normal starting time or sign out or stop work later than 5 minutes after your normal quitting time unless overtime has been approved in advance. This will give you a ten-minute “window” within which to check in or out without incurring overtime. Employees are not permitted to work on their own initiative before or after scheduled working hours or during unpaid meal periods or paid rest breaks unless granted written permission from a manager.

Time off for which you expect to be paid must be entered on your attendance record during the pay period in which it occurred.

# OVERTIME PAY

Example Dental defines the workweek as Sunday through Saturday. Overtime rate will be calculated at the rate of one and one-half times the hourly employee’s regular hourly rate of pay on time worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. Overtime is based on hours worked, not hours paid, so benefit hours off work (vacation, sick time, holiday) are not considered for calculating overtime.

Exempt employees are not required to be paid overtime pay.

Overtime is to be authorized in advance. Employees are not permitted to work more than their regularly scheduled hours without prior approval and may not work on their own initiative before or after scheduled working hours or during unpaid meal periods or breaks. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

# WHAT CONSTITUTES TIME WORKED

From your actual commencement of duties until the end of your workday, except for time spent at lunch or dinner, constitutes time worked. Getting ready and clean-up time, employee meetings in the beginning or during the day are also time worked. Arriving early, leaving late, or preliminary time spent in attending to personal matters such as grooming, changing clothes (unless required by the nature of the job), are not considered time worked. Do not sign in until you are ready to go to work. Likewise, do not work after you have signed off on the attendance record or computer time clock. For purposes of calculating overtime, time worked does not include paid time off.
---
# WHEN THE DOCTOR IS AWAY

When the doctor is away from the office and therefore not seeing patients, it provides the employees an opportunity to complete unfinished tasks. Check with the doctor or the office manager, no later than the day before, to determine if your presence is required while the doctor is gone. For example, the clinical employees may be asked to take the time off and the administrative employees to come to work to answer the phone and get caught up, etc. If your presence is not required at the office, you may, with approval:

- Take time off without pay
- Take time off and use paid time off you have earned but not used. Please indicate on your attendance record if you would like to use PTO hours.

# INCLEMENT WEATHER AND INACTIVE TIME PAY

This policy establishes guidelines during periods of extreme weather conditions, emergencies or special circumstances.

Unless an emergency closing is announced, all employees are expected to report to work. However, all employees are urged to use their own discretion in deciding whether they can commute safely to work. If the weather or other emergency conditions prevent employees from reporting to work or arriving on time, you are required to notify the office manager no later than 7:00 a.m. on that day.

When unable to report to work because of weather conditions, or if inactive time is necessitated, the time off may be without pay (exceptions may be made at the employer’s discretion). If the time off is without pay, hourly paid employees have the option of using any paid time off they have earned. Salaried employees may, at the employer’s discretion, be paid for hours not worked due to inclement weather or other inactive time.

# COMPENSATORY TIME OFF (COMP TIME)

Comp Time is receiving time off in-lieu-of overtime payments when overtime is worked and it is not permitted.

# CONTINUING EDUCATION AND TRAINING

You will be compensated for time spent in employer-mandated and documented lectures, meetings or training programs as required by federal and/or state law.

Expense reimbursement for the continuing education event that has been agreed upon will be determined at the employer’s discretion and in accordance with state and federal minimum wage laws.

- Types of expenses to be considered may include:
---
Instead of a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, you may be allowed a per-diem amount to cover daily expenses.

Within 30-days of the course completion, please submit the following for reimbursement of the agreed upon expenses:

- Evidence of completion of the course
- Copies of receipts for incurred expenses

Copies of certificates and units earned will be maintained in your personnel file.

You will be compensated wages for applicable travel time to and from Employer mandated and documented lectures, meetings or training programs as required by federal and/or state law.

# DIFFERENT CAPACITY WORK RATE

Non-exempt employees may be paid a separate straight-time rate of pay for dissimilar types of work performed during the same workweek, which may include team meetings, training, and continuing education. Traveling to or attending a seminar or workshop are considered dissimilar types of work than the work conducted during a normal workday. The time may therefore be paid at a different rate from your regular rate of pay while attending such seminars or workshops.

# RECERTIFICATION

For the purposes of recertification, any continuing education requirement must be managed (planned and scheduled) by you. Please arrange to attend courses during the hours you are not scheduled to work.

Upon completion of recertification, please provide us with a copy of the renewed license. Example Dental assumes no responsibility for employees who become delinquent in the number of units needed for recertification and who, consequently, lose their license.

# EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

# EMPLOYEE CLASSIFICATION

For purposes of employee benefits eligibility, employees are classified according to specific terms and definitions. However, all employees, including new employees, are “at-will” employees. The employee classifications are:

New Employees—employees who are employed for less than ninety (90) calendar days are considered new employees. This initial time of employment is considered the orientation and training period. The duration of the orientation and training period can be extended at the employer’s discretion.

New employees do not earn nor are they eligible for benefits during the orientation and training period. Upon satisfactory completion of the orientation and training period, they are:

- Considered potentially qualified
- Reclassified as a regular or temporary employee
---
# Employee Classification

- Enrolled to participate in applicable benefit plan(s)
- Informed of the above

# Regular Full-Time Employees

Employees who are paid either a salary or an hourly rate and who regularly work 36 hours within a workweek. Under special conditions (illness, etc.) a regular full-time employee may work fewer hours in a week for up to three (3) months without losing regular full-time status. With mutual consent between employer and employee, this time may be extended.

# Regular Part-Time Employees

Employees who work less than the number of hours regularly worked by full-time employees are considered regular part-time employees.

# Temporary Full-Time Employees

Employees whose service is intended to be of limited duration and who work the same number of weekly hours worked by regular full-time employees are considered temporary full-time employees. Temporary full-time employees are not eligible for benefits.

# Temporary Part-Time Employees

Employees whose service is intended to be of limited duration and who normally work fewer hours than those worked by regular full-time employees. Temporary part-time employees are not eligible for benefits.

# Exempt Employees

Employees who are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) as amended and/or applicable state law are considered exempt employees. Such employees include employees who qualify as an exempt executive, administrative, professional employees, outside sales persons, and computer programmer/analysts.

# Non-Exempt Employees

Employees who are not exempt from the minimum wage, overtime and timecard provisions of the FLSA and/or applicable state law are considered non-exempt employees.

# Change in Employee Status

A change in status may result by a decision made by the employer or by an employee having regularly worked the number of hours worked by employees in another status. Employees who change from part-time to full-time status receive new employee status and are subject to all policies pertaining to new employees (see above). For example, if full-time employees earn a one week paid vacation after one year of service, and three weeks after five years, the former part-time employee must complete one year of full-time service before earning a one week vacation, and five years before earning three weeks of paid vacation.

At the employer’s discretion, employees who change from part-time status to full-time status may receive a 50% service credit for years previously worked as a part-time employee. For example, a part-time employee who has worked for the practice 4 years would receive a service credit of 2 years.

# PERSONAL TIME OFF (PTO)

Example Dental will grant PTO on the basis of hours worked and tenureship with the company. You will be eligible to start accumulation and usage on the 91st day of employment.

|Base Rate (Less than twelve(12) Months)|0.0192 hours per one(1) worked (1 week/year)|
|---|---|
|1st Anniversary|0.0289 hours per one(1) worked (1.5 weeks/year)|
|2nd Anniversary|0.0385 hours per one(1) worked (2 weeks/year)|
|5th Anniversary|0.0577 hours per one(1) worked (3 weeks/year)|

Employees are allowed to accumulate a maximum balance of Eighty (80) hours of PTO at any time.
---
# Personal Time Off Request

A personal time off request form must be filled out thirty (30) days prior to your last day of work and require a manager’s approval. Example Dental will attempt to have employees stagger planned time off in an effort to avoid affecting production. Therefore granting of time off requests will be solely at the discretion of management, the manager or area supervisor who will make every effort to accommodate each employee.

# PTO Provisions

PTO may be taken at any time the employee is eligible with the following provisions:

- Employees are expected to take their paid personal time as a means of rest and diversion for themselves and their families.
- If two or more employees request the same time off, the employer reserves the right to approve time off requests based on employee seniority as defined by length of employment.
- A paid company holiday that falls during the personal time off period will be considered as a paid holiday and not personal time off.
- Accrued PTO time will not be paid as excess wages.

Pay for PTO will be at the employee’s regular rate of pay. Paid PTO will not be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime for hourly employees. Any remaining accrued PTO hours will be paid at the employee’s termination.

You may be required to take time off while the doctor is on vacation.

If you fail to return from personal time off on the scheduled date, the failure to return will be considered job abandonment and treated as a voluntary termination.

# Sick Time / Sick Leave

Example Dental recognizes that employees will need days off from work from time to time to address their medical needs.

Employees accrue sick leave as follows:

- All regular employees accrue sick leave from their 91st day of employment, at a rate of 0.0096 hours per one (1) hour worked.
- Sick leave may be accrued to a maximum of 64 hours.

Sick leave may be used in accordance with the following provisions:

- Sick leave may not be used prior to accrual.
- If sick leave is exhausted, annual leave will be used in its place.
- Sick leave may be used for an employee's personal illness, well-care and medical and dental appointments. Sick leave also may be used for illness and well-care of a member of an employee's immediate family (including the employee’s spouse, children, mother and father).
- An employee who has a sick leave absence in excess of three consecutive work days must present medical documentation for the absence.
- If the employee is absent unexpectedly due to personal or a family member's illness, the employee should notify his or her supervisor or the director of human resources as soon as reasonably possible.
- Employees are not paid for unused sick leave upon termination of employment.
---
If a sudden illness makes it impossible for an employee to request sick leave before the workday begins, the employee should notify the office manager no later than one hour before the start of the workday. If an employee is too ill to place the call, have a relative or other responsible individual make the call. Failure to follow this procedure will void the claim for paid sick leave and can be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination.

If you are absent due to illness for more than three consecutive days, please bring a certified healthcare practitioner’s certificate verifying the reason for your absence. The note should also state that you are able to perform your regular work assignment and state if there are any restrictions pertaining to your duties or the number of hours you can work. However, at the employer’s discretion, you may be required to bring a certified healthcare practitioner’s certificate verifying the medical reason for your absence, when you are absent for less than three days.

If you have earned sick leave for the time out ill and expect to be paid, please indicate this on your attendance record so we can be sure to pay you for the day.

# Medical Leave of Absence

If you are unable to return to work within six working days, you may be put on a leave of absence. Any earned and unused sick leave must be taken before the beginning of a leave of absence. Paid sick time is not earned while on a leave of absence.

Employees who know in advance that they will be absent for health reasons must give advance notice, including the probable start date and duration of the absence. A healthcare provider’s statement must be submitted in writing verifying the reason for the disability and the leave’s beginning and expected ending dates.

During a leave of absence because of illness, you are to notify the employer daily of progress unless otherwise agreed upon.

The medical leave of absence is without pay. You do not accrue seniority while on a leave of absence. Benefit hours are not accrued during the leave but will begin to accrue according to the applicable policy when you return to work.

If you take a leave because of a personal serious health condition, you must provide a note from your physician verifying that you are able to return to work and can assume your regular work duties. The letter must also state if there are any restrictions pertaining to duties or the number of hours you can work.

Unless applicable state or local laws require otherwise, reinstatement cannot be guaranteed to any employee returning from medical leave. We will endeavor to place employees returning from leave in their former position or in a position comparable in status and pay, subject to budgetary restrictions, the company’s need to fill vacancies, and the ability to find qualified temporary replacements.

Accepting outside or supplemental employment while on a leave will result in the employee’s discharge.

Your employment with the practice may end if any of the following occurs:

- When not returning to work on the scheduled day of return
- When the purpose for requesting the leave was misrepresented
- When the request for a leave of absence is denied and you take time off anyway
- When, for business and economic reasons, the job is not available
---
# Notice of an Employee’s return to work after a medical leave of absence

Notice of an Employee’s return to work after a medical leave of absence must be given in advance so that scheduling adjustments can be made.

# HOLIDAYS

At certain times of the year, we will observe holidays and, therefore, we will be closed. To offset any loss of wages, these observed holiday closures will be paid, as outlined below.

# Regular Full-Time Employees

—after successful completion of the orientation and training period, you are eligible for paid holidays.

# Regular Part-Time Employees

—after successful completion of the orientation and training period, you are eligible for paid holidays. The days below will be observed as paid holidays:

|Holidays|Observed|
|---|---|
|New Year’s Day|January 1|
|Good Friday|Friday before Easter Sunday|
|Memorial Day|Last Monday in May|
|Independence Day|July 4|
|Labor Day|First Monday in September|
|Thanksgiving Day|Fourth Thursday in November|
|Day after Thanksgiving|Fourth Friday in November|
|Christmas Eve Day|December 24|
|Christmas Day|December 25|

These holidays will only be paid when they fall on a day you are regularly scheduled to work and the office is closed. In some cases, we may choose to substitute a different day for the actual holiday if it falls on a day we wouldn’t normally work, in which case, that day will become the paid holiday.

# To be eligible for holiday pay, you must:

- Normally be scheduled to work on the day the holiday is observed and the office is closed
- Work on the last regularly scheduled workday before the holiday and the next regularly scheduled workday following the holiday, unless you are on a pre-approved absence or are using available paid sick leave
- Not be on a leave of absence

Holiday pay is equivalent to the hours worked in your regular workday. Therefore, if you would have worked 8 hours on the day the holiday is observed, your holiday pay will be 8 hours. Paid holidays are not counted as hours worked for overtime calculation purposes.

If you choose to use any available paid time off during a period when a holiday is observed, the day will still count as a paid holiday. Your paid time off balance will not be reduced for the paid holiday.
---
# RETIREMENT PLAN

At this time, a retirement plan package is under development.

# MEDICAL BENEFITS

At this time, a medical benefits package is under development.

# DENTAL BENEFITS

Specified regular employees will receive the following dental benefits with the provisions outlined below. Dental benefits cover the type of general dentistry that is normally performed within the practice. Dentists who are specialists (i.e. Orthodontists, Periodontists, etc.) may, upon request, make exceptions on an individual employee basis.

Regular Full-Time and Part-Time Employees—after completing 3 months of uninterrupted employment, regular full-time and part-time employees receive a 100 percent courtesy discount on dental treatment excluding lab fees for themselves, their spouse and children up to age 25.

Employees who are not covered by a separate dental insurance plan will be charged separately for the cost of lab fees or special materials.

Before receiving treatment employees have to complete a comprehensive health history as well as commit to taking full responsibility to pay for the treatment that is not covered by the courtesy offered by the employer.

Treatment may be scheduled during regular working hours, possibly to fill for a no-show or short-notice cancellation, or outside working hours at the employer’s discretion. If dental treatment is scheduled during regular working hours, the time involved is not considered work time and employees are to sign out for attendance purposes and sign back in when returning to work.

If employment is terminated for any reason, you will owe the balance and arrange for payment on the same basis as any other patient with an outstanding balance. If needed, continuation of treatment will be charged at the regular rate.

# HEPATITIS B VACCINATION

Hepatitis B vaccination is made available to employees who are reasonably expected to be in contact with blood (or its products) in the performance of their duties. The vaccination is made available within 10 days of the initial assignment to employees who have not already been vaccinated. The employer will pay the immunization expense. Employees who decline to have the vaccination will be asked to sign a formal statement of declination but may later change their mind.

# BREASTFEEDING AND EXPRESSING MILK RIGHTS

We support our female employees’ right to breastfeed and/or express milk. If our female employees choose to do so during work hours, they may use a private area for this purpose up to one year after the birth of a child. Reasonable unpaid time for breaks will be provided each day to be used for breastfeeding or expressing milk. Break times must be mutually agreed upon by the employer and employee. This is intended to allow employees who are new mothers to return to work more easily.
---
# MEAL PERIOD

You will be scheduled for an unpaid meal period of at least 30 minutes after no more than five hours of work. An employee may not work through a mandatory meal period or be allowed to shorten the work day by a corresponding period of time. There are two exceptions:

1. You may (with the employer’s permission) voluntarily agree to waive the right to a meal period, provided the work day is no more than six hours;
2. A paid working meal period may be permitted if the nature of the work does not permit you to be released from duty and you have entered into a written agreement with the employer for a working paid “on duty meal period”.

# JURY DUTY

When called to serve on jury duty, you are to submit a copy of the summons to the employer or your manager immediately. You are also required to submit certification from the court listing the actual days of service.

If you are called to serve on jury duty, you will be given a Leave of Absence. All employees will be paid their regular wages, less the amount paid by the court, while on jury duty. Please submit a copy of the compensation received from the jury service for our payroll records.

If you are released before the end of the workday, you are to return to work for the balance of the day.

# WORKERS’ COMPENSATION

Employees are covered by workers’ compensation insurance for work-related injuries or occupational diseases. Example Dental pays the cost of this insurance.

Workers’ compensation benefits provide medical, surgical, and hospital treatment, in addition to payment for loss of earnings that result from work-related injuries. Benefits include:

- Cash benefits for both impairment and disability (disability payments cover certain physical problems, while impairment benefits cover disability and loss of wages)
- Medical benefits within the legislated limits
- Rehabilitation benefits, including both medical rehabilitation and vocational training for cases involving severe disabilities
- Compensation paid to an injured worker is decided by a rate set by law-usually a percentage of a regular weekly wage with a fixed maximum and minimum amount, subject to a total maximum limitation figure
- Compensation payments typically begin from the first day of an employee’s hospitalization or after the third day following the injury if an employee is not hospitalized

Reporting Injuries: If you are injured while working, notify the employer immediately and fill out the Accident Report Form, regardless of how minor the injury may be. Failure to report an accident can result in a violation of legal requirements, and can lead to difficulties in processing benefit and insurance.
---
The practice will not pay for any medical treatment given before the employer was made aware of the injury.

Serious injuries or illnesses involving time off or work-related deaths must be reported to the branch of the government responsible for workers’ compensation. The employer will file injury reports with the insurance carrier within five days after the injury occurs. Check the posted information for the name of the insurance carrier and the expiration date of the present insurance coverage.

Our insurer regularly reviews and audits medical claims for indications of fraud. Persons who willfully make false statements or conceal material facts to obtain disability benefits may be punished by both imprisonment and fines. The employer does not discriminate or retaliate against employees who have filed legitimate workers’ compensation claims.

# Disclaimer Notice:

The employer or the insurance carrier may not be liable for the payment of any workers’ compensation benefits for any injury that arises out of an employee’s voluntary participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity that is not part of the employee’s work-related duties.

# ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE

Being under the influence of any drug or alcoholic beverage on the job poses a serious risk to employees’ and patients’ health and safety. Therefore, employees are strictly prohibited from the illicit use, possession, sale, conveyance, distribution, or manufacture of illegal drugs, intoxicants, or controlled substances. Illegal activity and substance abuse, both on and off the job, can lead to termination.

In addition, employees are strictly prohibited from the abuse of alcohol and prescription drugs. Legally prescribed medications are only permitted within the practice to the extent that the uses of such medications do not adversely affect your job performance, your safety or that of others. If you are using a drug or a medically prescribed medication that is known or advertised as possibly affecting or impairing judgment, coordination, or other senses or which may adversely affect the ability to perform work in a safe and productive manner, it is your responsibility to advise the doctor of this fact before reporting to work.

# Drug and Alcohol Testing:

If there is reasonable cause to suspect that you are under the influence of any illegal or non-prescribed drugs, you may be required to immediately submit to a medical examination and/or to submit to urine, blood, saliva, breath, and/or hair testing for drugs or alcohol. The reasonable cause may be related to appearance, behavior, speech, excessive absenteeism, frequent accidents, declining performance, and situations involving safety, security, or accidents. Reasonable cause may also involve retesting workers who have completed or are in a rehabilitation program. Employee acceptance of medical examinations and testing is a condition of employment. Therefore, refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test will be considered equivalent to a confirmed “positive” test and will result in immediate disciplinary action which may include discharge.

# Inspections to Administer and Enforce Policy:

In order to promote a safe, productive, and efficient workplace, the employer reserves the right to inspect any articles and property in the employees’ possession. The inspection may include lockers, desks, boxes, packages, lunch boxes, containers, and any other object on practice property.

# Notification of Criminal Charges:

Any employee charged with alleged use or possession of drugs or convicted of a criminal drug statute must notify the employer in writing within five calendar days.
---
Violation of this Alcohol and Drug policy will result in adverse employment action up to and including dismissal and referral for criminal prosecution.

# Employee Assistance

Employees with substance abuse problems are urged to seek help. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) provide information and support. Local chapters are listed in the telephone directory.

# Employee Relations

# Non Disclosure

The practice makes available to each employee certain confidential information, including but not limited to patients’ names, treatment histories, medical records, addresses, communications, files, bills and payment records; as well as office forms, manuals, etc. These items are of substantial value, highly confidential, and constitute the professional and trade secrets of the employer. They are provided and disclosed to the employee solely for use in connection with the employment.

In adherence with HIPAA regulations and this confidential and non-disclosure policy, each employee shall:

- Regard and preserve the information as highly confidential and the trade secrets of the employer. Such information is not to be discussed away from the premises or within hearing distance of any patient or unauthorized person.
- Not disclose, nor permit to be disclosed, any of the information to any person or entity.
- Not photocopy or duplicate, and shall not permit any person to photocopy or duplicate, any of the information without employer’s consent and approval.
- Not make use of the information for their own benefit or the benefit of any person or entity other than the employer.
- Not continue to keep any information after termination of employment.

Employees are not to release personal information regarding present or former employees, that is, phone number, address, etc., without the employee’s specific and prior approval in writing.

Employees handling confidential information, including personnel files, are responsible for its security and extreme care is to be exercised to ensure that it is safeguarded to protect the practice, each employee, the suppliers, the patients, and the employer. Any employee who violates this confidentiality and disclosure policy is subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge, and possible legal action.

Although not intended to discourage employee’s creativity, any system, idea, or communication developed during your employment with the practice is the property of the practice and remains so even after termination.

# Personnel Records

The employer must keep certain personnel records in order to comply with legislated record keeping and reporting requirements. These records are confidential and only available to authorized personnel.
---
Employees who access their own or co-worker’s confidential employee files without authorization will be disciplined.

# Security and Confidentiality

—the physical safety and privacy of personnel records must be secured at all times. Physical safeguards include locked files and/or special computer access codes. Entry to the files is strictly limited to authorized personnel only on a need-to-know basis.

# Inspection of Records

An employee can request copies of any documents that the employee previously had provided to the employer or that had previously been provided to the employee. An employee can add a statement to qualify or counter information in their personnel files. The statement must be factual and directly relevant to the employee’s performance or employment qualifications.

175
---
A third party may subpoena employment records from a current or former employer. If employment records are subpoenaed, the employee must be notified and has the right to object to production of the records.

# PERSONAL DATA CHANGES

Employees are requested to help keep their records up-to-date by informing the employer of any changes in personal information. So that we can keep the records updated, please report any of the following changes when they occur:

# PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCEDURE

The purpose of a resolution procedure is to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all employees. We are eager to learn of any condition that may be causing problems for you on the job. Such conditions cannot be corrected unless you make them known. A problem may involve work conditions, policies, alleged discrimination, harassment, or anything else that prevents a fair and productive work environment.

You are encouraged to use the following procedure so a problem can be addressed and resolved as soon as possible. Please state the situation as clearly as possible, preferably in writing, within ten working days after you become aware of the situation. Any complaints of harassment must be reported immediately to either the office manager or the owner, who will then follow through according to the harassment policy described earlier in this manual.

# Step 1. The Office Manager

(If not applicable, go to step 2)

- The office manager checks the circumstances and provides a solution to the problem within five working days
- In the event you are not satisfied that the problem has been resolved—proceed with Step 2

# Step 2. The Employer

- The employee brings the situation to the attention of the owner in writing within ten working days
- The owner investigates the circumstances and returns a decision within five working days
---
The owner’s decision on a given issue does not set precedence for future decisions areas.

# RESPONSIBILITY AND CONDUCT

Certain standards of personal integrity and human behavior are an integral part of good character and respect for the rights of others. Unprofessional conduct disrupts the orderly flow of business, hurts morale, and lessens the quality of patient care. As we explained elsewhere in this handbook, employment with the practice is at the mutual consent of the employee and the employer, and employment may be discontinued at-will, at any time, by either the employee or the employer, with or without cause or advance notice. Although we do not exercise a formal system of discipline, an employee may, at the employer’s discretion, be given a warning and the opportunity to correct a problem before discharge. The employer reserves the right to take any disciplinary action as deemed appropriate.

Identifying every type of conduct or performance considered unprofessional is impossible. However, we note again the four Core Values to use as guidance--fantastic guest experience, always be improving, hungry and humbly confident, have each other’s backs. In addition, we provide the following examples of conduct and performance problems that could result in disciplinary action, including discharge:

1. Unexcused or repeated absences or tardiness
2. Unauthorized personal telephone calls or attending to personal affairs during work hours
3. Misuse of electronic e-mail or internet communications system
4. Working unauthorized overtime
5. Destruction or negligent abuse of office property
6. Refusal to work scheduled or emergency overtime
7. Posting, removing, or tampering with posted notices without permission
8. Leaving premises during working hours without authorization
9. The use of any equipment owned by the practice for personal reasons without permission
10. Mishandling, misappropriation, or unauthorized removal or possession of the funds or property of the employer or other employees
11. The use of any practice-owned equipment, including computers without permission
12. Personal behavior outside the office which could be harmful to the reputation of the practice
13. Inability to establish rapport with the employer, other employees or patients
14. Unsatisfactory work performance and/or attitude
15. Violation of any employer policy, including policies described in this manual, as revised from time to time
16. Improper disclosure of confidential information or adherence to all HIPAA requirements, including information contained in employee records
17. Falsifying or destroying any records, including timekeeping records
18. Reporting to work or working while under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs
19. Possession of alcohol or illegal drugs while on duty or on the employer’s premises
20. Illegal activity and substance abuse, both on and off the job
21. Disloyalty, insubordination, misconduct, and/or engaging in rude or discourteous conduct
22. Refusing to accept a reasonable and proper assignment
23. Recording information or tampering with another employee’s attendance record
24. Falsifying, making inaccurate entries, or omitting requested information on the employment application form or other company records
25. The employer’s good faith belief that employee has knowingly given false statement(s)

# 27. Non-compliance with acts and rules of the State Board of Examiners

# 28. The possession of firearms within the practice

# 29. Failure to use assigned safety equipment or failure to abide by safety rules and policies

# 30. Creating or contributing to unsanitary conditions

# 35. Discussing work-related issues within hearing distance of patients

# 36. Failure to report to work without providing adequate notice as described elsewhere in this handbook

# 37. Accessing their own or co-worker’s confidential employee files without authorization

# 38. Abusive or bullying behavior towards others

# SEPARATION FROM EMPLOYMENT

Employees serve “at-will” and those who quit, are discharged, or fail to respond to a recall; will be regarded as separated from employment.

Separations are classified as either voluntary or involuntary and will be processed in accordance with the separation policies and procedures that follow.

# Voluntary:

A voluntary separation is a resignation initiated by the employee. We realize that occasionally an employee resigns to pursue other interests. Although you may resign at-will, at any time, with or without cause or advance notice, you are requested to provide at least two weeks’ advance notice, in writing.

Although an employee may give several weeks’ notice, the employer may find it inefficient, disruptive or undesirable to permit the employee to work for the period specified and reserves the right to accelerate the effective date of the resignation. In-lieu-of-notice pay may be awarded at the employer’s discretion.

Unauthorized Leave: If you request time off that is denied, and take the time off anyway, that time off will be considered job abandonment and treated as a voluntary termination.

# Involuntary:

A permanent separation initiated by the employer for any reason, i.e. lack of work, inability to perform satisfactorily the duties of the position, reorganization and/or relocation, unprofessional conduct, practice being sold, etc.

The above items are not intended to show all the possibilities that might result in involuntary release from employment.

# RETURN OF PROPERTY

If you quit, any property belonging to the practice must be returned on or before your last day of work. If your employment is terminated, any property belonging to the practice must be returned immediately.

Items may include uniforms, keys, manuals, equipment, etc. Your cooperation is appreciated. We reserve the right to take any legal action necessary to ensure our property is returned.

I have received the handbook (Version of 6/22/2019), and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and comply with the policies contained in this handbook and any revisions made to it.

# Associate Checklist

Use this Checklist sheet below when you’re looking to possibly hire a new Associate Dentist.

# Assessment Phase


# Before placing a Job Ad

This phase can be done quickly as it is all in-house analytics and discussing with your coach or others. Make sure you are ready for growth in all its forms, from adding team members, to expanding collections. This will put more stress on all aspects of your organization, and so be ready to grow in all areas from front desk to clinical positions after a while. At first however, these are the things you need to look at:

1. Do you have enough patient flow to keep the Associate Busy?

- New patients per month, Attrition, and Emergency patient flow go into this
2. Do you have enough physical space to allow an associate?

- This includes either chairs to be used concurrently, or switching scheduling to go with expanded hours
3. Do you have the staff/team to allow this to happen?

- Associate will usually need at least 1 FT assistant, 1 Hygienist, and may include more front desk time
4. Financially: Do you have enough cash on hand to cover 4 months of their base salary?

- Remember, payments on new doctors will take usually 3-4 months to come in before they become financially stable themselves
---
# Hiring Phase

# Hiring the Right Person

Hereʼs quite a few of the steps in hiring the right person. In today's job market, things might move faster or slower depending on the flow of applicants and how things proceed, but this is a good summary of most of the steps youʼll need to help you in the process.

# Step 1

Prepare a Job Ad with text, how you will advertise, and where you will advertise

- See example Job ad in DSN Operations Manual
- Where to place it?
- Facebook (Private) groups
- Indeed
- ZipRecruiter
- Craigslist
- Dental Specific Job Websites?
- Other Ways-
- personal connections, spread word in the community
- AEGD, GPR Programs, Dental Schools- send nicely done brochures
- Mailings
- Buy a mailing list from your local State Dental Board, or other list
- Send letter to those you identify as possible targets

# Step 2

Create a Brochure if needed

- Have a graphic designer help to spruce it up, make it look high-high quality

# Step 3

Start accepting applications

- Some associates will think they are a lock for your position, remember to always portray this as an interview process

# Step 4

Phone Interview

- Could be a Zoom interview as well (Plan for 30 minutes in this case)
- Do a 10-15 minute phone call to see if they’re even in the ballpark for wanting to join your practice as an associate
- Portray this as a check before trying to meet up physically

# Step 5

Pre-Employment Testing

- Use DSN Pre-Employment Questionnaire to help identify more questions you might want to probe during a physical interview
- HireSelect Pre-Employment Tests- Personality and Skills Testing ($$)
- www.16personalities.com for FREE tests

181
---
# 6 In-Person Interview

- Doc with Doc is #1
- If they pass- then do Doctors with Spouses- maybe a dinner?
- If they pass that level, then do New Doctor with Staff
- The team will definitely let you know if there’s something about the new doctor that is a red flag

# 7 Give Explainer Contract and Full Contract

- Full Contract is the fully-executable version
- Explainer Contract is the contract- with a bunch of notes written in by you that could explain to a future employee why you’re paying certain %, why you include lab bill, how things are calculated, etc

# 8 NOTE: Until the contract is signed, they are not ‘HIRED’

- Each part of the process up to this point tells you something about the applicant
- If they act odd during the contract negotiation phase, this might tell you they won’t be a good fit for your practice, it’s ok to walk away at this point

# 8 They sign the contract

- Create a folder on your computer/Google Drive
- Scan/Import all their documents
- Import signed contract
- Send them a copy

# 9 Request all documents to help them On-Board correctly

- Dental License

# 10 Prepare all documents for the next section

# Key Production Indicators (KPIs)

At EXAMPLE Dental, we want to hold ourselves to an internal scorecard of being the BEST we can be. Aligning with our core values, we have a few KPIs that are important indicators of ‘playing the game at a high level’.

# WIGs for 2020

- Achieve 500 Google Reviews by End-of-Year
- 1,200 New Patients for the year
- $XXXX Million in Revenue for 2020

# KPIs for Hygiene to help achieve these goals:

- Net production is 3.3X Hourly Wage
- If your hourly wage is $35/hour...your goal is to produce $115.50 per hour after all deductions
- On average this is highly achievable with a typical prophy, exam, and 50% of patients taking BW or 2 PA, Fluoride helps as well
- 90% of Patients getting Fluoride
- Typically almost all patients can be helped by getting topical fluoride treatment
- If they fall into a moderate or high risk caries, or other applicable condition, Fluoride should be a recommended treatment
- 90% of patients scheduled for their recare appointments
- If patients aren’t scheduled, they are likely to fall out of our practice and they may go for years.
- Getting an appointment on the books is of great importance
- 85% Treatment Acceptance Rate
- We are on the conservative side of the spectrum at EXAMPLE Dental
- Treatment recommended by Doctors in the Urgent or Important Category need to be scheduled
- Hygiene can help achieve this by educating patients about their condition to be an adjunct voice of the doctor
- 5-Star Google Reviews & New Patients
- Of course the highest recommendation from any patient is to send friends or give a nice Google Review
- Hygienists can help by mentioning the giveaways that we have at each office for reviews
- Also giving out wine, t-shirts, or other gifts can bring forth increased reviews or referrals

4. Trim the models with the grinder, making sure the palate is either empty or has a hole in it to allow maximum suction so the trays fit correctly
5. Hand scale models to define margins and get rid of any bubbles or imperfections in stone
6. Heat up vacuum machine in the lab
7. Melt the Soft EVA .040 bleach tray material and vacuum to models
8. Let the material cool down and then separate the material from the models

# Chapter 5

# Patient Experience

If there is one thing that has contributed to the exponential growth of many practices around the country in the past few years, it can be correlated to the high quality patient experience. A high quality patient experience can turn any normal patient into a ‘raving fan’, as authors Bowles and Blanchard explained in their NYT Best-selling Book by the same name.

With a large percentage of the population not utilizing the dentist on a regular basis, we need to expect from the first patient interaction that the patient, or ‘guest’ as we use, is afraid of the dentist and we need to win them over with an amazing experience. Below are the documents that help turn a normal interaction into a ‘fantastic guest experience’.

Watch the video introduction to this section on Patient Experience →

1. # Phone Call Experience

a. This document is a comprehensive look at the phone call experience as given out by Dr. Jason Tanoory and the Finger Lakes Dental Care Team. It summarizes the different types of callers, as well as the big rules of phone calls which we call the 3 E’s: Energy, Empathy, and Edification.

b. This document also summarizes the script of a phone call to confirm a patient visit.
2. # Transition Scripts - Transfers of Trust

a. Typically the transition between team members can be a shaky experience for a patient unless it is done well. This can lead to confusion and inadequate information being passed from one team member to another. This awkwardness creates a poor patient experience. To avoid this, make sure to script out each ‘transfer of trust’ and practice.

241
---
# 3. Office Tour

One of the first things a new patient gets in our offices is a ‘tour’ of the office. This creates more of a concierge-type experience, and enhances patient perception about the office. While it seems crazy to practice a ‘tour’, we know that the more patients know about our office, the more comfortable they feel. The more comfortable they are, the more they are likely to accept the recommendations for needed treatment. Check out this document and create your own to have a good office tour.

# 4. New Patient Powerpoint

During a new patient, it is good to start to level-set expectations and educate the patient about the dental outcomes that might happen during the appointment. This includes why we take radiographs, as well as what we do in certain situations. Dr. Mathew Standridge, an expert from Yates Center, Kansas, created this powerpoint many years ago and still uses it today. He encourages hygienists to use this for about 2 minutes during the New Patient Flow, showing it on a screen to a patient and educating about what is about to happen.

# Phone Call Experience

Once again we are thankful to Dr. Jason Tanoory for sharing this wonderful resource. Learn more about this Black Belt, multiple-practice owner at www.fingerlakesdental.com.

Answering the telephone in a dental practice is perhaps the most important element to maximum practice growth and patient retention. All of the marketing efforts, both internal and external, filter through the front desk and the initial phone call. Rapport and relationship building starts at this phone call and its importance cannot be emphasized enough.

# The Basics:

First of all, it is important for the front desk team members to understand that it is not their role to “qualify” or filter the patients that schedule appointments in your office. Time and time again, we’ve seen scheduling coordinators attempting to fill the doctor’s schedule with only “ideal” patients. This is a huge mistake. Since the potential Lifetime Value (LTV) of a dental patient is $45,000, it is imperative that all possible barriers of entry into your office are minimized or removed. Every team member must be aware that the number one goal of the initial phone call is to SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT.

# 1. Answer within three rings:

There should be one or two primary front office team members who are the most skilled at answering incoming phone calls. However, everyone in the office must be aware of the three ring rule. If the primary schedulers are on the phone or assisting another patient, any other team member must answer.
---
the phone within three rings and follow the appropriate script. ALL TEAM MEMBERS must be aware of the correct phone call protocol. If one of the primary schedulers becomes available during the call, it is acceptable to transfer the call to them.

# 2. Build Rapport:

Regardless of what is happening within the dental office, when the phone rings, the answering team member must present themselves in the friendliest and most helpful manner possible. NEVER make the caller feel as if they are an intrusion to your day. As early as possible in the interaction, get the potential patient’s first name and address them by name for the remainder of the call. Being polite and respectful at all times must be an absolute non-negotiable requirement for anyone answering the phone.

# 3. Categorize (Don’t Qualify) the Caller:

There are six main caller categories and they are listed below in order of priority. Remember that we are not there to qualify whether they are a good fit for our office. Everyone can be a great fit for us, and we are here to make sure they realize how great we are.

# The Three E’s: Keys to every phone call

1. Energy -
- High energy is a mainstay of a positive phone voice. To achieve this- SMILE physically when you answer the phone. The person on the other side will actually be able to hear this in the words you say. High energy is definitely a way of speaking and a tone of voice, so keep up the energy!
2. Empathy -
- Many people have a fear of the dentist or will tell you something on the phone that shows some sort of unfortunate feelings. With this information, show EMPATHY in comparing a similar situation you had.
- “I’ve had the same thing happen to me……”
- “You know when I had pain…”
3. Edification -
- Edify the doctor to make sure the future/new patient knows that the doctor/hygienist they will see is an expert and that this new person will help them achieve whatever they are wanting from our dental office.

Thank you for calling EXAMPLE Dental this is (Name) how may I help you?

# Types of Callers:

1. New Patient - These callers are the first priority and should be scheduled as soon as possible.
(See script below- #s 1,3)
2. Existing Patient (Scheduling an appointment) - These callers are also of high priority and should
be scheduled as soon as possible. Make sure the patient feels as though they are being
welcomed back like an old friend. (See script below- #4)
3. Existing Patient (Billing/Insurance question) - These callers are of high priority and must be
delivered the highest level of customer service. If at all possible, these callers should be referred
to the billing department in order to get the most accurate answers to their questions and to
free up the front office team to handle incoming calls. Their name and telephone number should
be collected and the call should be returned by the billing specialist within a couple of hours.
(See script below- # 7)
4. Vendors - These callers should be referred to an office manager or team member in charge of
ordering. Get them off the phone as quickly and courteously as possible and have a team
member return their call as soon as convenient. (See script below - #8)
5. Personal Calls - These calls are of low priority. There should be a policy in place that prohibits
personal calls during business hours with the exception of emergencies. (See Script below - #9)
6. Sales Calls - These are the lowest priority calls and all should be referred to an office manager or
team member. The absolute minimal phone time should be given to these types of calls. (See
script below-#10)
7. Miscellaneous Calls - These calls are any calls that don’t fit directly into any of the above
categories. Every attempt should be made to delegate returning these calls to another team
member when possible.

Thank you for calling EXAMPLE Dental this is (Name) how may I help you?

# Greeting:

Thank you for calling EXAMPLE Dental this is (Team member’s name) how can I help you smile?

The caller will then respond with a question. Here are the most common questions and appropriate responses:

# 1. Caller: Yes, I see here in the paper that you are having a new patient special for $5 Nitrous. Can you tell me a little more about that?

Team Member Response:

Yes (sir or ma’am) can I get your first name? (Restate their name), our new patient special is $5 and includes Nitrous laughing gas for the duration of any appointment with (Dr.’s name). May I schedule an appointment for you to experience our office?

# 2. Caller: I have XYZ insurance, do you accept it?

Team Member Response:

Can I get your last name? (Restate their name), we accept most dental insurances. However, there are many subtleties to insurances these days and it is very difficult to determine your level of coverage unless we contact your insurance company directly. We’d be happy to complete a complimentary benefits analysis for you when you are here for your new patient exam. (Patient’s name), we have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

(Note: Many consultants advise their clients to do anything to get a caller in the door, even if it means giving misleading information. DO NOT DO THIS! It is not the role of the front desk team to qualify and increase the barriers of entry into the practice; however, if a caller asks a direct question such as, “Do you accept XYZ insurance,” it is always best to give a straightforward and honest answer.)

# 3. Caller: I’d like to make an appointment, please.

Team Member Response: (LOOK AT FLEX PROGRAM- Is there a NAME?) Great! What is your name?

Caller: (Name)

Team Member Response: “Oh Hi (name){Match name with chart shown by Flex Pop-Up}, what day of the week works best for you to see the doctor/hygienist?”

Proceed down the decision path to make an appointment…..
---
Or if FLEX isn’t matching...then assume a new patient:

- Search Pt Name- if no result, click Add Patient under “Add New Family” on the bottom right hand corner of the Select Patient pop-up
- MAKE SURE you are not in the Select Patient pop-up when adding in the new patient info, it will not save anything but the name in that screen
- Need to be in the “Edit Patient Information” pop-up (will come up after clicking Add Patient button) for info to save

Caller: I’m a new patient.

Team Member Response: Welcome to the practice! Can I get your name?

Caller: Mary

Team Member: Okay Mary, I just need to gather a little more information from you to get you scheduled.

# Critical Information to obtain in initial New Patient phone call:

1. Name (First/Last)
2. Date of Birth
3. Phone Number/Email
4. Insurance Company (if any)
5. Ins Primary Holder/DOB of Primary and Subscriber ID Number.
6. Date of last cleaning/have pt call their previous office to release records and x-rays
7. Doctor Preference

Make sure to get the patient’s email if they have one, and mention that we will be sending the New Patient paperwork to them via email prior to their appointment if they want to save time and fill it out. OTHERWISE- Ask patient to arrive 10-15 mins early for their appointment to fill out health history

Emails are sent at 7:30pm at night, or else go to Flex and send immediately.

Team Member: Mary, are you interested in scheduling a complete exam, or are you experiencing a specific problem that you would like the doctor to take a look at?

Caller: (Option #1: toothache) I’m having a toothache and I want the doctor to let me know what I have to do to get out of pain.

Team Member Response: I’m so sorry to hear that, Mary. We save a couple of spots each day for emergency patients that are in pain. We have an opening today at (give the available times); would you like to come in today?

Caller: (Option #2: Complete Exam) No, I’m just interested in a check-up and cleaning.

Team Member Response: Great! Lets find a time to get you in to meet our wonderful doctors.

# 4.

Caller: Hi, this is Marvin Townson and I need to make an appointment for a crown with (Dr.’s name).

Team Member’s Response: Hi Marvin! It’s so great to hear from you! Let’s get you in right away for that procedure. What’s your birthdate and I can pull up your chart? We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# 5.

Caller: How much do you charge for (X)?

Team Member Response: (Sir or Ma’am), Are you new to our practice or are you an existing patient?

Caller: I’m not currently a patient at your office.

Team Member Response: Ok (sir or ma’am), can I get your name?

Caller: John.

Team Member Response: John, have you recently visited another dentist that told you that you needed (X)?

Caller: Yes, and now I’m calling around to see how much other dentist’s charge for (X).

Team Member’s Response: John, it is our office’s policy to always give a second opinion exam free of charge. This doesn’t mean just a free exam where we charge for an x-ray, we mean FREE. Since each dentist diagnoses and treatment plans differently, it is difficult to say whether (Dr.’s name) will have the same treatment recommendations. Would you like to come in for a complimentary second opinion exam? We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# 6.

Caller: Hi, I had a horrible dental experience about twenty years ago and I haven’t been back to a dentist since. I’m really embarrassed about the condition of my mouth but I’m deathly afraid of dentists. Is your dentist gentle?

Team Member’s Response: (Sir and Ma’am) I’m so glad you called; can I get your first name?

Caller: Lisa.

Team Member’s Response: First of all Lisa, this is a “no judgment office,” and we understand that a lot of people have had bad dental experiences in the past...so there is absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. (Dr.’s name) is extremely kind and gentle with (his/her) patients- and we even have the ability to do IV sedation in our office in case you are extremely nervous. If you visit our website at (practice’s website address), you’ll see dozens of testimonials of happy patients. We have an opening on (offer an appointment day and time.) May I schedule that appointment for you?

# 7.

Caller: I have a question about this statement that you sent me.

Team Member’s Response: Certainly (sir or Ma’am), can I get your first and last name?
---
Caller: Jack Butler

Team Member’s Response: Thanks Mr. Butler. I am going to pull up your account information right now and forward it over to the billing department. (Team member’s name) from the billing department will return your call within two hours. Is there anything else that I can help you with Mr. Butler?

8. Caller: Hello, this is Kelly for Titan Dental Supply. Can I speak with (Dr.’s name)?

Team Member’s Response: Hi Kelly, (Dr.’s name) is in with a patient right now. (Team member’s name) is in charge of ordering. I’ll leave a message for her to call you as soon as possible. Thank you!

9. Caller: This is Mike, Jennifer’s boyfriend, can I talk to her?

Team Member’s Response: Jennifer is with a patient right now, if this is an emergency, I can give her a message.

10. Caller: Is (Dr.’s name) available?

Team Member’s Response: Dr. Costes is with a patient right now, can I take a message?

Caller: Yes, this is John from ABC office supply and I wanted to talk to him/her about his office supply needs.

Team Member’s Response: Our office manager (Team member’s name) is responsible for all of our office supplies. If you’d like to leave a message, I’ll have her call you back as soon as possible. Thank you.

# The Confirmation Call Script

This call is important because it is the last interaction that the team will have prior to the first in-person visit to the office. Although this conversation should be quick and to the point, it should set the tone for the upcoming visit. The team member must have an upbeat, friendly and helpful demeanor. Remember, we are “inviting” the prospective patient to join the practice.

# LIVE CALL: (See Confirmation Schedule to see if this call is made)

Front Desk Team Member: Hello, May I speak with Mr. Williams, please?

Mr. Williams: This is Pete Williams.

Front Desk Team Member: Hello Mr. Williams, this is (Team member’s name) from (Dr.’s name office.) I was calling to confirm your appointment on (Date, day and time of appointment.) I also wanted to make sure that you received our welcome packet and new patient paperwork.
---
Mr. Williams: Yes, I’ll be at the appointment and I’ll bring the paperwork with me. (or “I didn’t receive the paperwork”)

Front Desk Team Member: Great, Mr. Williams. Our whole team is really looking forward to meeting you in person! Again, my name is (Team member’s name) and if you need anything before or during your appointment, please don’t hesitate to ask. See you (day and time)!

If they didn’t receive the NP Paperwork - double check that they have the correct email, and then go to Flex and re-send the paperwork to their email.

(Or Tell Them to come 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork)

MESSAGE LEFT:

Front Desk Team Member: Hello, this is (Team Member’s name) from (Dr.’s name office.) I was calling to confirm Mr. William’s appointment at our office on (Date, day, and time.) Please bring the new patient paperwork that was sent to you in the welcome packet. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call me at (office telephone number.) Our whole team looks forward to meeting you!

Change Appointment Script:

Front Desk Team Member: Hello, May I speak with Mr. Williams, please?

Mr. Williams: This is Pete Williams.

Front Desk Team Member: Hello Mr. Williams, this is (Team member’s name) from (Dr.’s name office.) I was calling because Dr. XXXX has had a change in his schedule and I was calling to see if you could help him out by coming in tomorrow at 4:00pm rather than….(time). If that would work, it would help us out soo much!
---
# Transfers of Trust

When a patient is ‘handed off’ from one team member to another, it is important to build up authority and positive goodwill towards the new person by building them up as a great team member as you introduce them to the patient and vice-versa. See below the examples of how to do this appropriately.

# How to connect with patients and make them feel at home:

- Ask Open-ended questions
- Most people enjoy talking about themselves because it is easy. Open ended questions generate conversation and encourage the patient to open up. Start by asking how their day is going, what they have planned for the weekend. If they start talking about a baseball game they are going to ask about it further - does their grandchild play? Is it their son? Is it the Saltdogs? Do they go to a lot of Saltdogs games? Add in something personal about yourself too, - “Oh I haven’t ever been to a Saltdogs game, I’ll have to go!”
- The more you talk to your patient, the more you’ll learn about them and connect. It will make their next visit that much more enjoyable!
- Practice Active Listening
- It’s easy to tune out as a patient is talking, but you’ll make a much stronger connection if you pay attention to them and engage. Ask relevant questions to keep the conversation going.
- Show Enthusiasm
- Small talk will come easy to some and is more challenging for others. Like anything, practice makes perfect. It is OK to have the same conversation with every patient you encounter. If that makes it easy and more manageable for you personally, do it!

# Transition from Reception Area to Treatment Room

This brief interaction is an important transition that most medical and dental offices overlook. It must become part of your practice’s culture that every patient is received like an old friend, with a smile and a warm greeting. This transition is especially important because the patient is getting their first glimpse at the back office team. The tone for the entire team-patient relationship can be guided by this initial impression.

The back office team member must take a quick pause and internally ask the following questions prior to calling the patient back to the treatment room:

1. How do I pronounce this patient’s name? (If unsure, verify with the front office team members)
2. Is this a new or existing patient? (Check the patient record to verify)
---
# 3. How should I address this patient?

(As a rule of thumb, our office addresses patients over 55 years old as Mr. or Ms.)

# How to execute Procedure:

After the back office team member has answered the questions above, he/she will go to the reception area to call the patient back to the treatment room. The team member should enter the reception area with a smile on his/her face. The team member should then call out the patient’s name. As the patient approaches the team member, the team member should wait until the patient is within arm’s reach and extend their arm to shake the patient’s hand.

# New Patient:

Back Office Team Member: Hello Ms. Jones! Welcome to the practice! My name is (team member’s name). I’ll be working with you today.

# Existing Patient:

Back Office Team Member: Hello Ms. Jones! It’s great to see you again. I’m going to take you back to the treatment area. Note: One subtle distinction. Team members should try to avoid turning their back to the patient. Rather than having the patient follow a team member who is walking ahead, it is much preferred to stand next to the patient and gesture with an open hand in the direction of the treatment room. The team member can then escort the patient to the treatment room by walking alongside the patient.

Back Office Team Member: Ms. Jones, we’re going to be going into room number three right this way.

# Seating the Patient in the Treatment Room

This is one of the most important steps in the entire new patient experience. The patient is finally in the chair and is evaluating every aspect of the office.

So far, the patient should have experienced exceptional service on the telephone while making the initial appointment. When they arrived at the front desk area they were greeted like an old friend. The back office team member warmly greeted them and escorted them back to the treatment room.

- Up until this point, each interaction was carefully guided, scripted and choreographed.
- This phase of the patient experience requires a bit more skill and personality. The team member must be able to have a conversation with the patient. The goal is to extract as much personal information from the patient as possible without making it feel like an inquisition.

It is at this phase of the patient experience that rapport is built and the foundation for a lifetime relationship begins.

Once the patient is seated in the chair, the back office team member should start to get to know the patient. They should NOT immediately begin talking about dentistry and what’s going to happen during the appointment. Each bit of information that we are able to gather from the patient allows the team to provide better service and care to the patient.
---
Creating an engaging conversation is an art and a skill that must be developed. Here are some quick pointers:

1. Get them to talk about themselves. Studies have shown that if you direct a conversation towards someone and get them talking about themselves, they will walk away from the conversation feeling better about you.
2. Ask open ended questions. Ask the type of questions that require more than a yes or no answer.
3. Genuinely listen. One of the greatest aspects of dentistry as a profession is getting to know so many people with diverse backgrounds and stories. Listen to what the patient’s have to say and develop a genuine care and interest in them. After all, we treat the whole person, not just the mouth! Here are some sample questions that our team members routinely ask new patients. As a rule of thumb, our assistants are required to record at least three questions for every new patient. As the patient returns for further treatment, the conversation can go back to what was spoken about and recorded at the previous appointment.

Back Office Team Member: So, tell me a little bit about yourself, how long have you lived here in this area?

- Are you going on any trips this (summer, spring, fall, winter)?
- Are you an animal person? Do you have any pets?
- Do you have children? Do they live in the area?
- What do you do for a living? How long have you been in that profession?
- What do you like to do in your spare time? Are you a (baseball, football, basketball, etc.) fan?
- Who’s your favorite team?

As rapport is being established, the back office team member should be preparing the treatment room for the full mouth series of x-rays. At this point, explain the procedure and let them know what to expect.

# New Patient Hygiene Scenario

After the hygienist has seated the patient in the chair and asked 3 personal questions, it is then time to start to discuss the actual procedures that you will perform today. Here is how we anticipate it going:

Back Office Team Member: Ms. Jones, today I’m going to take a series of x-rays of your entire mouth. There will be a total of eighteen x-rays taken. These x-rays will allow (Dr.’s name) to perform a complete examination of all of your teeth and surrounding structures. If you are worried about radiation exposure, our digital x-ray unit decreases your radiation exposure by over 80% compared to traditional X-rays.

When a patient is returning to the office for treatment, the back office team member should continue the conversation from the previous appointment. The back office team member should also take this opportunity to verify the treatment being done that day.

After x-rays are completed…

Back Office Team Member: Thanks so much for hanging in there with me on those x-rays. Luckily, we only take those every 3-5 years so we won’t have to worry about those for awhile. You did awesome with these today though!

Proceed with prophy.
---
After having all the procedure done, we then move into the next transfer of trust between a hygienist and the doctor.

# New Patient PFE Scenario

During a problem-focused exam, the patient will most likely have a lot of anxiety about what is going on with their mouth, and what it might cost or feel like to get the problem fixed. It is during this time that you really try to get to know the patient well for a minute or two before diving into the dental issues.

Back Office Team Member: Ms. Jones, I see here that you are experiencing pain/broken tooth in (area indicated over phone). Can you tell me a little more about that?

# Questions to answer before the doctor enters tx room:

- When did the pain start/when did this tooth break?
- Have you noticed any hot/cold sensitivity with this tooth?
- Is the pain (if any) sharp or more of a dull ache? Is the pain manageable with ibuprofen/tylenol? Is it constant or coming-going?
- Do you notice it more at night or in the morning? Has it been keeping you up at night?
- IF GUM RELATED- How much time has passed since your last cleaning?

After learning more about the symptoms obtain a PA and or IO picture of the tooth/area in question.

Back Office Team Member: Alright, now that I know a little bit more about what is going on, I am going to relay this information to (Dr.’s name) & have him take a look at the images we just took. (Dr.’s name) is amazing, and committed to giving you the best care possible! So, if you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don’t hesitate to let us know.

It then goes to the assistant to do a transfer of trust to the doctor.

# Returning Patient Scenario

Back Office Team Member: So Ms. Jones how was your cruise to Alaska?

Ms. Jones: We had a great time, thank you for asking! I can’t believe that you remembered that I was going on that trip.

Back Office Team Member: I’m glad you had a good time! Just to make sure we’re on the same page, it says that we’re doing a crown on a lower right tooth today. Does that sound right?

Ms. Jones: Yes, that sounds right.

Back Office Team Member: Great! (Dr.’s name) is here to take great care of you today. He will be in shortly and we’ll get started as long as you have no further questions.

# New Patient Introduction to the Doctor
---
Once the FMX for a comprehensive exam patient or the PA for the emergency patient has been taken, and the back office team member has had sufficient time to get to know the patient, the doctor should be called into the treatment room.

Prior to entering the treatment room, there should be a “hallway briefing,” between the back office team member and the doctor. During this briefing, the back office team member should inform the doctor of the patient’s chief complaint or reason for visiting the office, any significant medical history, and something personal about the patient.

# The briefing - Example

Back Office Team Member (NP): Doctor, in room #2 we have Mary Jones. Mrs. Jones is 67 years old. She is a new patient who is here for a comprehensive exam. She has no significant medical history. I have taken an FMX and she is ready for an exam. (Address any questions or concerns the pt had for the doctor)

Back Office Team Member (RETURNING): I have Mary back ready for (today’s TX). Topical is placed. We are ready for anesthetic. Mary just returned from an Alaskan cruise.

# Introduction of the Doctor to the patient

Back Office Team Member: Thank you for your patience. Mrs. Jones this is (Dr.’s name.) (Dr.’s name) this is Mrs. Jones.

Note: Since the back office assistant has established rapport with the patient, it is appropriate that he/she formally introduce the doctor. It’s always best to try to initiate a conversation between the doctor and the patient with a non-dental subject prior to diving into the exam. The back office team member can facilitate and move along the conversation by telling the doctor a bit about the patient in the presence of the patient.

This serves two purposes:

1. Demonstrates that the back office team member was genuinely listening to the patient, which further builds rapport.
2. Gives the doctor the abbreviated version of the “Yellow Sheet” and provides a good foundation for relationship building and trust.

# Here are some tips for the doctor’s initial conversation with the patient.

1. Follow the back office assistant’s cues in the hallway briefing and in the treatment room. Always try to make conversation regarding a non-dental subject prior to getting into the dental portion of the visit.
2. Try to turn the focus of the conversation back to the patient. Remember, the fastest way to build rapport is to listen and allow them to talk about themselves.
3. When presenting large treatment plans, always emphasize that the plan can be tackled in stages and in order of priority. A large treatment plan is almost always overwhelming to the patient and may scare them away if not presented with tact. Work with the patient to overcome ”sticker shock” by chunking the treatment plan down to manageable stages.

# Office Tour

When letting a new patient in the back for the first time, it’s important to create a ‘Fantastic Guest Experience’. One part of this is showing them a few amazing things about our office and how it’s different from other offices.

# This is how to do a New Patient Office Tour:

1. Welcome:
1. Open Door, call out first name
2. “Hi _______, my name is ******* and I’ll be helping you today.”
3. Close door behind them
4. “I don’t know if you saw it, but we do have an awesome espresso machine, water and sparkling water if you want some when you leave today.”
2. Tour
1. “In case you need it during today’s appointment, there’s a bathroom over here on the right, and when we’re done today you will check out at these desks here.”
2. Step around/in front of patient
3. “And here is a ‘State-of-the-Art’ 3-D Xray machine….this is some of the newest technology out there in dentistry.”
4. “We will be heading down to the 3rd room on the left here”
3. Room
1. Enter room through wider doorway, allow patient to sit down
2. Take jacket from them or drink
3. Review procedure:
1. “So today we have blocked out 1 hour for the two fillings we have planned, is there a specific time you need to be out of here by?”
4. Experience:
1. “So we do a few things special here to create a more relaxing dental experience.”
2. We have relaxing music playing, a video screen overhead playing a really neat video, and once we tip you back we will dim the bright lights overhead to reduce stress on your eyes.
3. And, many of our patients love the laughing gas for $5- we try to keep it very reasonable because people love it soo much. If you want to try it at any time, let us know and we can do it for you!
5. “Ok, we will get started now….”

# Marketing and Patient Acquisition

In any practice new patients are the life-blood of any practice. There are many ways to get this right, and even more ways to get this wrong. Marketing is not about spending a large amount of money on radio advertising, however that might be a piece of it. It is also not about plastering billboards around the city, although sometimes they work well.

Watch the video introduction to this section on Marketing & Patient Acquisition →

Below are a few of the important documents that you should use as guides to help you in your quest to systemize the marketing and patient acquisition. While not an exhaustive list of all options and documents, this will jumpstart your capability to create marketing and track the return for your office.

1. Referral Thank You System
1. One of the best ways to encourage more internal referrals is to send ‘Thank You’ Cards to patients who refer to you, and to new patients. Here is a system with verbiage to send to those patients.
2. Photo / Video Release
1. It is always a good idea to take many pictures of team members and patients to post to social media to show how you are connected to the community. Use this photo release prior to posting any pictures of patients to make sure that you are reducing your risk of a patient being angry or getting litigious around a photo.
3. Brand Book
---
a. When you do all your marketing efforts, it is imperative to have all the colors, logos, and branding done in the same fashion. If any of your marketing is off-color, or uses a different brand, it can decrease the effectiveness and give possible patients the sense that you don’t know what you’re doing. This brand book is built on the idea that anytime you have any marketing done, here are the ‘rules’ of the brand. It contains exact colors, fonts, and logo options to be used in each circumstance.

# 4. Marketing Tracker

a. We built this simple marketing tracker years ago to measure the ROI for each of the multiple practices in each of our groups. If you have a marketing coordinator, or someone’s job is to track the marketing, use this sheet to simplify the plan and see the spending on the practice each month.

# 5. Internal Marketing Strategies

a. This document is a simplified summary of all the internal marketing opportunities you might want to test in your practice. This includes cards for patients, wine, cups, and other ideas that might help expand your brand internally. What we most often see is that happier patients spend more money internally with your practice. So remember that it isn’t ALL about new patients, sometimes it is about improving the per-patient spend at the practice.

# 6. Amazon Product Links

a. This document was created so that we could send patients our favorite products and have them buy these products, but that we wouldn’t have to carry them as inventory in our office. For some things, we like to sell these products in the office and possibly get a decent profit margin on them, but for others, they are not worth the effort. Use this document to create an Amazon List of items that you recommend, and then link these to your website to gain traffic and SEO value.

# Internal Marketing Strategies

The best marketing is probably marketing to your own patients, and a side benefit is it is usually the cheapest and most effective. The people that walk through your door already know you, like you, and keep coming back. It is best to capitalize on that respect and hope to multiply that to their friends. So here’s what I do, along with the help of my marketing company, myCMOshare Monthly Analytics and Design. If you have questions about sourcing products, cards, etc...reach out to them at mycmoshare.com.

Thanks to Marketing expert Ryan Gross for sharing all these ideas. To connect with him, check out www.myCMOshare.com. Also a shout out to Dr. Justin Nichols for sharing the awesome idea of a customized gift bag.

First of all, you should have a Brand Book- see the previous documents for that.

# 1. Patient Experience:

# a. Must be Amazing

i. Obviously you must have a great patient experience from beginning to end. A lot of that starts from becoming human. Go with real personal interaction, CARE about your patients, and just work on connecting with people at a deeper level. If you do that, no matter how you execute it, you will generate patients who think you are amazing...and that’s where it starts.

# b. Scripts for phone

i. There are only a few categories where most callers fall into...work to develop scripts that follow all those. This should be in your operations manual.

# c. Transfer of Trust scripts

i. In each section of the patient experience, you should have a transfer of trust. This should be a script where you edify who you’re handing off to. This should also be in your operations manual.

# d. Texting/Voicemails after difficult procedures (Implants, Endo, Extractions, Sedation)

i. After a difficult procedure, the doctor or staff should text or call patients who had a particularly difficult procedure. This means a lot to patients and is highly recommended. If you don’t want patients to have your direct cell phone number, you can always get a Google phone # to use for patient-only contact.

ii. Set up Flex or Modento to text/email/voicemail after these appointments.

# e. Continuity of Brand In-Office

i. Internal Office Paperwork
---
# f. Brochures and items that are custom branded do your office.

These could include brochures on extractions, implants, sleep apnea, caries risk, periodontal risk. Examples are shown:

# g. Business Cards/Reappointment Cards

# i. Custom Business cards are commonplace nowadays.

Remember that the quality of card is directly tied to the quality of perceived care they will receive in your office. Do not go cheap on these, splurge for the higher quality card, higher feel, heavier paper, etc. Also make sure they look amazing and do not have pixelated images or poor quality printing.

# h. Patient Giveaways:

# i. Tshirts

# 1. In our office we give away t-shirts randomly.

We design t-shirts every few months that have neat images on them for the season.
---
almost considered a collectible item because of the changing colors and such. Staff love them, and when given out, they are rolled up, tied with a bow, and with a card. (About $6.50 per t-shirt is the cost.) It is more expensive than other options, but they also become walking billboards for you.

# i. Wine

We go to Trader Joes or other stores and buy cheaper bottles of wine. Usually $3.50 or less per bottle, and then wrap them in a clear plastic bag from Amazon.com, and put a nice sticker on the bottle, and tie up with a bow. We give out about 1 bottle per employee per day. It’s part of their checklist to give one out to anyone they want. Very random, just pick a favorite patient that the staff member connected with.

# j. Steel-insulated Cups

Go to Alibaba.com to purchase, or else use my contact at this company: They are about $4.50 for a 20 oz. mug that is EXACTLY the same as Hydroflask. (They are prohibited from printing Hydroflask on the bottle)

Jason Pan - Sales Manager- ZheJiang Skirton Industrial Co.,Ltd Jason@zjskirton.com

# k. Gift Baggies

This idea is from Dr. Justin Nichols of California. He runs a high-end implant practice and develops lots of referrals internally. He had this bag created to encourage reciprocity.

273
---
# Google/Facebook Reviews:

# Swell CX- a must needed addition to get more google reviews

# Giveaways

- Buy a YETI Cooler and put somewhere in the office with a sign that each month or two you will give it away to someone who writes a google review

# Email Batching to patients

- Pull all Emails from the past 6 months, send them emails (Usually 40-50 a day to not get put into a spam-mode on the account and get locked). These emails should thank them for being a patient, and remind them how important google reviews are to your business.

# Cards to Patients:

- New Patients
- Custom printed cards with a generic message where you can write any message. Must be high quality card-stock

Dear (patient),

Thank you soo much for referring a friend to our clinic recently. It means a lot that you trust us with your care, and in turn tell other people about us. We appreciate it and want you to grab a coffee or smoothie on us today. Enjoy the gift card!

Thanks,
Dr. XXXXX
---
# Special Occasions

Same card as above, but the idea is that when something is happening in a patient’s life, have the staff write a ‘Hello, Friend’ card. The idea is that it just says “Hello, We’re thinking of you”. It could be a difficult time, it could be a celebration. Anything...people like getting a card...and if it’s from their dentist or hygienist...it’s that much more special. No gift in this card, just a message.

275
---
# Amazon Product Lists

- Go to your Amazon Account (Might be best to use your Business Account so that it has Business Name)
- Find a product, then say Add to a list
- Make Sure you add all applicable lists that you might want, for us it was:
- a. Dental Essentials
- b. Dental Implants
- c. Denture Care
- d. Invisalign/Braces
- e. Mouthguards
- f. Sensitive Teeth
- g. Teeth Whitening
- Then, keep adding certain products to those lists
- You can find and organize your lists here:
---
And then you can organize your lists by hierarchy here:

Then to share the list, go here:

277
---
Then have your web-developer add these links into your website

1. While you won’t get sales revenues from these products, it’s a great service and might actually help SEO because of increased traffic to your site, and ease of use
2. Send an email like this:

278
---
Once your web developer has those links, they can create a page on your website that looks like this:

After clicking the link from the home page, it will appear like this:

Save that URL and have it in your Flex post-op forms or ready to be copied and pasted into texts to send to patients after their appointments!

Send them to the website, to then choose the lists that are linked, then you get added Website traffic which Google will see and subsequently increase SEO value

# Overhead and Business Operations

One of the most overlooked aspects of owning a dental practice is actually looking at the numbers each day, week, and month. It is of great importance that dentists take these numbers seriously as it can mean the difference between retiring at the age of 55, 65, or 85.

Watch the video introduction to this section on Overhead and Business Operations →

Below is a summary of the documents and resources in this section.

Before we get into each document, we wanted to give you a few key points.

First is that there is an almost unlimited amount of information out there about practice management. Sometimes it can get into the weeds pretty quickly. We urge you to focus on the big picture, and maintain good habits so that you can pull on the biggest levers to improve your practice.

The other is that the cadence of tracking is extremely important. In order to be appropriately reactive, it is important to get a good Profit and Loss Statement quickly after the end of the month. You should expect to get this back from your accountant or bookkeeper about 10-14 days after the end of each month. It is important that you have someone do this for you, or you do it yourself, each month. Quarterly P&L are not acceptable if you want to run your business at a high level.

You then use this as the basis for other documents

1. Cost per Procedure
1. This is an exercise that you should do to figure out the exact cost for you to produce a specific procedure. This includes all the office overhead in the procedure as well.
---
# 2. Budget + Gameplan.

This is a higher level document for dentists who want to plan their next year and shoot for specific targets in their overhead percentage. This spreadsheet is made up of 3 pages, first being the game plan. This is where you put your targeted percentages and income, and see what you hope will be the final profitability of the practice. Next is the ‘Actual’, where you put the real numbers after they get tabulated. These actual numbers are taken from your Profit and Loss statement. Then finally, the comparison sheet is where you choose the month and it automatically calculates whether you achieved the desired percentages in each section. This Gameplan should be completed in November or December of the year, to be ready for the next year to start with a plan.

# 3. Loan tracking spreadsheet

This is an awesome tool to track in real time what your debt picture looks like from your business accounts as well as personal liabilities. In the spreadsheet, you can put in each Guarantor, loan amount, and timeline, and it will help you keep track of your debts as you pay them down over time.

# 4. Profit First System

Mike Michaelowicz wrote the book Profit First, and here is our take on the system for the dental office. The Profit First system is widely used by the members of Dental Success Network, and it is helpful in making sure that each month the dental office gives the owner the appropriate amount of money for profit, taxes, debt, operations, and doctor pay. See the flow chart to help decide how you want to run your profit first accounting system, and read the book for the full picture.

# 5. Divergent Dental Reports

Next are the reports from Divergent Dental (Divergentdental.com). This service ties into OpenDental and pulls out the executive-level data that you need every day, week, and month to make good decisions. With this information, you can then see how your business is tracking, however it doesn’t include actual financial information about your spending. We do not recommend using a service that has a separate web-based dashboard because we have found that after about 3 months, most dentists and teams stop looking at the dashboard.

# 6. Custom Practice Analytics

Created by Jake Conway, the Financial Analyst for the Dental Success Institute, these reports are amazing. They combine your Dental software numbers, payroll numbers, expenses and balance sheet to take a symptom-cause-solution approach to highlight areas of opportunity within a dental practice.

# 7. Embezzlement Avoidance Guidance

Embezzlement can happen to even the most watchful owners. However, we would like to think we can avoid a whole lot of those scenarios with a few tactics which are shared in this document.

# Loan Tracking Spreadsheet

On this spreadsheet there are a few keys:

1. Get the paperwork for each loan you have for any business/personal entities
2. Start at Loan A
3. Place the Entity, Lendor, Loan Title, Term, Rate, and any other information
4. Make sure to put the monthly payments in the column as hard-coded
5. If the interest doesn't accrue correctly, you may have to type that amount in each month as well (Some banks do daily interest - which is hard to replicate)
6. Go through steps 2-5 for each loan
7. In Summary Cell L2 - pick the matching correct number for the month
8. Zero out any unused sheets

Sheet should be usable at this point

Going forward, any month that you pay additional - put that added principle payment in the column on that loan

# Profit First System

Watch the webinar on the Dental Success Network about the Profit First system with Dr. Chris Green and the Authors →

The chart above gives a good summary of how the money flows in the profit first system. A few keys about the system:

- Each green box is a separate bank account, we encourage 6-7 accounts (Emergency Fund is one we like to have per our own thinking)
- On the 1st and 15th of the month, money is taken from the Income account, and split into the other accounts according to the percentage named in the plan document which you will create for yourself.
- Do not start at too low an operational budget (or too high a profit), this is a recipe for pain and suffering which is not needed. Start with a budget that is in line with your historical trends, and then start to squeeze it from there.

● This chart shows 30% for doctor pay, although this is only if you are paying associates and in those cases you should match the associate pay percentage to that box. You as the owner will also need to take W-2 pay out of that account, so in cases where it is just a 1 doctor office, that account can be less of a percentage.

● The Operational account is what we commonly refer to as your ‘Overhead’. This includes all payroll, rent, office expenses, and other costs. When we say that we encourage offices to get to ‘Black Belt’ Status, that means that this operational account is running at 50% or less of total revenues.

● The third part is the 15% box- which would normally be called ‘Profit’, but we need to remember that debt and taxes are paid out of profit. In the case where you have no debt, then you can delete that debt box, but you must always save at least 40% of that account for taxes for when your taxes come due on those profits.

● The doctor pay box of 30% assumes that you will be paying yourself W-2 wages out of that, and so taxes are already paid on that money. No need to save more taxes than that.

We hope the Profit First system helps you achieve the overhead percentage and belt status you’re looking for. For more information, check out the book by Mike Michaelowicz called Profit First.

# Embezzlement Avoidance Guidance

- Balance individual office everyday - cash in should match cash out
- Payments made within other offices as well if you have multiple
- CC payments - double check between OD and PayConnect
- CareCredit checked at end of the month - match electronic payments with CareCredit website
- Checks all given to central office and accounted for daily on deposit sheets
- Potentially check paid at one office is counted towards other office
- Potentially scan and email all checks to central office
- Bank account - accounted for every transaction
- Need to lock out certain functions in your practice management software

# Areas to watch for:

# Adjustment Transactions

Query tracked all adjustments - by date entered, date of treatment, date applied, by user

Making multiple discount entries... room for error... if a patient is a cash patient... seen for hygiene and doctor... making 2 different entries... some adjusted off doc, some off office

# General:

- Be involved, pay attention. Look for suspicious activity. Set a good example.
- Create a climate of accountability.
- Prosecure if you are embezzled. Prevent this person from moving on to another office.
- Listen carefully to patient complaints.

# Day to Day Operations:

- Separate duties - no one person should handle both payments and bank deposits.
- Learn your software management system.
---
# Financial Management

- Run a daily schedule and check it against all payments and charges.
- Do daily audits - look at every check, EOB, and patient visit.
- Review every posted transaction on the day sheet.
- Run a check register daily and compare it to the daily deposit slip.
- Have the doctor make all bank deposits.
- Maintain a small amount of petty cash and a good tracking system.
- Make sure all patients are billed.

# Employee Management

- Make all employees accountable; let them know you’re watching.
- Do a full background check on every employee - disclose that you will do this on the employment application form.
- Require employees to take time off and to cross-train.

# Financial Management

- Have an outside accounting firm do the check reconciliation if you do not wish to do it yourself.
- Mail bank statements directly to the doctor’s home or accounting firm – not to the practice!
- Pay close attention to the practice’s finances and do not turn control totally over to staff.
- Pay your own bills, after carefully reviewing each item.
- Utilize Quicken or other financial software programs to track office finances and create an audit trail.

# Checklist to be completed for Cash Flow and Overhead Control:

- ☐ We are aware of the profession’s ideal expense percentages and understand that elevated expenses in any category decrease the owner’s profit.
- ☐ We focus on profitability as our number one KPI secondary to productions, collections, and new patients.
- ☐ We understand that debt is acceptable if it is leveraged to create more profit, not just more revenue. We also understand that incurring debt to purchase depreciating assets that do not generate a profitable ROI will decrease the owner’s net worth and cash flow.
- ☐ We set hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, adjusted production, collections, new patients and profitability benchmarks.
- ☐ We track our KPI’s from month to month and year to year.

That brings us to the end of the Dental Success Network’s Operations Manual. We hope that you have enjoyed the resources available in this book, as well as the strategies employed by some of the best and brightest that we have interacted with inside the Dental Success Network.

While we have done our best to give credit to all the authors and contributors, we know that information has been shared and re-shared over the years on DSN, and it is difficult to give credit where it is due. If you feel that you helped create any of these resources or precursors to these documents, please let us know so that we can give you credit.

# Final Thoughts:

Becoming a systemized practice isn’t something that is done overnight, or done in a week. We know, through working with many hundreds of practices, that systemization is a process. The practice owners who do things well, like many who contributed to this book, are ALWAYS working on systems to improve their practice. They take notes each time someone asks them a question because they know that some questions mean a system might need to be improved. While creating a system can be a lot of work and might seem stifling to team members, the best Black Belt dentists know that creating and improving systems actually leads to building up more leaders in the company. These leaders help grow the organization and help create great companies. We hope that this book helps you in your quest to become a Black Belt practice, and we hope you connect with us if you need any help!
