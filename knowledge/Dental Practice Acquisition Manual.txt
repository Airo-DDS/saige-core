# How to Use the Dental Acquisition Manual

Welcome to The Dental Acquisition Manual! This book is a compilation of our 'in the trenches' experiences combined with many of the top resources we have developed to help dentists as they prepare to make one of the biggest purchases of their life. We wrote this book to encapsulate some of the information that we have learned over the course of owning and managing 25 dental clinics (as of the time of this writing).

It is important to note that we have not always had it all 'figured out'. We have made too many mistakes to count; some have even cost us months of frustration and thousands of dollars. However, through these experiences and in a decade of coaching more than a thousand dentists, we believe that we have learned the best and most economical way to acquire a dental practice.

This book is just a part of our plan to help dentists. As Co-Founders of the Dental Success Network, our mission is to help improve the lives of dentists and dental professionals. That is what we have the privilege of doing every day. Inside the Dental Success Network, we strive to make dentists' lives better with three primary areas: by saving them money; by teaching them new skills; and by connecting them with colleagues in a positive, collaborative environment.

As you go through this book, you will find several instances where we have provided access to a customizable, downloadable document. In these instances, simply scan the QR code, sign up for a Free Trial, and then the QR code will take you to the link to download the resources that are paired with this book.

# Setting the Vision

When considering the next stage of their dental career; we have found that dentists are attracted to practice ownership for countless reasons. Some are looking for a fresh start in a new city or location; some wish to leave an associateship that no longer fulfills them; and some wish to acquire something that they can call their own and begin building an asset that will eventually bring them income, financial stability and equity:

Perhaps you considered doing a startup and decided that it wasn't the path for you: Startups can be challenging, and they're not always the right fit for everyone. Sometimes there are no openings in the market to do a good startup from either a space perspective or a demographics perspective. This could be that the ratio of dentists to patients is too competitive, or that there are not any good real estate opportunities for a new dental office.

There are, however, great opportunities when dentists, who are late in their career, prepare to transition their practices over to a new generation. When handled correctly, these opportunities allow the acquiring doctor to take over an established practice, mold it according to their own vision and preferences, and pay the selling doctor a fair price for it. This scenario is the ultimate win-win.

However, let's not fool ourselves into thinking an acquisition is easier than a startup. Complicated mitigating factors can make it very difficult to properly execute a transition. There are checklists that need to be completed at every stage. There could be existing staff that might not possess your same values or clinical standards. You could pay an average price for equipment that will break the day after you purchase the practice. While acquisitions can be more financially stable in the early stages of ownership in comparison to startups, they come with their own unique challenges.

Whether an acquisition is the right avenue for your specific situation and personality; we have found it valuable to create a pros and cons list. Here is ours:
---
# Pros and Cons of Acquisition

# Pros:

- Existing team
- Existing patient base
- Existing revenue stream
- Easier to start - no construction
- Practice the dentistry YOU want to practice maybe not initially; but this can occur quickly
- Financial benefits of ownership
- You are the boss and have complete control
- Ability to help staff grow and realize potential

# Cons:

- Security in choosing own future
- Medium-large debt load
- Moderate revenue to start
- Potentially low new patient flow
- Existing team might not possess the same values
- Existing team may not be clinically proficient
- Diagnosing inconsistencies between new and previous owner
- Previous owner and new owner styles/history/persona don't match and patients may leave due to change
- Potentially fixing inadequate or failed dentistry

As you consider all the details of an acquisition, you should remember that although the debt on an acquisition might be higher; the revenues from the first day are usually good enough to cover the cost. The graph shows the startup revenues at the bottom, but the acquisition revenues at the higher line.

This instant revenue stream is usually what leads people to choose an acquisition over a startup. While this can give you more peace of mind, remember to weigh the factors listed above to see which avenue is going to better match your end goals.

It is very possible that you're not sure what your 'end goals' might be. That is totally normal, and something we do not often consider until someone sits us down and makes us write it down. We do that almost yearly in the Dental Success Institute's Elite Practice Mastermind, and so we've listed the exercise below to complete at your own pace. Take about 15 minutes and complete the exercise below:
---
# Ideal Practice Exercise

The second habit from Dr. Stephen Covey's groundbreaking book, *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, is "Begin with the end in mind." Dr. Covey advised that in order to have the greatest likelihood of achieving your desired result, it is important to be able to envision what your ideal outcome looks like, and to put a plan together to achieve your ultimate goal.

Building a successful practice, whether it is a start-up or an acquisition, is no different. Having a clean vision from the beginning of what you want the practice to eventually look like "when it's done" can be one of the most powerful and clarifying exercises that a dentist can perform prior to ownership.

In order to aid with the visualization process, and to help gain a clear visual picture of your ideal dental practice, we have developed the exercise below: Now is the time to allow yourself to dream without practicality and limitations.

At this point, you might be leaning towards keeping this goal 'realistic.' We want to pre-emptively warn against that: Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor whose private journal became the book called *Meditations*, wrote:

"Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach."

Remember, every owner of a dental practice, no matter how large architecturally or visually appealing, or successful, started off right where you are right now: If they were able to build their ideal practice, so can you!

# Step

Start by answering the following questions in as much detail as possible:

- Where do you want to live?
- What type of patients do you serve (Fee for Service, PPO, Medicaid, etc.)?
- How many practices are in your perfect business?
- What's the size of the facility of the business in square feet?
- How many operatories?
- How is it decorated?
- What 'feel' does the office exude when you walk in?
- What brands or stores does your dental practice mimic or remind your guests of?
- What colors and materials will be the main look of the practice?
- How is it unique from the competition?
---
# How many dental (dentist) associates (if any):

# How many people are on your team:

# What is the annual production and collections:

# What is your personal production per month:

# What is the overhead and profitability percentage:

# How many clinical hours do you work per week:

# How many CEO hours do you work per week:

# How many weeks do you take off per year:

# What is your personal take home income:

# Does your practice bring you peace of mind, fulfillment; freedom and joy:

# How old are you when you sell the practice and retire:

# How will you spend your days during retirement:

# The purpose of owning my practice is to:

# My business will allow me to:

# Will build this practice so that can:

# This practice will give me the ability to:

# What skills will need to improve on:

# What habits do need to remove from my life:

# Lastly; What type of owner/dentist/leader do need to become to achieve the goals set forth above?

# Step 2

Take the answers to these questions and write out your ideal practice vision statement in paragraph form.

Example: On June 14, 2034, at the age of 60 years old, I will transition out of my dental business by selling my group of practices to four dentists who were previously associates and later became minority partners. When the business sells it will have a total of three affiliated dental practices producing $7M with no debt. The EBITDA will be 20% and the practice group received a 6X valuation: The sales price will be $8.4M. As an 80% owner of the entire group, I will receive a pre-tax check of $6.72M.

# Included in your Ideal Practice Vision Statement

- Your Age when "It's Done" and you're ready to transition
- The transaction value of the business and your take home pre/post tax
- Exactly what the practice looks like: physical size, decor, location, team, to the type of services rendered, purchaser.
- Your overall health, your relationships, your mental health (4 Futures Score)
- Plan for what to do with your days
- What's your next chapter?
---
# Step

Create benchmarks with exact dates and specifics that lead to the eventual end goal.

|Financial|Physical Location|Other|
|---|---|---|
|Age 30| | |
|Age 40| | |
|Age 50| | |
|Age 60| | |

# Step

Review your Ideal Practice Vision Statement; Benchmarks and Timelines each month from now until your ultimate deadline.

# Chapter 2

# Finding Acquisitions

The next stage of the acquisitions process is to begin identifying possible practices within your desired area that meet your specifications. Once preliminary screenings have been done, you can begin submitting offers. Depending on the location, there may be multiple offices that fit your budget and preferred practice style.

Prior to looking for the right opportunity, it is best to figure out where you want to live and whether that area has favorable demographics. Even though you will already be purchasing an existing patient base, it is always wise to make sure the general area is not saturated with too many dentists. In areas of over-saturation, you might buy a practice that remains stagnant for many years as you work to grow against external forces that limit potential growth opportunities.

One issue we have seen sometimes is that an acquisition opportunity becomes available, and due to ancillary factors, our minds trick us into thinking that this is 'the one'. Sometimes we jump 10 places ahead and skip the due diligence process in favor of our 'gut feeling'. This can be a disastrous mistake, which could cost you many hundreds of thousands of dollars, and decades of struggle. We encourage, no matter where you are in the process, to go through the steps listed here to ensure that you buy a practice that will lead to long-term growth.

While the next few steps are listed out in this order (1. Demographics, 2. Traffic Numbers, 3. Finding Acquisition offices), this is not always the order that the process occurs. You may find an opportunity in an area where you were not looking, but the opportunity looks solid. However you approach it, these three steps can be interchangeable, or completed concurrently:

# Demographics of Target Areas

Once you have narrowed down your areas of interest to a few different zip codes and neighborhoods, you will need to run demographic reports on each of them: Taking time to do this step will verify and confirm the strength or weakness of your target areas. There can be very significant differences between areas that are relatively close to one another and selecting the
---
one that is right for you could potentially be the difference between a wildly successful practice and one that perpetually struggles.

In the first chapter; you have already begun to identify the type of practice you will eventually want in the future. However; revisiting this shorter list will be helpful when comparing it to the demographics you are looking for:

Below is a list of points to consider:

- Will you be in network with insurances? Or will you maintain 'out of network' status?
- What sort of procedures will you perform?

You might be able to find acquisitions that match this profile, and you might not. Have no fear! You can always buy a practice that does one type of dentistry, and gradually change it over to a more comprehensive model. The previous doctor could have been doing all the surgery, and if that is not your passion, you can switch it over to focus on sleep apnea and orthodontics - the possibilities are vast. (Remember; sometimes you will pay a premium for certain practices that add in specialty procedures. If you do not perform some of these procedures, you might be paying for a model that you cannot replicate.)

Your next step is to identify your ideal patient. If you're trending towards wisdom teeth extractions and traditional braces, then you will know that your target demographic is probably younger and proximity to a high school might be a good idea. If your preferred clinical suite includes dentures or all-on-X prosthetics, your ideal demographic might skew towards an older population:

While searching zip codes and cities for your acquisition targets, it's important to ensure that your ideal patient demographic is at the forefront of your mind when evaluating each area. Remember that sometimes a zip code will have great demographics from a national scale, but fail to match the demographic appropriate for the type of dentistry that you want to practice. This inconsistency may lead to more struggle and less long term success.

Once you have your ideal patient demographics, the next step is to start evaluating potential zip codes and areas in the city where you want to live for more detailed demographics and dental competition. Remember that a dentist will generally pull a high density of patients from about a 1 to 3 mile radius range. That small circle around your future practice is where it is the most important to have favorable demographics.
---
mile range, but that radius is less relevant: These radii also matter more in densely populated areas, where people might not be apt to drive as far: However; in rural spots we tend to see patients drive many more miles to go to the dentist: If you are going to a rural spot like Wahoo, Nebraska (real place), you will see patients drive 30 miles from adjacent counties to visit a dentist in their closest large town.

We used to run a couple different sets of software to help us decide traffic and demographics. Fortunately now, they have all been rolled into one software, ArcGIS. Below are the instructions to help you run demographics:

1. Visit Learn ArcGIS to create an account for a free 60-day trial.
2. Sign up for an account; an email will be sent with your Username info and prompt to create a password.
3. Once signed into the Learn ArcGIS website, click on the app icon that appears next to your name in the upper right hand corner.
4. Select the Business Analyst app.

After you have accessed the 'Business Analyst' app, click 'Create New Project', give your project a name, then click the 'Create' button.
---
After a brief load, you are able to open your new project and will be taken to a map: To create your first site, type in an address in the search bar at the top-right to place a pin at that location:

From the menu above your new pin, click 'Create site' and define the boundaries you want to use for your analysis, e.g: mileage rings, drive time, or walk time. After clicking apply, you will see your site as well as the boundaries you just created.

|Rings|Drive time|Walk time|
|---|---|---|
|Radius|in miles| |
|Ucc bandt| | |
|Apply|Apply|Apply|

Now that you have created your first site you are able to view reports, infographics, and comparisons for data within that area. You can select these options by clicking on 'Reports' on the toolbar at the top of the page. From the reports screen, click 'Run Reports' in the toolbar to view infographic or classic reports, or click 'Comparison Reports' to compare data from your selected site with data from the same ZIP code, county, state, country or even another created site.

Let's start by running a classic report: from the 'Reports' tab click 'Run Reports' and then 'Run Classic Reports'. Make sure that the site you just created is selected at the top. Now you can choose any one or multiple reports to run from the list below by clicking the checkbox next to each one you want to run: Hover your cursor over the @0 to view a summary of the report's contents and click the magnifying glass icon to see a sample version of that report.

# Esri reports

# 2010 Census Profile

# ACS Housing Summary

# ACS Key Population Household Facts

You will see all of the reports you have selected in the box on the right: From there, you can choose whether you want to download each report as a PDF, an Excel file, or both.

# Traffic Numbers

While the demographic statistics can greatly impact the success of your practice, the next largest factor is visibility of your practice. Of course you can be in the middle of New York City with a million people in a 3 mile radius, but if no one can see your practice, it will be challenging to achieve success.

So the next most important factor is visibility traffic numbers in the zip code and along major routes along an area: We all know that major corporate dental chains prefer to have high visibility spots. They will pay anywhere between $35-45 Sq. Ft. for lease space each year; and then pay all real estate insurances, property taxes and utilities on top of that!

Remember: As you start to see the traffic numbers in an area, pay attention to which dental offices might have street-frontage visibility: Take note of any that might be for sale or possible acquisition targets. We will address this later; but remember that a practice might be for sale, but the doctor might be keeping it so quiet and confidential that you will not know it is on the market.

Judging the traffic flow; it is important to judge how this metric affects our advertising budget, as well as our facility budget.

The best software for traffic analysis is also ArcGIS. ArcGIS will give you the traffic counts in specific spots along your roadways at different points in time over the past few years. Once you find a city or part of a city that you want a closer look at; the maps will give you a good idea of the traffic and visibility to expect from any office you may purchase.

With all of the traffic reports and use them in your evaluation analysis to know exact traffic counts and to make sure you're going to the visibility you want in any acquisition:

# Dental Competition

Now that you have the data for your patient demographics and the traffic patterns in your city; you will want to evaluate the number of dentists and type of dentistry being performed around your target zip codes.

It would be overly simplistic to assume that all dentists are doing the same procedures and in the same manner: Most dentists do varying procedures, have different marketing strategies, and have different target demographics.

To illustrate this point; we will use the restaurant business as an example. Applebees is called a 'Mid-market American-Style Restaurant' by the National Restaurant Association. When they do site research, they really only care about competition with similar 'Mid-market American Style Restaurants'. If there is a Dairy Queen next door to a potential site, they really don't need to worry: Dairy Queen focuses on walk-up and drive through traffic. Dairy Queen's price point is $3-8 a plate, whereas Applebees is $9-23 a plate. So, although they both sell food, they really have no competition between each other.

The same might be true for your new location: A dentist down the street that has been there for 30 years and is trapped in an older medical building might not be the competition that would affect your new startup or acquisition.
---
# To evaluate the competitive landscape, you need to:

# Evaluate your competition for your targeted demographic

- Use Google Maps/My Maps
- Create a new map
- Add in locations for other dentists
- Get a visual representation of competition
- Count and Add into your spreadsheet

Once you've located all the dentists within an area around your potential acquisition, categorize these patients into groups. Remember that any of these offices could potentially be a target for you to acquire, so take note of the potential age of each doctor who owns the office. While age is not the only factor; it is usually the most common factor that leads to the sale of an office. Also remember that some doctors are not the actual owner of the business, and that age is not always the reason for a sale. For these reasons, do not rule out dentists who are younger or do not look like the typical seller:

# Create three different subsets of dental practices

1. Dentists like you
2. Dentists who do not compete with you
3. DSO Corporate

# Remember to evaluate along these competitive points:

- PPO's vs. FFS
- What are their marketing styles?
- What are their hours?
- Do they have a decent website?
- Do they offer similar services as you will

Remember: your only competition are those dentists in your 'group'.

It is also important to consider future demographics into the quality analysis of a site. While the current demographics might be very good, the future demographics might be even better and may be a sound reason to be more aggressive in a certain situation. On the flip side, the current demographics of an office might be good currently; but if there are major changes coming, the office might not be in a good situation in the future. We are reminded of one situation where an acquisition happened, only to find that a large low-income housing development occurred across the street immediately after the sale. This office then stagnated for years with less-than-ideal patients.
---
To look at future numbers, check with your local planning commission or municipality about plans for future roadways, zoning, or new subdivisions. Here's a few key points to ask about:

- Will future construction be zoned commercial or residential?
- Even with commercial construction, will it be for 'Big Box' construction like Wal-mart or smaller commercial strip malls?
- Will there be any major roadway construction that will block visibility or access to my site?
- Will there be any major roadway construction in the next few years that will restrict, even temporarily, access to my site?
- Are there any tax credits available to build in certain areas?

# Looking for Acquisitions

As stated earlier, acquisitions in the dental market can be difficult to find. Due to the complex social factors based around the doctor-patient relationship, many dentists wish to keep the sale of their practice confidential. They fear, and rightfully so, that if word got out publicly that they were selling, the value of their practice would go down and patients would exit the practice before a new doctor/owner took over. Additionally, they are concerned that staff would potentially leave if word of a practice sale was made. Because of this, the seller will often tell only a few people and keep certain specifics very opaque about their location, not mention the size of the patient base, or hide other distinguishing factors. However, typically there are a few places that are good to look for potential acquisitions:

1. Publications like ADA News, Local Dental Journals
2. Dental Supply Representatives: Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco
3. Word of Mouth from Colleagues and Specialists
4. Local Accountants, Bankers, and Attorneys
5. Dental Transition Companies (National or Local representatives)
6. Alumni Network at local Dental Schools

As you start looking for a potential acquisition, you can look in all of the above places. Hopefully, you will find a target, or actually a few targets, that have potential. However, if you are not finding anything promising, then you can always employ the last tactic, which is a direct letter to potential dentists in an area.

If you've taken the steps earlier in this chapter, then you have already surveyed the demographics of an area through competitive analysis. This means you should already have a list of addresses of dentists in an area. However, sometimes there may be more practices for sale than you may be able to find or know about. To look for all available options, we also recommend that you send out a personal letter to all potential targets within a zip code. You might be inclined to only look for the 'prime' practices that have good visibility, but we encourage you to NOT leave any stone unturned. There could be low-performing practices that...

are for sale that might be good acquisition-merger opportunities. Finding these are harder; but if you can buy and merge two practices together at a good price-point, then you will significantly decrease the time frame of an acquisition and increase the trajectory of your growth.

# Example Letter for Targeting Unknown Acquisitions

Example Doctor; DDS

Address

City, STATE 00000

(Fun/personal picture of yourself/family here)

Dear Doctor;

My name is ________ and I am a local doctor who has lived in ________ for the past XX Years with my family: (More fluff here.)

I am writing this letter in search of a practice purchase or transition opportunity with you. I currently practice in the XXXXXX area and am looking for an opportunity: I am looking for a XXXX type of practice that will provide me with a place to.

The sole focus of my endeavors is to bring high quality care with a 'fantastic' guest experience. I want patients to leave our practice not thinking of me as a dentist; but as a friend and helper along their path to better smiles and healthier teeth. Because of this, I have taken the appropriate education to develop more skills with implants, endodontics, wisdom tooth surgery, sedation, and cosmetic reconstruction.

If you, or a dentist you know, has been thinking about cutting back, selling, retiring, or has a desire to transition into a different role in their practice, you can text or call: XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Sincerely;

After you've gained a list of at least a few potential acquisitions, you can then start the process of evaluating the practices using the next set of resources. It is important to remember at this stage that you will most likely evaluate many practices before coming to a practice that will be a good match financially for you: In our experience, for each practice purchase, we have gone through an average evaluation of 4-6 practices before finding a practice that was the right fit for the situation. Just as you don't (usually) marry the first person you ever dated, you usually will not buy the first practice you evaluate.

Perrin DesPortes, of Polaris Healthcare Partners, describes his process in 5 steps:

1. Identifying: Look for your list of desired locations and possible prospects
2. Connecting: Breaking the ice to let them know you are interested and see about their potential desires
3. Pitching: Let them know that you're interested, and show them why it should be you who purchases them
4. Courting: Stay in the game consistently, connect with them personally
5. Closing: Takes 3-12 months, and may even fall apart due to any number of circumstances.

To truly gain a thorough understanding of an acquisition, you will want to go through the next spreadsheet with as much detail as possible: This will give you a good evaluation of the practice, and its financials. We will also address some of the finer points to consider after this evaluation is completed.

# Acquisition Analysis

After receiving 'leads' on a few practices, you will need to ask for all relevant information on the practices to start doing proper analysis of each of them. The following documents are required to do a full analysis of the practice:

- Last 3 years Profit and Loss Statements
- Last 3 years Tax Returns
- Codes and Production over the last 3 years
- Everything in the 'Acquisition Analysis Spreadsheet' for general information

Download this document from the QR Code here.

The 'Acquisition Analysis' Spreadsheet has many good questions and prompts that you may not have considered when looking at a potential purchase. The first page of the Acquisition analysis is the financial considerations. On this page, you will include any and all information that is generally available about the office. This can be taken from Profit and Loss Statements or from documents such as their previous tax returns.

After adding some of the financial information, move to the next spreadsheet page and work on answering as much of the information about the practice as possible. See the picture of this sheet on the next page. This sheet has 88 questions that will get you to the clearest picture of the practice in a relatively short period of time. If any of the questions on this sheet are not a match with your vision, now is the time to make a decision as to whether you want to spend any more time on the evaluation of this practice, or to move on to another one.

When evaluating multiple practices, it is important to remember aspects of the practice that either a) can be changed in an acquisition, or b) cannot be changed in an acquisition: When we have done acquisitions in the past; we have purchased practices that on the surface seemed like complete mis-matches with our vision: We knew however that we could instantly change many things to more closely align with our vision: During your search, remember the list of things that can be changed: (Not completely exhaustive)

- Softwares used
- Technology used
- Current Staff - can all be changed if needed
- Employee benefits
- Esthetics of the practice
- Brand of the practice
- Labs they are using
- Supplies they use
- Collections policies
- Insurances that you are either in-network or out-of-network with
- Current Marketing
- New patient flow

As you consider the aspects of the practice that can be changed, the list can grow quite quickly: As soon as a new owner comes into the practice, things can begin to look and feel drastically different. For instance, the practice could be Fee-for-Service and you could immediately bring on many insurances as in-network status to help grow new patient bases if needed. The entire staff could be people whom you do not see wanting to grow with you: You could change them out quickly for others who would match your style. Keep in mind that you have a lot of freedom as a new owner to make changes.
---
More importantly is to be able to recognize the things that cannot be changed:

- Location (At least not extremely quickly unless you have another location nearby to merge)
- Rent (Unless the landlord is willing to renegotiate)
- Fixed Equipment and floorplan

As you evaluate the practice, this list is possibly the most important to evaluate. If the location is good and visible, you can be reasonably comfortable to keep progressing through the evaluation. If the practice is hidden or the floorplan is terrible and the rent is high, it might be best to move onto another acquisition analysis and keep the process moving:

The last step is to do a 'production by procedure' report. This will give you an idea of the untapped opportunities available within the practice being evaluated. In the associated document link from the beginning of the book, you can download the spreadsheet: The spreadsheet gives you the ADA Code analysis page shown on the next page. If the seller is using OpenDental, you can export the production by procedures into an excel spreadsheet: You can then take columns A-F and copy them into this spreadsheet. The spreadsheet then reads all of the codes directly and decides whether it is Diagnostic, Preventative, Restorative, or any of the other major categories.

Once all the data is all entered into each sheet, it will complete all the calculations and give you a pie chart; shown next, of all the production by dollar amount that the previous doctor has completed:

# Doctor 1

|Diagnostic|Preventative|Restorative|Crown and Bridge|Endodontics|Surgery|Implants|Ortho|Perio|Dentures|Cosmetics|Other|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5.6%|16.2%|9.9%| |3.6%|11.2%| | | |18.1%| |28.29|

One of the most valuable aspects of this chart is being able to see how their clinical offerings compare with yours and how you might best be able to capture more production by offering a more diverse skill set: Do they do a lot of implant surgery? Do they offer orthodontic services? Do they keep endodontics services in-house or refer them out? If their services are part of your repertoire you can reasonably expect to be able to keep these services in house and grow the revenue of the practice. If they offer services that you do not offer; you have to make a decision: Either you get advanced training in that area or risk overpaying for a practice that generates production from procedures that you cannot perform.

# Doc 2

|Sedation|Diagnostic|Preventative|Restorative|Crown and Bridge|

|Dentures|Perio|Implants|Surgery|Endodontics|
|2.6%|2.480|6.196|25.1%|4%|

If you have multiple doctors, you can also use the spreadsheet to compare what the different doctors of the practice are completing: Sometimes, this looks good in pie chart format; but we have also given you the ability to measure by bar-graph as well because each doctor will produce at varying levels.

After going through the process on this spreadsheet, as well as the demographics and traffic numbers, you will have enough information to know whether you want to pursue this opportunity or pass on it:

# Quantify Where You Can Improve It

As you look at possible acquisition targets, you will want to evaluate every area where you could possibly improve the practice. We hope there are many areas, but this is a good exercise to write these areas down, because you will want to use them as goals, and many financing institutions will also want to see this. (This will be used to help identify areas in the next chapter where revenues will rise, and costs will decline.)

Increased revenues are the first area that you should evaluate. This comes mainly in two forms: expanded services and more capacity: In the service category; you will want to see exactly where you can add more services due to your skills and knowledge. This could include:

- More services based around new technologies that you use (Clear aligner therapy; 3D printing & milling)
- Specialty services like root canals, wisdom teeth extractions, IV sedation, periodontal surgery, and high-esthetic cases
- Improved hygiene services including more periodontal treatment and laser treatments

The other primary area where you can add revenues is by increasing capacity: This could include expanding the physical location, where the building could be expanded, or additional lease space could be rented. Achieving this is expensive, but the additional revenues can be seen quickly if there are capacity problems at the current time. Sometimes the seller knows there are capacity issues but when they are close to selling the asset; they will never want to make large capital investments. The other way to add capacity is to expand hours. While this is usually very easy; it is important to remember that working nights and weekends is sometimes difficult in the new age where workers want more work-life balance. We often see that expanded hours cause a higher staff turnover:

In addition to more space and more hours, there are two other options. One would be to increase fee schedules and reimbursement rates. This will be addressed later in the book, but is
---
usually done within the first year after taking over from the former owner: Depending on insurance negotiations, this can have a significant effect: (We address the best way to handle this later in the book.) The other option is to just schedule more efficiently: By aligning doctor and assistant time in a more efficient manner; you can often see a huge revenue opportunity; with no incremental increased costs. To schedule more efficiently, it only takes a little training and awareness of doctor time.

The other opportunity that you will need to quantify is expected cost savings. This can be a large amount of money due to the places where the former owner might not have been optimized. We often see cost savings in a few areas:

|Dental Supplies|Target is 4%, often we see practices in the 8-10% range|
|---|---|
|Lab Costs|Target is 6%, some practices are up to 12%|
|Employee Benefits|large range but joining a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) can help mitigate costs|
|Office Supplies|This is a place where many costs can accrue and hurt a seller's bottom line|
|Marketing Costs|Sometimes former owners waste lots of money on marketing that is not being tracked|

Assessing the upside opportunity of any potential acquisition is a guessing game in many scenarios, but we can assure you that you will want to go through this exercise. While evaluating each of these areas, you will want to put an actual target number; or percent, to each category: You will then want to evaluate this each year for the first couple years to see if your goals were achieved, or maybe wildly surpassed.

# Practice Tour

One of the final stages of the analysis is the live practice visit: Typically, a seller will arrange for this after hours if the sale is confidential. They may ask you to park off-street and be very discreet about the visit. Requests of this nature are normal and should not be cause for alarm.

As you take the tour; keep in mind what aspects are changeable, and which are not: Paint colors, countertops, flooring, and supplies can all be changed very quickly: Even the leather color on chairs can be changed with relative ease with reupholstery: The equipment can be changed if absolutely needed, but there's a good reason to take note of all existing equipment.

Below is the list of details that you should know about each large piece of equipment in the practice. This is used for valuation purposes, negotiation tactics, and as a comprehensive record in the event that you purchase the practice.

|Location| |

|Date of Evaluation| |
|Rep or Tech name that installed/sold the equipment| |
|Type of Equipment| |

# Age

# Color/Style

# Recommended replacement?

# Notes

Following the tour; you should have a good idea as to whether the practice is a match for you. This can be an exciting moment;, but it is always important to remember to remain emotionally unattached, as there are many deals that look good initially; that do not end up working out for one reason or another;

The next chapter will help prepare you for the financial implications of purchasing a new business, before the negotiating process actually begins.

# Potential Pitfalls

The numbers of a practice might look really good. The aesthetics of the practice are modern and stylish: The team seems upbeat and ready for a new owner. However; there could be things under the surface that would make this acquisition nightmare rather than a dream. We have seen many situations over the years where an acquisition turns out to be extremely bad for one reason or another. For these reasons we want to make sure you learn from the experience of others, rather than learning yourself.

Here's a few simplified examples:

- Doctor selling the practice to 'move back to family'. Production was average to low; and the mix of patients seemed to be PPO and Medicaid. Unfortunately; they hid the fact that they gave extreme discounts on almost everything, their percentage of Medicaid was much higher than in any paperwork they presented early in the process. Acquisition went through and the purchaser found out that it was 80% Medicaid. This office struggled for years and was ultimately closed-merged into another office.
- How to avoid it? Get the most detailed reports available from the practice management system: Make sure it is not possible for the seller to re-categorize these patients on a separate form, you need actual reports.
- Doctor sold this high-revenue practice for over $1M. New buyer comes in with a similar skillset (probably even better), but different age and ethnicity of the doctor: The selling doctor was an older female from an Eastern European background, spoke Russian, and had a loyal following of Russian-speaking patients. New doctor was a younger male and was not of the same ethnicity; nor did they speak Russian. The patient base was quickly.
---
weary of the change and it was extremely difficult to achieve the same level of production. Make sure that you evaluate the 'social' aspect of the patient.

# How to avoid it?

Will the patients feel comfortable switching to you? Is there a language that many of the patients speak that is different from your own?

Selling doctor patched all the equipment and real estate issues to look good right up until the sale. In the weeks and months after the sale, equipment broke down weekly: This ended up costing an extra $50,000 to fix all these issues over that time until new equipment could be ordered.

# How to avoid it?

Make sure you have an equipment rep or repair person go with you to an acquisition closer to the closing date to evaluate all the equipment and whether there are any pressing needs. While many things are difficult to find, they should help you evaluate these needs and hopefully ward off any future problems.

Selling doctor had a great production; but the production was primarily based on crown, bridges and implants. The office sold at a high premium; but the truth was that almost every tooth that needed any work was already crowned: When the new doctor transitioned in, there was very little work that needed to be done. The purchasing doctor was now paying a high loan on a premium practice, but not getting any revenues off the patients that they acquired/obtained.

# How to avoid it?

Make sure to go through the previous spreadsheet and do the procedure analysis. You will be able to see if their percentages match the targeted ranges, and whether they have been getting a large percentage of their production from crown and bridge. If so, be weary of paying a high dollar amount for a practice with not many procedures left to do.

# Financials

The next stage in the acquisition process is to get all your financial paperwork together: This can happen when you find an office, but usually even before settling on a final decision. Be ready to take some serious time to get all this together; and start discussions with a finance institution before putting in a final offer on a practice.

It is necessary to have this paperwork organized to ensure that a financial institution or bank will lend you the money it will take to make the acquisition. Although you may not have a final decision on a practice, it's prudent to start this side of the process in order to be able to move quickly once you have decided on a practice and purchase price.

The documents listed are important for this stage of the process and can be accessed by scanning the QR code here.

To begin, you'll need these documents:

- Personal Financial Statement
- Loan Calculator
- Pro Forma Spreadsheet (after you've settled on a practice to purchase)
- Budget Gameplan (after you've settled on a practice to purchase)
- Master Formulary
- Supply Budget

While these are important as you approach banks, it is even worthwhile to update with some frequency after your acquisition is complete. We often keep updated personal finance statements and loan calculators for ourselves each month.

# Personal Financial Statement

A PFS is a snapshot in time of your financial picture. It includes:

- Cash in banks
- Accounts Receivables that are to be paid to you
---
# Securities/stocks/bonds owned by you

Any real estate you own

Any vehicles or other assets you own

Any insurances you own that have cash surrender value

Any debts you owe in student loans

Any real estate debt

Any vehicle or asset debt

Any accounts payable (bills that you have due)

Usually a bank will also want to know your occupation, place of employment, length of employment; income, and your typical monthly living expenses. This will give them a pretty good idea of your risk profile, and credit worthiness.

We really encourage people to update their PFS monthly or quarterly: This habit will keep you constantly aware of your financial standing and net worth. It will also be requested by financial institutions repeatedly throughout your business life, so keeping it updated will ensure that it is readily available when necessary.

There are several web applications that are widely used to keep track of all of your financial details automatically: One that we like is 'Mint' by Intuit: This is the same company that created QuickBooks, and their web-based software can tie into any other bank software and mortgage schedule to keep you with an updated PFS in real-time.

# Loan Balances

Once you start to become more successful, you will probably take out more debt for either personal or business items. This can sometimes become a complicated web of entities, timelines, and amounts of money. This spreadsheet is a helpful tool for tracking all of your loans in one place. So here's how to use it:

1. Obtain the paperwork for each loan that you have for any business/personal entities.
2. Start at Loan A.
3. Place the Entity, Lender, Loan Title, Term, Rate, and any other pertinent information.
4. Make sure to put the monthly payments in the column as hard-coded.
5. If the interest doesn't accrue correctly; you may have to type that amount in each month as well (Some banks do daily interest - which is hard to replicate).
6. Go through steps 2-5 for each loan.
7. In Summary Cell L2 - pick the matching correct number for the month.
8. Zero out any unused sheets.
9. The sheet should be usable now.
10. Going forward, any month that you pay additional - put that added principal payment in the column on that loan.

# Loan Amortization Schedule

Here is an example from the first 'Loan' tab. For each loan that you have, fill out the table below; which is normally called an amortization schedule. Make sure the payments are accurate for each month, as well as interest rate, and the ending balance for each month going forward. Typically the Excel spreadsheet will calculate this accurately, unless your bank has a different method of executing their interest rate.

# Pro Forma Spreadsheet

The Pro Forma Spreadsheet is the next document that will be requested. This is specifically a document that outlines what the practice expects to profit or lose over the first couple of years.

After going through the exercise, you will get to see exactly how much money you will need from the bank in the form of 'working capital'. (Working capital is a short-term loan from the bank that covers operational expenses for the first few months then is paid back quickly because it is usually at a higher interest rate. Sometimes working capital is also called a line of credit.)

If throughout negotiations you decide to purchase the accounts receivable (AR) from the seller; then you might not need much working capital: If you buy the AR, this means that the collections coming in from the first day are 100% yours to keep. This can surely help cash flow and make things go smoother from day 1, however there's some calculations to be done before deciding whether this is the best course of action. We will address that in the next chapter:

However; if you decide not to purchase the AR, you will surely need some working capital to run the business before collections ramp up to a level where it will cover all necessary expenses.

The Pro Forma is also extremely useful to plot out how much you think you'll want to spend in different departments in order to hit the growth goals you have set out for yourself.

# Pro Forma Spreadsheet Key Points:

- Tells you how much you would need from a bank in a line of credit
- Use as a projected budget for the future
- Overestimate for unexpected expenses
- Borrow aggressively and spend conservatively

To start the Pro Forma, download the document and follow these steps.

Along the top, enter the months in text boxes. The mock sheet has you purchasing and taking over your practice starting in July: However; remember that there are some expenses to expect before you start; including legal, accounting, and any other miscellaneous expenses. (If you are sending out a mailing; informing the patient base of the transition, you might split the cost with the seller and that expense might actually be in the month or days before you actually start seeing any revenues from the practice.)

Begin entering how much revenue you will plan on receiving each month. This is not 'production', it is only collections. Keep in mind that collections always trail production by at least 30-60 days, especially at the beginning of your acquisition. This is typically due to insurance negotiations, payment plans, and the slower flow of patients. However; if you do decide to purchase the Accounts Receivable (AR), then you can expect a better immediate cash flow:

Enter all cost categories and their expected monthly cost.

- Some are based on a percentage of revenues like supplies or lab costs. These are the "variable expenses".
- Some are more stable costs like rent, utilities, or insurance. These are considered the fixed costs and do not change with increases in revenues.

The staff payroll line is calculated off of the second tab, and is a computed number based on the hours of an employee each month, as well as their pay rate.
---
employee's start date, pay rate, and expected hours. If you already have this number from the seller; enter the payroll that they have seen over the past few months.

At the bottom of the sheet; you will see that the costs start to add up and then culminate into the 'EBITDA' line. This is your overall profitability line. The line below the EBITDA line is then the Net Negative financial number: If you buy the AR, then you probably will not dip into a negative number at all. However; if you decide to pass on the AR, then you will most likely need to prepare to go negative. This negative number is how 'low' your bank account will go during the first phase of your startup. This is also the number you should tell your bank you will require in a working capital loan:

# Keys to the ProForma:

- underestimate revenues
- Always overestimate expenses
- Always tell the bank a higher working capital loan if you will be using one

No matter whether you buy the AR or not; you should plan on getting a working capital loan or line of credit from the bank:

See the next two pages for examples of the Pro Forma:

# Budget Gameplan

Once you're up and running; the Pro Forma Spreadsheet no longer works to track real-time expenses. While the Pro Forma is great for setting out a plan in the future to get financing, you need a dynamic sheet to help in the operational aspects of your new business. That's why we created the Budget + Gameplan sheet: This Budget is only for your internal use, however the financing institution might be interested to see this spreadsheet every few years to see how the practice has been producing and where they expect it to grow. See the spreadsheet here:

|Examipka Dental|201|JAlT1|Aua / 502|Ocl 21|Dec 21|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Actundi|0M|085|085|21415|00x 485|
| |04415| |67415|27|45|
| |1|Yetls|subxliguo| | |

In this sheet, it gives you a 12 month picture of your practice and all expenses. This sheet is organized in a similar fashion as the Pro Forma, but can also be changeable to the specific areas of your practice where you'll have expenses. There are 3 main tabs in this spreadsheet:

- Gameplan
- Actual
- Comparison

The Gameplan can also be referred to as the 'Budget'. It is the expected revenues and costs of the practice over the next 12 months. All the revenues drop down into the 'Total Income' column; all expenses are below: Each category of expenses is a computed total line for the category; it is then all added up into the total net revenues at the bottom.

For setting up the Gameplan, we usually suggest that you do this exercise in November of the previous year: During this time, you should review all expenses of the practice, see where you're above normal percentages, see where you're doing well, and then plot out the next full year: Going through this exercise can take some effort; but it is valuable for helping to plan for both staffing levels, expected profit, and taxes.

When putting in the Gameplan numbers, remember that some columns are going to be variable expenses, and we suggest trying to tie those costs to a percentage basis of the revenues. For example, your goal might be to keep dental supplies at 4.5% of revenues. In this case, you
---
should put 4.5% X Revenues for this cost category. However; some are fixed expenses, and in this case you should put those as flat-line numbers across the sheet For example, rent will not fluctuate month-to-month, so you can enter the costs and you won't need to correlate this number with production at all.

The Actual tab is the costs that you put in each month as you go through the year: It will start out empty and then you will add your costs each month as you go through the year: One thing to remember is that as you change anything on the Gameplan tab, that you'll want to change it on the Actual and Comparison tabs as well in the exact same place.

The final tab, and the aspect where this spreadsheet truly helps- is the Comparison tab. On this page, it will show you the dynamic Month comparison, year to date comparison, and end of year comparison: The only box to be changed on this page is to do the pull-down menu picking which month you're at so far: After you pick that; it will decide which columns to add up on the other tabs, then you can then start to do an analysis of what is going well and what is not:

|Ordinary Income|ForinaMenthoti|Yuar-to-Dule| |God-otYerr| | | | | |

While the Budget + Gameplan is a complicated sheet with a lot going on, we highly suggest using this or some other software to track.

# Master Formulary

The best way to control dental supply costs is to keep a master formulary for all supplies. This will be the top 400 items that you order on a semi-regular basis. All of your composite impression materials, stone, personal protective equipment, and so on.

|SKU|Description|Quantity In PK|
|---|---|---|
|8053006|Accuject 27g Short Needles|100|
|8871416|Monoject 30g Short Needles|100|
|8871418|Monoject 30g X-Short Needles|100|
|8200360|Carbocalne 3% Plain| |
|8050215|Citanest Forte 4% w/lepi| |
|9515510|Lidocaine HCL 2% w/lepi| |
|8053850|Polocaine 3% Plain| |
|9533808|Protector Needle Sheaths|500|
|9515480|Seplocaine Gold 4% 1:100| |
|9515482|Septocaine Silver 4% 1:200| |
|3414070|Sharps Container| |
|9521621|Topex Topical Gel Cherry (Sultan)|1 oz|
|9521658|Topex Topical Gel Strawberry (Sultan)|1 oz|
|Slabident| |20/pk|

The first step in the process of creating your own master formulary is to assemble the list of all the supplies that you will ever order: When we say all; we truly do mean all: This is going to seem like an insanely tall order; however it is vital to keep costs down: You will not want anyone on your team ordering random supplies from different places. You know what you want; so set the ground rules.

With taking over an acquisition, there might be things you don't like to order; but are necessary to match the items or equipment that the facility uses. We have definitely had that experience with radiological film developing liquids. There have been offices we have purchased that still used film, and we haven't been able to switch away fast enough, so we had to purchase the expensive bottles of liquids!

After you have the supply list, go through and find the best cost for each supply: In the past; we've had an assistant do this. However; there are now softwares that are much more adept at giving real-time pricing and availability for products. Our favorite is called Dentira. It is a real-time calculated software that will help you keep your supplies at the lowest cost possible while actually being quite user friendly.

After you have entered the costs into the spreadsheet; if you choose to do it manually; you can then create orders as often as necessary; and then you will be able to go to wherever you can.

# Supply Budget

The biggest cost overrun for most practices is the supply budget: We have found that time and time again in small practices, and even groups that have revenues upwards of $8 Million per year: Sometimes it's "percentage creep", where at one point the practice was spending only 4.5%, and then eventually it rises to 6% or 7%. Spread out over time, this can add up to hundreds of thousands even millions of dollars.

The best way to combat this is to track your supply spending in a detailed manner: This spreadsheet will help. To start, you will want to put in your historical revenues into the first page shown below: In this example, it starts with April 2021 with $20,000. Then $50,000 in May and going forward. Basically your target supply spend should be anywhere between 4 and 5% of the last 3 months averaged revenues: So if you're consistently collecting $50,000 in revenues, then 4% times that number is $2,000 a month to spend on supplies.

Remember that in growth mode it is not wise to try to squeeze expenses too much. This will increase the risk that you could run out of materials and not be able to finish a procedure. Especially after the COVID supply chain problems following 2020, it is dangerous to keep a low stock on items. For this reason, you'll need to always maintain moderate quantities of supplies while simultaneously keeping an eye on the budget. As you approach your predetermined spending limit, you'll need to start making tough decisions on where to cut costs.

As you start tracking your orders, use the second tab in the spreadsheet: The top line of the spreadsheet will have you enter your budget in large numbers. This is the number copied over from the first sheet: Then, in each line below that; you'll enter the date you ordered, the vendor; the supplies you ordered, and the cost: With each order; you will receive an invoice at a later date and you'll want to double check it for accuracy; as there are often discrepancies.

# Order Tracking

|Date Order|Vendor|Supplies|Total Spent|
|---|---|---|---|
|April 2021|Ceaals|desensitizing gel, microbrush lips|$518.32|
|4/21|Ebay|couplers/handpieces|$583.26|
|4/21|Darby|saliva ejectors, small/medium gloves, chlorhexidine|$256.00|
---
After each month ends, you will then move all those cells downward, and add in enough space to put a new month in: This way you can always keep your supplies on a running tab, be able to verify that you received the order; and keep costs within the budget for each month.

We hope that these documents in this section have been helpful and will allow you to execute the acquisition process with more clarity around the financial sides. While it might seem like a lot of work up-front; we often think back to the quote from Jocko Willink about execution: He says, "We do not rise to the occasion, we fall to the highest level of preparation. We know that going through this level of financial preparation will allow you to be absolutely prepared for executing an acquisition and transition with financial stability."

Finishing these documents in this chapter; you are now fully prepared to start negotiating and working towards acquiring a practice.

# Chapter 4

# Valuation and Negotiation

The next stage in the acquisition journey is to establish a real value for a practice and begin the negotiation process. By this stage, you have researched and visited the practice. Hopefully the broker or seller has now furnished the accurate numbers and documentation in order for you to come to an appropriate valuation on the office. As stated in the earlier chapter; the minimum documents that you need are the following:

1. Last 3 years Profit and Loss Statements
2. Last 3 years Tax Returns
3. Codes and Production over the last 3 years
4. Everything in the 'Acquisition Analysis Spreadsheet' for general information

After you have obtained these documents, you will be able to begin the valuation process. While doing this exercise, keep in mind that the value that you put on the practice is all part of the negotiations process and also provides you with a deeper understanding of the economics of the practice you wish to purchase. It is important to realize that no valuation method is perfect.

A valuation is truly just used as a tool utilized by both sides of a negotiation table to give each party a starting point: The seller could have a valuation that they use to increase the price. Similarly; you could find your own valuation that you use to decrease the price. Methods differ; price differs, and it's all part of the game.

The final value of the practice will really come down on whatever price the buyer is willing to pay, and whatever the seller is willing to accept: This is the way a free market works, and of course there are a myriad of variables that either tilt the tables in your direction or your sellers!

To gain a further understanding on all the intricate pieces at play during an acquisition process, we recommend 'The Art of Selling your Business' by John Warrillow. This will help you understand the seller's attitude, and thereby allow you to gain a better picture of how you can negotiate strategically.

# Valuation

There are a couple of reliable methods that are used to determine the value of a dental practice if you will be the sole practitioner of the entity: Some selling doctors think it is a percentage of historical revenues, or some other measure similar to this. However, we should look at the bigger picture, and the important, relevant data. Rather than using methods that were created in an antiquated dental practice industry, we need to treat this like a real business. When looking at a practice, some methods leave out many important variables. For us to come to the most accurate method that allows you to have long-term financial success, we need to include all these variables. In the dental market, we will describe the three major methods of valuing a practice, and then we will go in depth on the one we think is most accurate. Here are the three major ways to value a dental practice:

- Percentage of Historical Revenues
- Multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization)
- Value of Equipment and Hard Assets

# Percentage of Historical Revenues

This is one of the most common ways that practice brokers will try to value a practice before they put it on the market. It has a history that is as old as dentistry; but one that should probably be left in the prehistoric, 'wooden dentures' era. While we still see it utilized often, the flaws in this methodology outweigh the advantages and in most cases there are better ways to arrive at an accurate value.

Practice brokers will often value a practice at 60%-100% of the previous year's revenues. Typically the range is even narrower at 60%-80%, but for certain areas of the country it can be higher. If the practice is older or has more undesirable properties, then the price will most likely fall into the lower percentage range. However, if the practice is newer, with more desirable qualities, the value will move towards a higher percentage.

# Here's an example:

|Prior Years Revenues|$440,000|
|---|---|
|60%|$264,000|
|100%|$440,000|

In the example above, the valuation on this practice would fall somewhere between $264,000 and $440,000 depending on health of the business, quality of fixed assets, and other contributing factors. While we do not necessarily encourage buyers to use this method, we recommend multiple methods of valuation applied in order to get a range of price points.
---
A few key advantages to this methodology:

- Easy to execute quickly
- No need for high level financial analysis

And a few key disadvantages:

- Valuation is not based on the profitability of the practice
- Valuation is calculated without analyzing the health of the business

In summary; the percentage of prior years revenues methodology is a measuring stick, but can be an inaccurate method to calculate the true value of the business. Without taking a thorough analysis of multiple aspects of the business into account, an accurate valuation cannot be calculated: We would describe this method as trying to value a car by only looking only at the exterior. It might aesthetically look pleasing in paint color and interior leather; but if the engine and mechanicals are broken, then the car would not be worth much.

# EBITDA

EBITDA stands for 'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization'. Basically; EBITDA is the cash earnings of the business without all of the tax implications, which really only happen after you make money. When you start any valuation, it is always good to get the prior 3 years tax returns from the seller's business. Three years gives a decent picture of the average collections of the business, and since it is reported to the IRS, usually you can trust that it is true. Of course some people rob the IRS of due taxes, but hopefully that's not the person selling to you! The other more detailed way to get these numbers is to get the actual Profit and Loss statements from the seller or their accountant. The P&L as we call it, will give you a proper look at all of the collections and expense categories that can be lost on the IRS forms. These P&L statements will help you to understand what cost categories may be high or low based on the type of procedures the seller is performing. These reports may even give you an idea of ways to improve the profitability of the practice once you take ownership.

# Step 1: Normalize

Once you have 3 years of tax returns or P&L statements, you then need to normalize each year: Often dentists will run certain expenses through the business that may not be necessary when a new owner takes over: This may include the doctor's entire family cell phone bill, their home internet (for home office use of course), their car; and occasionally their boat, lake house, or plane. Some doctors like to fly their plane to their weekend CE courses!

Many expenses can legally be run through your business. Meals with people when you meet with them on business related topics are quite common. Vehicle expenses are common as well. To this rule: vehicle expenses should be kept at a moderate level unless the car is used for business purposes a majority of the time. In case you possibly use your personal car for a majority of the time, there is a document called an Agency Agreement, which allows your business to pay for a majority of the costs of your personal car if certain requirements are met:
---
The best way to normalize the income is to copy the most recent P&L into a spreadsheet: column A, list the P&L categories. In column B, put the costs from the dental practice as it is currently being run. In column C, remove the expenses that will be eliminated with new ownership: These expenses include travel, CE, and other items that aren't critical to the running of the business. They can also include donations, or advertising expenses that are really just set up as donations. For example, perhaps the previous dentist sponsored his child's baseball team. Will that continue? They gave $2,000 to the Save the Beetles campaign, but is this expense critical to the business success? After removing those expenses, the cost of these perks should be added into the profitability of the practice. See the simple example below:

|2020 P&L|Normalized|New P&L|
|---|---|---|
|Income|600,000|600,000|
|Staff costs|180,000|180,000|
|Dentist Salary|150,000|150,000|
|Supplies|36,000|36,000|
|Lab Fees|48,000|48,000|
|Vehicle|7,640|-7,640|
|Office Costs|17,800|17,800|
|Rent|24,700|24,700|
|Donations|2,000|-2,000|
|Advertising|15,000|15,000|
|Travel and CE|9,000|9,000|
|Other|5,500|5,500|
|Profit|$104,360|Normalized:|
| | |$123,000|

Important to this exercise is assigning salary levels for the owner or associate dentists. This can be something from $80,000 to $180,000. This impacts taxes for the seller as they take income.
---
but also impacts valuation. For a practice, try to use a calculation that is typical for an associate or senior dentist. If the practice is producing $600,000, it is not realistic to pay the dentist $60,000, or 10%. First and foremost, if the IRS notices this, they will probably perform an audit and back taxes might be owed. Secondly, it's unlikely that you would be able to become an associate and take home only 10% of collections. Finding good associates is challenging, and finding ones that will work for 10% is impossible. In this scenario, and in general, you should make the dentist's salary as much as 25% of collections. Typically it is closer to 30% of collections; but may be as high as 35% of collections in certain areas of the country.

Also make sure to watch for a selling dentist to try to normalize the profit as high as possible. It is in their interest to get that profit number up, thereby increasing the value of the practice. At this point all normalization becomes a negotiation. Hopefully all parties involved in the transaction understand what makes true business expenses. This will make a fairly easy agreement on the actual profit calculation of the practice.

# Step 2:

Once you perform this 'normalization' exercise for each of the previous 3 years, you can then perform the EBITDA calculation. The table below shows the calculations:

| |Most Recent Year|2018|2019|2020|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|EBITDA|$113,000|$117,500|$123,000| |
|Weighted Multiple|$113,000|$235,000|$369,000| |
|Total Multiple|$717,000| | | |
|Total divided by Average|$119,500| | | |
|Weighted EBITDA| | | | |

As you can see, the previous 2 years weren't as profitable as the most recent. It is prudent to give more weight to the most recent year; because the new dentist will hopefully be able to match that production and income. Previous years have less weight due to various factors including different rents, costs, and the overall economy.

After multiplying the EBITDA by the weight, you then add all of the totals together for a large sum. In this scenario, it is $717,000. Since you multiplied all the previous numbers by 1, 2 and 6.
---
3, then you add those together for a total of 6. Then divide $717,000 by 6 to get your annualized average weighted EBITDA.

If you were to look at 4 years of returns, you would take the weights of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then divide by 10. In this scenario, you arrive at $119,500 for the average weighted EBITDA. This is the number that is used as the benchmark by most corporate brokerage firms. They all take this number and apply a multiple to it. In the dental industry, it is common to have multiples of anywhere from 3 to 6. A multiple of 3 would indicate a practice that needs some updating in either equipment, technology, or both. This indicates the practice will need some investment from the buyer right at the time of the sale. As you move towards 4, this indicates the practice is already producing and collecting at a good rate. A practice with a multiple of 4 would need no major investment from the buyer: Typically a '4' practice is a very good practice that many potential buyers would be eager to purchase. There have been sales of EBITDA multiples in the 4.5 to 6.5 range, but those are typically paid for by investors or corporate groups who have a plethora of free cash that needs to be invested quickly. They tend to have private equity backing, and are willing to pay more to enter a market they think is good. Above 4 is not a typical dental practice multiple in the single doctor practice category.

# See the table below for potential values for our example practice.

|Multiple|3|5|6|7|8|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Price|$358,500|$418,250|$478,000|$597,500|$717,000|

After plugging the numbers into this table, we see that the value of this dental practice is anywhere between $358,000 and $717,000. This is definitely a large range, but can point to the wide range that valuations can occur in valuing a practice. This is also just the starting point for the valuation. After assigning this valuation multiple, you begin to assess things that are not included in the calculation. Use the factors in the next section to determine whether the multiple should be closer to the lower end of the range, or the higher. Also, it might allow you room to negotiate if some other variables are in play.

# Value of Equipment and Hard Assets

In some cases, the value of the business cannot be calculated from either a percentage of historical collections or the EBITDA method. In these cases, you will have to come up with a third method. The third way to value a practice is whatever it would cost you to build this exact practice in today's dollars, and then 'discount' it back based on age of the practice and equipment:

|Name|Value|
|---|---|
|Buildout|$345,000|
|Server|$3,000|
|Xray Sensors|$7,000|
|CBCT|$47,000|
|Phones|$4,000|
|Supplies|$15,000|
|Chairs|$38,000|
|Dental Units|$14,000|
|Cabinetry|$12,000|
|Suction|$4,000|
|Compressor|$5,000|
|Xray tubes|$6,000|
|TOTAL|$500,000|
---
Let us assume that to build a brand new practice, it will cost $500,000 in construction of the build-out, equipment, supplies, and technology. Here is a list of a 'startup' budget and the approximate costs for each piece of equipment: Each of these is an approximate value for the equipment and costs that you would incur to do a startup in the area. Of course, it is important to remember that if you actually did the startup, then all of the equipment would be brand new and everything would be exactly the way you want it. However, you would also have no patients, income, or team members to help you start the practice.

The next step is to then factor in some of the age of the equipment: In order to factor in the age of the equipment, we must take into account its lifespan. For example, the server we purchased for $3,000 will only last about 5 years. If the server is 3 years old, then we have already 'used up' 60% of the value of that server. This only leaves the remaining 40% of value in the server, which is $1,200. When we start to do that for each subsection of the possible practice acquisition, we come up with a spreadsheet like this:

# Valuation of Equipment and Hard Assets

|Name|Age|Lifespan|Remaining Value|Discounted Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Buildout|40|33|83%|$284,625|
|Server| | |40%|$1,200|
|Xray Sensors|10| |70%|$4,900|
|CBCT|10| |70%|$32,900|
|Phones|10| |70%|$2,800|
|Supplies|100|100|100%|$15,000|
|Chairs|25|18|72%|$27,360|
|Dental Units|25|18|72%|$10,080|
|Cabinetry|40|33|83%|$9,900|
|Suction|15| |53%|$2,133|
|Compressor|15| |53%|$2,667|
|Xray tubes|25|18|72%|$4,320|

New Value: $500,000

Today's Value: $397,885

In this example, the brand new practice would cost $500,000, however since some of the equipment is 3 years old, the practice value of the equipment is only $397,885. When you are doing this calculation, you must use this as an anchor to consider that if you were to purchase the practice for $397,885, you would essentially be getting the existing patients, team, and systems for free. This method is useful for vacant practices, and for internal calculations or quick sale of practices where there might not be any patient charts.

# Other Factors in Practice Valuation

Here are some other factors in determining the value of a practice that might help in determining the appropriate EBITDA multiple, or the appropriate percentage of revenue for valuation purposes:

# Location:

- Is the practice in a prime location?
- What's the strength of the competition in the surrounding areas?
- What are daily traffic numbers on the street outside the front door?
- What is the number of rooftops in the 1-mile, 3-mile, and 5-mile radius?
- What is the growth plan for the city around this location? Growing or stagnant?

# PPO participation:

- How many PPO plans does the office take?
- What percentage of patients are covered by which PPO plans?
- What percentage of write-off do the PPO plans take off the usual and customary fees?

# Physical location:

- Are you buying the building/space?
- Are the lease or sale terms favorable for the buyer?
- Number of operatories - Is there room for growth?
- Age of building - Will there be higher repair costs in the future?
- Are there enough parking spots for the practice?
- Is parking directly in front of the space or is it often occupied by an adjacent tenant?

# Equipment:

- Age and quality of equipment?
- Use Acquisition Analysis Spreadsheet for equipment list
- Will any equipment need to be updated?
- Will there be any technology that needs updating?

# Staff Retention:

- How many staff will be staying on?
- What is the current compensation for the staff - above or below market rate?

# Procedures performed:

- Does the doctor perform many procedures that are specialized in nature?
- Implants, full mouth reconstruction, molar root canals
- Does the doctor do all their own hygiene?
- Does the doctor already do a high volume of crowns? (Will all teeth be crowned prior to your arrival?)

# Patients

- What is the number of active patients? (Seen in the last 18 months)
- How many patients have had 2-3 prophyl/perio maintenance in the last 18 months?
- How many new patients per month?
---
# Has the practice been net positive or negative on active patients? (Growing or shrinking practice?)

# Legal Issues

- Is the seller set up as a PC, LLC, or C-Corp?
- Are there any existing liens against the business?
- Any liens against the building?
- Any pending malpractice lawsuits?
- Any other legal liabilities?

# Valuations Recap and Final Points

After reviewing all three valuation methods, it is important to recap the methodology and go through the thinking behind how the appropriate value was derived: For most practices, the EBITDA method will work and give you an approximate value that will be a good starting point for negotiations. This will be based on the dental practice's effectiveness as a business, and will give you assurance that you will be able to provide the necessary cash flow to pay the debt even after paying yourself. When the EBITDA method comes up with a valuation that seems extremely irregular; however, then you must also calculate the valuation from one of these other two methods to come up with an amalgamated value based on multiple methods.

As you start to come to the final valuation of the practice, remember two important points about purchasing a business. First is that you should only pay for the business as it is situated right now; not based on the potential that the business has. For example, a broker might say: "The area is really growing; we know that once you step in you'll be able to really hit it out of the park." While this might be true, you cannot pay more for an asset because it might be worth more in your hands. You should only pay what it is worth today, and for how the business was operated in the seller's possession.

Secondly, you will always need to do some improvements once you take ownership. That could be something small like just some paint on the walls or it could be a major equipment upgrade like a server, digital X-rays, and CBCT. In either case, you will want to use this 'upgrade cost' as a tool to try to lower the price of the practice. As negotiations proceed, you must continually point out, both in your mind and the seller's, that the practice isn't usable by you until you get certain aspects fixed.

In the end, remember that your valuation method is just a starting point for negotiations. The seller's valuation is also their starting point: The valuation you put together at this stage is not a locked number; and the seller may push against your value and try to bring it closer to what they have the practice offered at. In these cases, you must be confident in your methodology and support your calculated value with as much data as possible. In many negotiations that we have seen, a valuation is much more likely to be acceptable to a seller when the value is backed by strong data and less based on a potential or emotional attachment.

# Negotiation

Negotiating the sale of a business that has been the lifeblood of a dentist for years or decades can be an emotional decision and one that is not based on numbers. The picture of the ideal buyer in their mind may be someone who is just like them and wants to run the practice just like they have over the past 35 years. Since this is not likely to happen; no matter how the negotiation plays out, some level of calibration of expectations may need to be facilitated by the broker to the seller; or from the buyer to the seller.

This complicated process can be short; or extremely drawn out, depending on the circumstances. Remember however; that if this is a practice you want to purchase, that there are a few rules in relationships to keep in mind that might help the seller feel more comfortable with you, even if your price is not what they had hoped for: Just as with any friendship, most positive seller-buyer relationships are based on a formula that has been written about called the 'Friendship Formula'.

Friendship = Proximity x (Frequency + Duration) x Intensity

In the case of negotiations with a seller; it's a good idea to be as much their friend as their buyer. Looking at this formula; it is important to remember that you will want to play off the major factors in the formula to make sure they feel good about selling to you, rather than someone else. If they 'like' you, then they are likely to be more willing to reduce their asking price in order to come to an agreement with you, rather than hold out and sell for a bit more money to someone they have no relationship with, or possibly even dislike.

After you have developed a relationship with them and have gotten a firm handle on the value of the practice, then you are ready to make an offer. During this process it is best to physically sit in the same room with the seller; or at a minimum have a phone call with their representative and discuss factors that went into your valuation. Try to deliver the offer in both written and verbal format, because the broker or representative might not convey your exact statements to the seller unless it is specifically laid out in the most detailed format possible.

It is not a good idea to approach the negotiation by disparaging the seller's practice. Even if the walls are orange and they use silver points for endodontics, you have to find many things to compliment about the business. Remember; the end goal is to come to a mutual agreement on price that works for both parties. It cannot be said strongly enough- there will likely be a great deal of emotion for the seller. If an offer comes in substantially lower than the list price, the seller may come to the conclusion that; "this buyer is trying to low-ball me and doesn't respect the business I've built." This is a common reaction among sellers, and to be honest; we have been on both sides of the table. We have sold practices and were insulted by the initial offer from a potential buyer. If you do this for long enough; this is bound to happen. For this reason, suggest that any time an offer is made in writing, verbally; that you include the following:
---
Recap of their asking price and thank them for giving you the opportunity to make an offer; and for providing thorough data

Your methodology and your data to support it

Possible communications with your banker/financing institution to back up your position

Positives about their practice which you love

Apologize that this offer isn't what they were expecting; but express the hope that you and the seller can come to an agreement
---
Here is a sample letter from a buyer trying to negotiate down a practice from $625,000 to a lower price:

John (the broker),

Thank you for getting me the prospectus packet of information, it looks like Dr. Seller has built up a loyal patient base over the past 35 years.

I wanted to keep this process moving forward quickly, and so spoke with Susie at ABC Bank today, she was very informative. Her and I both shared concerns over the cash flow and debt service after normalizing the P&Ls:

I have been running the analytics and I'm not coming up with the same value as you propose. The EBITDA on the office is too low to use a multiple that would allow me to use that as a proper valuation method. Even after normalization, I couldn't arrive at the number that Dr. Seller is hoping for. For this reason, I moved onto a mixture of a few other widely utilized methodologies: Using a mix of fixed assets and percentage of revenues, I came up with a valuation range for the practice between $449k and $517k. I understand the asking price is higher and my goal is NOT to insult Dr. Seller; I respect what he has built and I believe there is great opportunity in his practice. However, after speaking with Lori at the bank and my own valuation methods, I believe that the practice numbers support this valuation pricing range.

I would love to discuss this further with you and receive your feedback.

Best,

Dr. Buyer

Hopefully the seller and broker respond favorably to this start of the negotiation, but do not be put off if the seller takes offense and decides to stop communicating for a few days. Oftentimes the role of the broker in this scenario is to have the price be as high as possible. Therefore, the broker will most often try to solicit purchase offers from interested parties before coming back to negotiate with you.

Depending on whether it is a buyer's market or seller's market; the process timeline can vary greatly: An agreement can be reached in an hour; or the negotiation could drag on for months: Remember; once the price is agreed upon, this is only the first step. As the negotiation continues to play out, remember the friendship formula as well as the fact that many deals just do not work out for one reason or another:

As negotiations proceed, remember that a broker will usually ask you to sign a letter of intent (LOI): This is a non-binding letter that provides the buyer a chance to fully do any due diligence on the practice prior to signing a 'purchase agreement' which will then close at a certain point in the future. The letter of intent usually binds the seller to not accept or entertain any other offers, while it gives the buyer a chance to look for any factors that might significantly impact the practice valuation or sale timeline. This period of time also gives the buyer the ability to finalize financing and all the paperwork together:

Here's an interesting psychological factor to consider: After the time when an LOI is signed, a buyer will often unconsciously begin to believe that their business is 'sold'. Having even the smallest amount of evidence that someone is interested in buying their business often creates a belief that they are close to the finish line. It is during this due diligence period that you, as the buyer, should be looking for any odd facts or mitigating factors that might cause you to change your offer to a lower amount: It also gives you a chance to start to negotiate some of the other factors that go into a practice sale including the allocation of assets, non-compete clause, and the accounts receivable. While changing the deal at the '11th hour' is typically frowned upon in negotiations, remember that the closer you are to the finish line, the more willing the seller might be to accept something that they would have considered impossible at the beginning of negotiations.

# Taxes, Depreciation and Allocation of Assets

The next step in the sale is the negotiation of the percentage of the sales price allocated to fixed assets, 'blue sky' and the non-compete clause. This is important to discuss because it has different tax implications for the buyer and seller: Fixed assets are often called FF&E; for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. These are the things that could be carried out the door to a new location if you left a space. They can often be depreciated very quickly for tax purposes under current tax law: 'Blue Sky' or 'Goodwill' of the business is typically the patient charts and intangibles of the business: The Non-compete is usually also assigned a value in the business operations. Each of these categories has different tax implications.

The buyer and seller should come to an agreement on which percentage allocation is given to equipment; which can usually be between 10-40% of the practice price. In certain situations, if
---
For instance, if a practice is distressed, or has been unoccupied for several months, this percentage can approach 90%. FF&E also includes all the dental supplies and office supplies as well: If there are many computers or digital sensors, this would increase the percentage allocated to this.

It is advantageous for the seller to keep this amount as low as possible since the previous owner most likely already depreciated this asset down in value. They will have to pay a higher tax rate on this amount. For the buyer, it is desirable to set this as high as reasonably possible.

At the time of sale, there should be two addenda to the contract. Addendum A should include all FF&E that is included in the sale. This list of included assets should be relatively exhaustive, but it doesn't need to go down to the serial numbers on each chair or handpiece. Addendum B should list anything that is not included in the sale. Some selling doctors want to take artwork or items that may have sentimental value to them. Identifying items like this can avoid having problems at the time of sale or immediately thereafter.

'Blue Sky' or goodwill, is the value of the active patients within the practice. This is often the largest allocation of the purchase price, as this is really where much of the value resides. For a seller, it is always better to have most of the value allocated to blue sky, as this is taxed at a lower rate for the seller. The buyer then has to amortize this cost over many years, which is not advantageous for the buyer. Arriving at this figure is a negotiation and there is no mathematical way to prove the value of 'Blue Sky.'

The last portion of the allocation price is the value to be assigned to a non-compete clause. Usually, this is $5,000 to $15,000. If you are worried about a selling doctor going back into practice, it is a good idea to have a lawyer write up a good non-compete clause. This clause can be very lenient or more stringent. One common type of non-compete clause assigns a value of $4,000 to each patient of record. "Patient of record" is usually defined as someone who has been seen in the last 18 to 24 months. If the selling doctor was to move down the street and see that patient, the selling doctor would have to pay the buyer $4,000 each time a former patient was seen. The value of the clause is tax favorable for the buyer, not the seller.

# Next are a few examples of the allocations in recent sales:

|Ex|Total Price|Annual Revenue|FF&E|Goodwill|Non-Compete|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|$675,000|$900k|$170,000|$500,000|$5,000|
|2|$175,000|$320k|$25,000|$150,000|$0|
|3|$190,000|$360k| | | |
---
# Key Points on Taxes and Depreciation

Once the allocations have been negotiated and agreed upon, they should be explicitly stated in the contract in a table. This is very important because when closing occurs, both parties will have to sign the IRS Form 8594 to let the IRS know that everyone was in agreement. This allows the IRS to appropriate deductions per party:

|FF&amp;E|$70,000|
|---|---|
|Goodwill|$110,000|
|Non-Compete|$10,000|

# Maximize Depreciation

Depreciation is the "reduction in the value of an asset with the passage of time, due in particular to wear and tear." This can either be in reference to the tax side of depreciation or the actual operational wear and tear on any asset. After you purchase an asset, you can usually use a depreciation table to figure out how much value the asset lost in any given year. Remember that this depreciation amount reduces net income, and thereby reduces tax liability. It is not real money, only a line item that helps with taxes.

Let's assume you buy a piece of equipment; a Cone Beam-CT machine, for $47,000. A high-tech piece of equipment like this is usually almost obsolete in 3 to 5 years. Due to this fact, the IRS will usually allow you to say that the asset lost value over the course of either 3 or 5 years. Your accountant will be able to help classify this cost; but in general, you want to depreciate it as fast as possible.

# Depreciation Rate

|Year|Property Half-year Convention|3-Year|5-Year|7-Year|10-Year|15-Year|20-Year|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|33.33%|20.00%|14.29%|10.00%|5.00%|3.750%| |
| |2|44.45%|32.00%|24.40%|18.00%|9.50%|7.219%|
| |3|14.81%|19.20%|17.49%|14.40%|8.55%|6.667%|
|4|7.41%|11.52%|12.49%|11.52%|7.70%|6.177%| |
|5| |11.52%|8.93%|9.22%|6.93%|5.713%| |
| |6| |5.76%|8.92%|7.37%|6.23%|5.285%|
|7| |8.93%|6.55%|5.90%|4.88%| | |
|8| |4.46%|6.55%|5.90%|4.522%| | |

# Internal Revenue Service, 2021

In recent years, Congress has almost always instituted Section 179. Sec. 179 of the tax code allows for any purchase up to $250,000 to be depreciated all in one year: Typically, if you buy a piece of equipment with the profits from a given year; you then have to pay your normal tax rate on those profits first. So, let's say you made $100,000 in profits in a given year: After taxes take 38%, you then have only $62,000 to potentially buy any assets.

However, if Sec. 179 is in place during that particular tax year; you will be able to claim any depreciation, totaling up to $250,000, all in one year. So if you purchased a CBCT, and you depreciate the entire amount in a single year; you avoid paying the $17,860 in taxes on that $47,000. It is as if the US Federal Government will purchase for you about 40% of any new equipment up to $250,000 during a single year.

So, in general, if you spend less than $250,000 on equipment during a single year; then you will be able to take the entire cost of the equipment as a tax loss. If you spend more than $250,000, then you will have to refer to the original percentage on the depreciation schedule in the table noted previously:

# Real Estate Depreciation

Many times dentists will own their real estate as well as their practice. Most tax planning professionals will say that a piece of commercial real estate will depreciate over 39.5 years. To calculate this depreciation, make sure you separate the value of the building from the value of the land. The IRS legally says that the land is not depreciable, but that the building will depreciate fully over 39.5 years. That means that every year; you will take 2.53% depreciation over the course of 39.5 years.
---
Let's say that a property was purchased for $250,000. The land is worth $100,000 and the building is worth $150,000. For every year for the life of the building; and on the building portion, or $53,795 per year: you can take a 2.53% loss.

A method to accelerate depreciation is to ask your accountant for a segregation study: In a segregation study, your accountant or tax advisor will take your building and divide its value into sub-categories like:

- Site Work
- Concrete & Masonry: Sidewalks, foundation
- Steel: Shell of the building
- Woods & Plastics: Finish woodwork, cabinetry, rough carpentry
- Thermal & Moisture Protection: Roofing, insulation, Doors & Windows
- Specialties: Dental cabinetry, dental lighting, restrooms, lockers
- Finish: Carpet; paint
- Mechanical
- Electrical

After you have a segregation study completed, you can then depreciate some of these areas faster than the 39.5 years. Items like the Electrical can potentially be depreciated in 15 years. Carpet and paint will wear out in 5 to 7 years. In this scenario, you can accelerate the depreciation schedule to get more depreciation in the early years of property ownership. This means more money in your pocket in the early years of property ownership.

# Accounts Receivable

A common question when a selling doctor leaves a practice is whether they should hold onto any monies owed to them. Accounts Receivable (AR) are the totality of debts owed to the previous business by patients and insurers who are in the process of paying: There are three options for the AR:

- Purchase the AR
- Seller retains AR and buyer services it
- Seller retains AR and either services it themselves, or hires a 3rd party to do so

# Purchase the AR

If the buyer purchases the AR, there should be a 'discount' applied to the amount due. Obviously many patients who felt obligated to pay their retiring doctor may not feel the same way towards the new owner. This change in ownership may give that patient the impression that they can stop paying. The other reason to pay a reduced fee on the AR is that it is going to cost the new owner time, postage, energy to go after these people who, for one reason or another; were slow to pay the retiring/selling doctor.
---
If you do purchase the AR, look closely at as many of the accounts as possible to know which discount percentages to assign to them: In general, here is a rule:

|0-30 Days:|Pay 85%|
|---|---|
|31-60 Days:|Pay 80%|
|61-90 Days:|Pay 50%|
|Over 90 Days:|Pay 30%|

This is an average allocation of percentages and can be modulated depending on the circumstances and the goodwill that you think patients owe the selling doctor: When servicing this debt; it should appear that all debts are still being paid to the selling doctor: Letters should continue to come from the former dental practice, and patients should feel as though they are still paying the selling doctor monies owed to him or her:

You can modulate the percentages based on historical trends, they are available from the selling doctor: If the doctor has a very tight collections policy; maybe these percentages rise up towards 90% or 93% on the 0-30 Day AR: If the seller has a poor collections policy, with it taking more than 45 days to collect any money; it might be better to move towards 80% or less.

The only advantage to this option is that all the collections that come in the door from day one go into the buyer's pocket: While there is an upfront cost to purchasing the AR, the ease of having cash-flow from the beginning is a good place to start. When financing; the bank will usually help with the entire cost so the entire loan amount will include this AR; So even though you are paying interest on this, it can sometimes decrease the headaches that come with slow cash-flow and transitions.

In some cases, selling doctors may feel slighted if they feel this is a 'low-ball' number: If this is the case, you might consider the next option:

# Seller Retains AR and Buyer Services It

In this option, the selling doctor maintains control and ownership of the AR. The Buyer then services it under the control of the purchased dental practice. In this case, it still appears that all debts are being paid to the dental practice and the selling doctor: The only difference is that after the money comes in, the purchaser transfers the payments to the seller:

If you choose to go this route, it is important to include in the selling document a few 'rules of engagement':

- Limits on Actions: The buyer and seller should maintain and limit how aggressive they want to be in pursuing these accounts. There should be agreement that if an account is sent to a collection agency; that both parties are aware and informed of this fact.
- First-In Money: If a patient owes money to a selling doctor and then gets service done with the new doctor; where does the first-in money go? Buyer and seller should agree on this scenario, but it usually means that the seller gets paid for what is owed to them first.
---
# 3. Collections Fee

After a certain number of days, either 30 or 45, a 10-20% fee is assessed on all collections for the selling doctor: This way; the money that is already in the pipeline, either from insurance or checks in the mail, will go 100% to the selling doctor. Any money that comes in after that date requires some work by the buyer: In this case, the buyer should get paid a reasonable percentage for the work to collect that money.

# End Date

After a certain date it will become a nuisance to continue to maintain the seller's accounts. The remaining amount is typically very small. The buyer and seller should agree on an endpoint to the collections so that there isn't an infinite timeline. Usually 6 months is appropriate. At that point, any accounts could be purchased out for a large discount; maybe 10-15% of the amount.

The only downside to collecting for a selling doctor is that there is a lot of energy associated with collecting and splitting out payments if you have a busy practice. Sometimes this can eat up a lot of energy from a staff that is already stressed by the change in ownership. Setting the ground rules from the beginning can ease a lot of the stress, and ensure that there isn't any ill will between the parties after the sale.

# Seller Retains AR and Services it

In this case, the seller will retain the AR. Sometimes a retiring dentist will take their book of accounts home and do it themselves, but more often their accountant will take care of it for them. Usually many patients will still mail checks to the practice or come to the practice to pay. In this case, you can keep a separate box for all payments, and then send this to the seller or their accountant, as warranted.

There are many other small, but important, details to address in the sale or purchase of a practice. It is always a good idea to engage a knowledgeable legal team to help you address these issues.

# Real Estate & Leases

In many cases the real estate comes with the practice or is at least possibly part of the sale of the business. In these cases, the negotiations are for both entities simultaneously. Usually the seller will have a rough valuation, or possibly an appraisal of the building.

Appraisals are usually done by a certified appraiser, who has to show their work and come up with a valuation based on real math without any emotion involved. This can be good in many cases for a bank loan or tax valuation; however, when a seller gets an appraisal, they may ask the appraiser to find the highest possible value that has data to back it up. In these cases, the value may come back higher than expected due to the appraiser using comparables and justifications that are on the high end of the spectrum. If this occurs, it's important to counter with your own data showing more accurate comparables and data. This can be one way to bring the value to a more reasonable level.
---
It is also important to remember that when packaging the entire sale together into one lump sum, it can be more psychologically fulfilling for the seller: Look at the example below:

S400,000 for the Dental Practice, S700,000 for the Real Estate
Vs
S1.1 Million for your business
Even though they are mathematically the same, there is a psychological effect that has been described by Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman and his partner Amos Tversky that state that the larger number will have a greater effect on your brain, even though they are mathematically the exact same. Taking advantage of this psychological bias might help you when you make an offer: So, make sure to always talk in 'big' numbers.

# Evaluating Real Estate

When purchasing real estate it is important to have a firm understanding of what you are buying. During a house purchase, most banks will want an inspection of the property to verify the structural integrity; electrical integrity, plumbing quality and general state of the house. In some cases when they find severe deficiencies, the bank will make sure all problems are fixed prior to closing so that they are not lending on a house that might turn out to be a 'lemon'.

In commercial real estate, it is also a good idea to go through a similar process, albeit sometimes more complicated. One of the first inspections that can be performed is a general inspection from a home inspection company: You might need to call a few inspectors to find one comfortable doing a commercial inspection, but it is not typically very difficult: In these cases an inspection can cost a few hundred dollars and they will identify any simple to moderate issues with a building.

In some cases when an inspector finds an issue, additional experts might need to be called in to review the findings. This might include structural engineers or contractors to see what might need to be fixed, the process necessary and the cost.

The next few items are inspections that may or may not be needed depending on how detailed you want to be in your research: The first is a Phase Environmental Site Assessment, commonly referred to as an ESA, or Phase ESA. This is completed to research the current and historical uses of a property as part of a commercial real estate transaction. The intent of the report is to assess if current or historical property uses have impacted the soil or groundwater beneath the property and could pose a threat to the environment and/or human health. If these issues are found, it presents a potential liability for the lender and/or owner; as well as affecting the value of the property. In the past some issues that we have seen are if the property had historical uses such as dry cleaners, gas stations, automotive repair, printing operations, and manufacturing.
---
# A Phase ESA typically includes the following:

- A site visit to observe current and past conditions and uses of the property adjacent properties.
- A review of federal, state, tribal, and local regulatory databases including, but not limited to, underground storage tanks, aboveground storage tanks, known or suspected release cases, the storage of hazardous substances and disposal of hazardous wastes including petroleum products, and institutional and engineering controls.
- A review of historical records, such as historical aerial photographs, fire insurance maps, historical city directories, and historical topographic maps.
- A review of state and local agency records, including but not limited to state environmental agencies, Building Departments, Fire Departments, and Health Departments.
- Sometimes it includes interviews with current and past property owners, operators, and occupants, or others familiar with the property.
- Sometimes it also includes interviews with the Report User for title or judicial records for environmental liens and activity use limitations.

This research is evaluated by the Environmental Professional to identify potential environmental risks to the property such as current or historic operations that are known or suspected to have used hazardous substances or petroleum products during onsite operations.

While not part of ASTM requirements, Phase ESA reports typically include a discussion of observed suspected asbestos, potential lead-based paint, and mold growth; as well as the potential for lead in drinking water and radon. Sampling for these non-ASTM concerns is beyond the scope of a standard Phase ESA, but can be included upon request.

A recognized environmental condition, some sort of problem, indicates known contamination or the potential for the subsurface to have been impacted by contamination (either from the subject property or possibly from an offsite source). The identification of any of these problems will often include a recommendation for a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to collect soil, groundwater, and/or soil vapor samples from the subsurface to analyze for the presence of contamination.

A Phase II ESA will often cost a bit more, typically between $5,000 and $10,000 depending on what needs to be assessed and the size of the property. Typically this is only done if problems are found in a Phase I study.

Once you are sure your property is free of any problems and passes both an inspection and test, then you should be good to purchase the property with some assurances that it will be a good deal for you in the long term.

# Taking over a Lease

In some cases, you will be taking over a lease from the selling doctor: In this scenario you will want to have your legal counsel look over the lease contract very closely.
---
# Here are some important points to consider when reviewing a lease:

# Types of Leases

- Gross Rent Lease: one amount for all rent and incidentals, single monthly amount
- Modified Gross Rent: landlord and tenant share a portion of all expenses
- Net Leases: rent goes to landlord, then tenant pays all other incidentals
- Triple Net (NNN) = tenant pays all taxes, insurance, and maintenance on building
- Percentage Rent Lease: tenant pays base rent then a percentage of sales over time (common in mall scenarios)

# Lease Notes for Acquisitions:

- Know exactly what the existing rent was, impacting the profitability of the practice
- Know what future rents will be; this can have a huge impact on business valuation
- Have a clause for 'First Right-of-refusal' to purchase the building, or try to include one when signing a longer lease
- Sometimes the seller can get this from a landlord before they then sell it to you
- Probably want to try to negotiate a new lease if possible
- Seller might be able to negotiate a better lease before sale, which then goes to your benefit: You can always suggest a good lease
- Triple Net costs are usually not negotiable
- Will make sure tenant has ability to audit the costs on the 'common fees'

# Biggest Negotiation Failures:

- Landlord with 30 days notice can move a tenant into a 'similar space' within the shopping center
- Landlord requires certain working hours
- Mechanics liens: tenant has a right to work around any liens from contractors (Bonding around a lien)

# Negotiating other points:

- When to return a security deposit?
- Ask for specific inflator on the % so that you can know the exact cost over the life of the lease
- Try to get a 10 year lease with 2 x (5 year options) so that you can amortize your investment over 20 years; even to have the option for more is a good idea
- Ask for Latent Defect protection - landlord would pay for any defects that come to light in the building after tenant already moved in (ie. foundation, roof, etc)
- Even mid-lease you can hire a re-negotiator to help
- When re-negotiating, you'll need about 12 months lead time prior to termination to fully negotiate the lease
---
Just because neighbor is paying S2O/NNN doesn't mean you should be paying that. each tenant is individual. You need your own broker in any project; do not just call up the name on the sign, it is NOT a do-it-yourself project.

# Top Items NEED in your Lease:

- Always negotiate a 'cap' on lease net costs (maintenance, insurance).
- Never let a landlord require/limit certain working hours.
- Always get Latent Defect protection - make sure any structural issues won't be your responsibility to fix.
- Know the exact inflators over the life of the lease.
- Get your security deposit back after a few years.
- Always maintain the ability to audit the Triple Net Costs.
- If you sell the practice, make sure your lease holds over to the next person.
- Make sure your landlord can't move you to another 'similar' spot.
- Review lease termination/renegotiation conditions if your strip center or location goes into foreclosure (Security Non-Disturbance Clause).
- Ownership change of building doesn't break the lease.

One of the biggest keys we can encourage at this point is to have professional representation when negotiating leases. There are many real estate professionals across the country who specialize in lease negotiations. They will help you navigate the waters from start to finish, and hopefully avoid a potentially disastrous situation down the road. They can also lessen your legal bill as they will work through any lease contracts on your behalf.

It might be tempting to avoid this, but remember that lease negotiators actually do not cost you any money: In almost all situations they get a cut from the landlord or the landlord's leasing agent - which is typical of the real estate industry: So, they are free to you, and help you get better terms in the end.

# Due Diligence Pays Off

According to Perrin DesPortes of Polaris Healthcare Partners, Due Diligence is one of the most important times in the acquisition process. After negotiating the final price and details of the practice acquisition, you will go into a time of 'due diligence'. This is typically 60-90 days and includes time to get all the paperwork drafted, financing in place, and other details wrapped up.

# There are 3 main parts to the Due Diligence process:

- Clinical
- Financial
- Operational
---
# Clinical

Evaluating the clinical quality and charts of the selling doctor is very important. You will want to audit the clinical charts and records for both integrity as well as understanding the overall treatment philosophy of the selling dentist. As you evaluate, you will want to look for over-treatment and under-treatment; according to the standards that you think are typical for your treatment philosophy: To accomplish this, we suggest setting aside a few hours and reviewing many charts randomly to fully assess the quality and types of treatment that the selling doctor performed.

In each chart ensure that the seller is:

- Charting appropriately and taking notes appropriately
- Billing to payer source appropriately
- Taking appropriate radiographs in a timely manner
- Treating periodontal disease appropriately

To adequately evaluate the clinical side, we suggest that you either pull paper charts, or print off a list of active patients and alphabetically choose every so many patients. One DSN user recommended that you pull every 5th chart; either digitally or in paper format. As you review these charts, we suggest you use a spreadsheet to keep track of the age of the patient; insurance payer type, active versus inactive, and what treatment was done recently:

# Financial

You will want to make sure that the financial performance of the business is exactly what the seller claims it to be over the previous 24-36 months. This includes going through a few steps, but most often means matching up the federal tax returns with their profit and loss statements. In the cases where you think there might be discrepancies, you can always hire a 3rd party accounting firm to do a review; which is sometimes called a "Quality of Earnings Report". This can sometimes cost between $50,000 and $200,000, depending on the size and complexity of the acquisition. This makes it infeasible for most acquisitions, but large Dental Service Organizations might do this when buying larger clinics.

There's a few large things to take into account when reviewing the finances of an acquisition. First is to make sure it is well understood whether the seller is using "cash" versus "accrual" accounting methods in their reporting: This can swing revenue and cost numbers between months, and should be stated on the top of any financial reports printed from a software like Quickbooks. Second is that some practices now use in-house membership plans. Plans like this, as well as in-house financing, can often create difficulties in determining Accounts Receivable, as well as true revenue that should have been accounted for. Sometimes different types of treatment also stretches out finances over time and can create odd numbers in the accounts receivable. Orthodontics is the largest service that creates discrepancies, and so we recommend evaluating the AR on Orthodontics separately:
---
In the case where the seller might have discrepancies or errors in their original numbers, there will need to be discussion around changing the sales price to reflect the most accurate valuation. This changing transaction amount will most often be a negotiation, and this might terminate the acquisition in some circumstances. If all parties agree on a new valuation and price, then things can move forward: If you come to a different value than the seller and there is no agreement; then it is absolutely acceptable to walk away from the deal. It is much better to avoid a bad deal, than to try to buy the average dental practice that might give you more problems over the next few years.

# Operational

While the buyer may change many things about the dental practice after the acquisition, it is important to understand the system and processes of the business. This also includes evaluating all the equipment, software, and technology of the practice. Many of these things are discussed later in this book:

# Wrapping up Valuation and Negotiations

By this point in the process, you have identified a good market; prepared all the financial statements, found a seller; audited their charts and office equipment, negotiated many of the points of the deal. It might feel very satisfying; but we will warn you that you still have a ways to go before the office keys get handed to you:

As you continue in the process, the next stage is finalizing all the contracts. Remember that this is still an extension of the negotiation process, which could possibly take months. The next pages will give you all the legal documents and advice to come up with the most advantageous ways to set up your new business to take over this seller's business in a legal, safe and efficient manner:

# Legal and Contracts

The next stage in the journey includes all of the legal questions that arise when buying a business. Whether you are buying or starting a dental practice from scratch, you will need the very best professional advice. The importance of having good lawyers and accountants cannot be understated. Finding a team that specializes in dental transactions can be difficult or time-consuming; but the special knowledge they bring can save hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road. Check with a local attorney for regulations in your state, as many state laws dictate the best course strategy:

After the preliminary negotiations are in full force, the next stage starts when the buyer and seller tentatively agree to work together to come to a sale agreement. This agreement is referred to in document form as a Letter of Intent, or LOI: The LOI is usually very short and simple, and basically only refers to the willingness of the parties to negotiate with each other: it will normally include parts that stipulate that the seller should not try to deal with anyone else. Once the seller 'accepts' or signs the LOI, that usually gives 30-60 days of negotiation and due diligence. During that period, hopefully the parties can come to agreements on all the terms of the deal. For that, sometimes the seller will actually require an 'earnest money deposit', but that is more common in the general business world than in the dental industry:

In an LOI, there are usually contingencies as well: Contingencies are things that have to happen in order for the LOI to remain valid while leading to a purchase agreement. The most common contingency is that the buyer can get financing for the business acquisition. In the case where a bank says, 'We will not lend you the money', the buyer is relinquished from the agreement and does not have to go through with any purchase. This can happen sometimes, but if you have gone through the steps listed earlier in the book, then you will not usually have this contingency to worry about.

After the LOI is signed, the clock starts ticking for you to negotiate the final points of the deal, and to get your own business operations set up. It is at this stage that you should get your own attorney involved with the process to both help you set up your own entity; and negotiate the final purchase agreements. At this point; we will go through setting up your own entity:

86
---
# Setting Up Your Corporation

# Limited Liability Corporation

Most dental offices should be established as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), filing taxes as an S Corporation: While this is normally the case, some states will require a Professional Corporation, or PC. California is specifically this way, so in this case you will be a PC filing taxes as an S-Corp. In both of these cases, this means that the practice is formed as a closely held corporation that passes through all income, or losses, to its shareholders. In both scenarios, the owners claim the income on their personal income tax forms and pay tax at the personal income rate. To be an S Corporation, you must:

- Have no more than 100 shareholders
- All Shareholders are individual persons
- Have only one class of stock

When forming an LLC or PC, you will need a legal team to apply for a name, draft all documents and assign stock membership to any owners. If it is just a one-person company; then that one owner owns 100% of the stock.

Your first PC or LLC will own the dental business. This can be named the same as your dental practice, it is basically your main company: and you may also want a second LLC for any real estate you own. You will want to form this LLC and pay yourself market-rate rent from your dental business into this LLC. This structure provides a firewall against any unwanted legal troubles. If someone slips and hurts themselves on the sidewalk they can sue the property LLC, but it will be harder to sue the dental business. It also serves as protection the other way: if someone sues your dental practice, they will have a harder time gaining access to any of your property income when the property is in a different LLC. Another advantage is that tax law is favorable towards property; which you should discuss with your CPA.

# C Corporation

A C-Corporation is an entity where the income is taxed at the corporation level, and not passed through to the personal level. So after the business makes or loses money, it is taxed before being distributed as dividends. This usually presents a poor value proposition for any dental practices, as you will pay taxes twice before getting to take any money home. The first tax is the corporate profit tax, and if you pay out dividends to shareholders, it is taxed a second time at a different rate. It is for this reason that the C-Corp is almost never used and should be avoided in dentistry: Check with your tax advisor however; as tax laws change frequently.
---
# Getting Close to the Finish Line

If it looks like your due diligence period is promising and both parties are working towards an agreement; you will most likely start to work on a contract that fulfills all of the specifics of the deal that you are anticipating: All of the details regarding the practice are then put into a purchase agreement: The purchase agreement is sometimes signed earlier in the process, with closing date further down the line. The closing date is the day when the money actually changes hands and the business entity is transferred to the new owner: However; sometimes all of the final paperwork is signed at the same time when money exchanges occur on closing day: Either process is acceptable.

The next documents we will share are sample purchase agreements. They vary in length significantly: While both do the job, using one versus the other depends on the preference of your legal team.

# Here are the documents we will share next, all of which can be found in the Document Vault found in the QR code folder:

- Short Asset Purchase Agreement
- IRS Form 8594 Example
- Long Asset Purchase Agreement
- Stock Purchase Agreement
- Real Estate Purchase Agreement
- Termination and Rehire Letter
- Closing Statement
- Associate Dentist Employment Agreement
- Real Estate Purchase Agreements
- Employment Agreement with Associate Doctors
- Termination and Rehire Agreements with Team

In all of the following documents we want to stress the importance of reading and thoroughly understanding every document you decide to use. We are not attorneys, and we are not dispensing legal advice. Attorneys are well trained at understanding all of the specifics of documents and the purchase of each, and it is extremely prudent not to try to do this without legal representation. Our advice is to read through all documents carefully; highlight areas that you do not completely understand, and then jump on a call with your attorney to discuss each of the points. Contracts are not meant to be a foreign language, but they can seem like it. Generally; they are designed to be a rulebook and guidebook for how the transaction should happen. If one or both parties do not understand the rules, contracts can be broken and expensive lawsuits can occur: The best practice is to avoid misunderstandings from the very beginning.

# RESTRICTIVE COVENANT:

In consideration of and in conjunction with the sale of the Practice, Covenantor hereby grants the following restrictive covenant (the "Restrictive Covenant").

Covenantor hereby individually covenants and agrees not to practice dentistry; in any location other than the Premises, as a private practitioner; partner; associate; contractor; employee or as a stockholder; officer or director of any corporation or organization so engaged, or lend Covenantor's name to any business organization competitive with the Practice, within COUNTY***** County, (the "Restricted Area") for a period beginning from the Date of Possession and continuing until three (3) years from the date Covenantor discontinues practicing dentistry on the Premises (the "Restricted Period").

Nothing herein stated shall be construed as prohibiting Purchaser from pursuing any other equitable remedy or remedies available for such breach or threatened breach, including recovery of damages from Covenantor or injunctive relief:

This Restrictive Covenant Agreement shall be considered a personal service agreement between Covenantor and Purchaser: Should Covenantor be in violation of this Restrictive Covenant then the Restricted Period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period during which said violation or violations occurred. If Purchaser seeks injunctive relief from said violation in court, then the running of the Restrictive Period shall be suspended during the pendency of said proceeding, including all appeals by Covenantor: This suspension shall cease upon the entry of a final judgment in the matter:

Covenantor agrees not to discuss any practice related policies and/or issues that may be considered a breach of professional standards by Purchaser with the staff, patients, and/or referral sources of the practice, either before, during or following the Restricted Period. Covenantor agrees that any differences that may arise relating to such policies and/or issues will be discussed only with Purchaser; or if necessary; with Covenantor's legal representative or as required by any legal and/or administrative procedure.

# NON-SOLICITATION:

As a further inducement to Purchaser to acquire the Practice Covenantor hereby warrants and agrees that; during the term of the Restricted Period, Covenantor; and/or any agent of Covenantor; will not solicit any of Covenantor's former patients of the Practice (those who have received treatment at any time during the 36 month period immediately preceding the last day Covenantor discontinues practicing dentistry on the Premises) to seek dental treatment in any other office other than that owned by the Purchaser: In addition:

During the Restricted Period, Covenantor (and/or any agent of Covenantor) agrees not to solicit any professional referral sources of the Practice, for any business that could otherwise be referred to Purchaser:

During the Restricted Period, Covenantor (and/or any agent of Covenantor) agrees not to recommend to any patients of the Practice to patronize any other practitioner (in the same fields of dental practice as Purchaser) other than Purchaser regardless of the distance of that patient's domicile from the Premises (unless that patient is relocating to another area outside of the Restricted Area).

During the Restricted Period, Covenantor (and/or any agent of Covenantor) agrees not to solicit, employ or contract with any of the employees of the Practice who were employed by Purchaser during the Restricted Period, to work for
---
anyone other than Purchaser:

If Covenantor will continue to practice dentistry in another location other than the Premises (if applicable), then Covenantors immediate family members (limited to grandparents, parents, siblings and children of both Covenantor and Covenantors spouse) shall not be included as patient for purposes of this patient non-solicitation:

# PATIENT REVENUE REIMBURSEMENT:

Covenantor acknowledges that Purchaser has given Covenantor valuable consideration for the purchase of the Practice and Covenantor's goodwill, which is directly associated with, and dependent upon the doctor-patient relationship established by Covenantor with the patients of the Practice. Covenantor further acknowledges and agrees that; because of Covenantor's long-term relationship with the patients of the Practice, significant number of these patients would very likely transfer to another office where Covenantor could elect to provide dental services to the public in the future (and/or any other dental practice where Covenantor is a principal), even if such office is located outside the Restricted Area and at time beyond the Restricted Period; therefore:

Since Purchaser has paid Covenantor valuable consideration for those patients and such payment was made in anticipation of future revenues for the Practice then Covenantor agrees that should Covenantor practice dentistry on any former patient of the Practice (or said patient was treated by another dentist associated with any other dental practice in which Covenantor is principal), at any location other than the Premises, either within or outside of the Restricted Area, for a period of 84 months following the date Covenantor discontinues practicing dentistry on the Premises, then Covenantor agrees to immediately pay to Purchaser the sum of THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED 00/100 DOLLARS ($3,500.00) for each former patient of the Practice so treated (except for immediate family members which are limited to grandparents, parents, siblings and children of both Covenantor and Covenantor's spouse, if applicable, as reimbursement for the loss of the potential future revenue that could have been paid to the Practice by that patient:

In addition, Covenantor acknowledges that Purchaser has paid Covenantor valuable consideration for the trained staff currently employed in the Practice at the time of the Closing, and that such trained staff is of considerable value to Purchaser: Therefore, should Covenantor employ one or more of Purchaser's employees to work in another office, either within or outside of the Restricted Area, for a period of 84 months following the date Covenantor discontinues practicing dentistry on the Premises, then Covenantor agrees to immediately pay to Purchaser the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($20,000.00) for each such former employee of the Practice hired by Covenantor; as reimbursement for the cost to Purchaser for hiring and training suitable replacement employee.

Covenantor agrees to pay the aforementioned reimbursement payment(s) to Purchaser within ten (10) days of the date Covenantor practiced dentistry on a former patient of the Practice, or (ii) said patient was treated by another dentist associated with any other dental practice in which Covenantor is a principal.
---
andlor (ii) Covenantor employed one or more of the aforementioned employees of the Practice. Failure by Covenantor to pay such required reimbursement payments within the aforementioned ten day period, shall result in the payment amount due being increased by one hundred percent (100%); however; the cumulative payments for reimbursement shall not exceed 100% of the total Purchase Price for the Practice (as described in the Asset Purchase Agreement) Covenantor acknowledges and agrees that the reimbursement payments are an incentive and are a specific condition for Purchaser acquiring and paying for the Practice. Both parties agree that the required reimbursement payments do not prohibit Covenantor from practicing dentistry on the former patients of the Practice or employing any of the employees of the Practice in another office, but merely reimburses Purchaser for any future lost revenues resulting from such patient transfers, andlor expenses associated with hiring and training replacement employees.

# WAIVER OF RIGHT TO PROTEST:

The restrictive covenants contained herein are ancillary to a sale of the Practice and are to be construed as cumulative with those set forth in any other agreements between the parties hereto. Covenantor expressly agrees that the duration, geographical limitations and description of the prohibited conduct described in this Restrictive Covenant Agreement are reasonable and that Covenantor has received valuable consideration for the warranties and covenants contained herein. Covenantor further expressly waives the right to protest the reasonableness of the limitations, warranties, geographical limitations and prohibited conduct specified in this Restrictive Covenant Agreement.

# SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE:

Any breach of the warranties and covenants contained herein shall be subject to specific performance by temporary as well as permanent injunction or other equitable remedies by a court of competent jurisdiction. The obtaining of any such injunction shall not prevent the obtaining party from also seeking and obtaining any damages incurred as a result of such breach, either prior to or after obtaining such injunction. If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that either party has breached any of the foregoing covenants, then that party shall pay all reasonable costs of enforcement of the foregoing covenants including, but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, including such costs and fees through any appeals.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Covenantor has executed this Restrictive Covenant Agreement on the aforementioned Signature Date.

WHEREAS, Seller is licensed to practice dentistry in the State of STATE**** and is engaged in the practice of general dentistry as an employee of and provides such services at (the "Premises");

WHEREAS, Purchaser is licensed to practice dentistry in the State of STATE****;

WHEREAS, this Agreement is a material and separately bargained for part of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated effective as of February 28, 2021 (the "Purchase Agreement") between Seller and Purchaser; whereby Seller sold all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to all of the outstanding and issued shares of the Practice (collectively, the "Shares"); and

WHEREAS, Seller acknowledges that Purchaser would not purchase the Shares unless Seller agrees to this Agreement.

THEREFORE, in consideration of good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, Seller warrants and covenants as follows:

Seller agrees she shall not, for a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date, within a ten (10) mile radius of the Premises, directly or indirectly: (a) own any interest in, (b) participate in the management, operation, or control of, or (c) perform any services as or act in the capacity of an employee or agent of any enterprise engaged in the practice of dentistry.

# Details in Purchase Agreements

As you read the previous first two purchase agreements, you will notice a few similarities and differences in each document: While the first one is short and to the point; the second one is much longer and addresses pretty much every contingency possible.

The third acquisition document is based around a 'stock sale'. This was drafted by our attorney for a specific sale of a practice whereby the seller wanted to pass along the loans, bank accounts, and corporation directly to the buyer. This is non-traditional for most transitions, but might work well for certain situations, including when the doctor wants to exit fast. This could be very typical for situations where a doctor is sick or has an immediate change in family situation.

Asset purchases are typically used because they limit any potential liabilities to the new owner; since the new owner is only buying assets and patient charts. Typically the risk in a stock sale is that the purchaser might 'buy' a liability. However, the stock purchase can be written with specific covenants that would protect the buyer from previous liabilities. We also introduce the concept of a bucket system, where the buyer is only liable for a certain dollar amount of damages before the seller picks up the rest or vice versa. This is a compromise when the seller wants to relieve themselves of future liabilities as well. The advantage is that this is a very fast transaction and the buyer simply takes over the corporation, licenses, bank accounts, and paperwork. The downside is the possible risks. In each of these scenarios, you should discuss the specific details, pros and cons with your attorney before making any decisions.

# Legalities of Employee Transition

Next we will address some employee documents. The first agreement includes a table at the end which includes all of the employees, their pay, benefits, and whether they would like to remain working for the next employer. While some sellers are quite open with the fact they are leaving; that is not always the case. If the seller is keeping the transition confidential, it is important to ascertain which employees will stay and which will resign. In most cases, you will want to retain most team members. However, you will need to decide whether to keep the existing team on board with your organization or whether to pick and choose who stays and who goes. Regardless, we encourage you to use the document found later in the book called 'Termination and Rehire letter'. This document helps to be extremely clear with each team member that they are no longer employed with their former company; and that they are a new employee with your company. We have used this document for years, and even though we are extremely clear with the expectations that they are new employees; there is still often some confusion. We have had employees approach us a year after the transition ask why they do not have more vacation time. It is during this time that we have to show them the document they signed at the time of the transition that shows them that they are a new employee with your company; and no longer employed by the previous owner.

The next documents we have are the Real Estate Purchase Agreement; then Termination and Rehire Letter; then a Closing Statement; Employment agreement; and Closing Checklist.

# Closing Statement

This document is great because at the end of the joint meeting when all of the contracts are finalized and signed, you will need to ensure that the money changes hands in a very simple and clear manner: The closing statement is the simplest version of that. Typically if the bank or buyer comes with a check, then the check is taped to the closing statement and then 2 extra photocopies are made. One photocopy is then given to each of the parties, and the check then goes home with the seller.

# Associate Dentist Employment Agreement

On certain occasions, the selling dentist is staying on with the new owner for a period of time to aid in the transition, or to wind down their last few working years with you as the owner/manager: In these scenarios, the dentist employment agreement is useful as a template to rehire the selling doctor: This sample agreement has both a clause about minimum base salary as well as percentage of production. Have your attorney work up whatever option is best for your scenario.

# Closing Checklist

One of the most helpful documents included in our acquisition legal paperwork is the closing checklist: On this checklist is every major point that needs to be discussed or signed on closing day: It also gives a place if something is not as expected on closing day; you can add it to the last section and get to it at a date of your choosing in the very near future. In our experience, this has been very helpful and useful as a way to keep the signing ceremony on track.

# Final Notes

It cannot be stated clearly enough that these documents are a guidepost for you as you proceed towards an acquisition. A good attorney can take these and edit as necessary to make them work in your situation, but it is never a good idea to do this without legal help. We hope that these have given you a good start to the process and will allow you less stress as you work towards the day you transition in as the new owner.

# Chapter 6

# Transition Day

Congratulations! You have found the right office to purchase in a location that you enjoy and where the economics work out well: You have negotiated an acceptable price, and now it's signing day: Prior to this you will think you have done a bunch of hard work, but trust us when we say the journey has only just begun. The truth is that the rubber meets the road the moment you sign the contract and the keys figuratively, and literally; handed over to you:

Now we will go through all the major items that will happen during the transition day and week; in a relatively time-appropriate order:

- Signing Process
- Meeting with the Team
- Transitioning the Team
- Communication with Patients

# Signing Process

Usually this happens at a bank, accountant's office, or title company when all available parties are present to sign documents, pass over keys, and accept or give payment for assets. This process is usually jubilant, and most of the time everyone is very excited to have consummated the deal. Usually by this point; the documents are all in order; but it's never a bad idea to be over-prepared. The documents in the previous chapter called 'Closing Checklist and Issues' is a great way to make sure everyone stays on the same page with everything that needs to be signed and completed prior to executing all documents.

# Meeting with the Team

Sometimes a selling doctor is very open with the team prior to the sale, and in these instances you will get to meet the team before closing. However; when this is not the case, you will only meet them after you own the business. At this time, the emotional stress of having the business sold can be a lot for the team, and so don't be surprised with a varying range of emotions.
---
Usually best if the selling doctor can actually set up a meeting with the team and introduce you to them. Whenever the first meeting occurs, either before or after the sale, it is always best to remember to be sensitive to the stress and uncertainty that the team is likely encountering:

# Rule #1: Bring the gift

The gift cannot totally change the situation, but is common courtesy and will help get you started on the right foot: The gift can either be food or something meaningful to give to each team member. Remember: You are now stepping into the shoes of the beloved former doctor; and that almost nothing will satisfy the normal human aversion to change.

During this first meeting you will want to balance the legal side of the meeting with the emotional side. Of course the former doctor will have to let all of the team know that they are now no longer employed by their former company: There will need to be paperwork distributed to them to inform them that they are now terminated, and potentially rehired by you. (The former employer/dentist should have paid them for their last time period as well as paid out all remaining benefits.)

On the personal side, they will want to know more about you: They will be interested in how you practice, what procedures you do, and the type of person you are. They will likely have many questions. This is understandable and expected. However, if they ask questions that you simply do not know the answer to yet: Write them down, and make sure to get back to them at a later date with an answer. They may also ask questions that you might not feel comfortable answering just yet. In these cases, set up a time to speak to the person asking the questions to address it privately. Usually a large team meeting is the best way to start the process, but usually it will also take individual meetings that first day to address all other concerns.

# Transitioning the Team

After the legal asset transition is complete it is up to you to handle the next steps from the legal perspective. In many cases, it is appropriate to rehire the entire group, therefore having some of the paperwork ready for that is necessary: You should have their 'Termination and Rehire Letter' covered in the previous chapter already filled out and ready to go. Hopefully each team member will sign it and are grateful to keep their jobs with your new entity, but of course this is not always the case. For a variety of different reasons, some employees may not accept your employment offer. These scenarios happen, it's part of doing business, so try not to take it personally.

There are also scenarios when it is best not to rehire anyone and to start fresh with a new team. When you are unsure who is worth retraining; it is best to meet with the team as a group first, and then quickly move to meet with each team member individually to assess whether they will fit your practice's vision. This process must be handled carefully as tensions are usually high once the 1-on-1 meetings begin: If you take this route, then after all terminated team members are gone, you can then have a more long-form meeting with the remaining team members.
---
There are also times when you might want to consider trial employment. In these cases you can announce that you are going to keep everyone on for 30 days to ascertain whether they will be a good match for the new culture. The narrative can sound something like,

“We truly want you all to stay and work out; but we know that not all team members will enjoy working in a new environment with new stressors and demands: And that's ok. Over the next 30 days, we will perform a working interview: At the end of the 30 days, we will then re-offer you a permanent position within the company if warranted. If the relationship between me as the employer and you as an employee isn't going to work out; we should know pretty quickly. Honestly, if it's not a good fit, we should end it as soon as possible so that we can help you find a place that is a better fit for you.

Truth is, there is usually a lot of turnover during an acquisition. Addressing the future turnover up front sets the stage for open communication and clear expectations. However you decide to handle your workforce during the transition, it is always wise to consult an HR company or labor attorney prior to letting anyone go.

Clarity is key during this transition. The big items to explain to the team are that they are no longer working for the former company; they have been terminated, and they are being offered new employment with your company. While it looks like the same office, with the same co-workers, and the practice might even have the same name, it is important to remind them many times that they are now part of a new company. You will have different benefits, different rules, and different expectations.

As they start new employment with you, you will want to give them the customary documents that you'd give any employee on their first day:

- Employee Handbook
- Job descriptions
- Onboarding Packets

Check out Dental Success Network's website, or the Dental Operations Manual by DSN, for full examples of the above documents. These documents, of course, will not be an exact match to what these employees do on a daily and weekly basis. This is understandable, and can be approached as follows:

“I know that this job description does not match your daily tasks identically; but please look it over and use it as a guide as to the format that we'd like to model your job description after: We can work together to create one specific to your position.”

Encouraging each team member to write their own job description and procedural frameworks is a powerful way to help them to take a little initiative, and see that their future job will be centered around accountability and checklists rather than pure top-down leadership.
---
Setting a tone of 'systemization' and accountability from day one might be a big departure from how they were led in the past, but it should be understood that this is how things will be structured going forward. To increase the likelihood of success as the new owner make sure to be empathetic to the change they are going through, and to connect with them on a personal level to better understand their concerns and motivations.

Below is an example of a Hygiene Onboarding packet: These types of documents will help your new employees understand the level of systemization that you wish to see, as well as your expectations for their position.

# Key Production Indicators (KPIs)

At Example Dental, we want to hold ourselves to an internal scorecard of being the BEST we can be. Aligning with our core values, we have a few KPIs that are important indicators of 'playing the game at a high level'

# Cheat Sheet for Hygiene (3.3X) @ 537 /Hr

| |Hrs|GOAL|
|---|---|---|
|WGs for 2021| |S872.14|
|Achieve 500 Google Reviews by End-of-Year 2021| |S1,046.57|
|1,200 New Patients for the year 2021| |S1,221.00|
|S1.5 Million in Revenue for 2021| |S1,395.43|
| |8.5|S1,482.64|
| | |S1,569.86|

# KPIs for Hygiene to help achieve these goals:

- Net production is 3.3X Hourly Wage
This takes hourly pay X 3.3X. If your hourly wage is S35/hour, your goal is to produce $115.50 per hour after all deductions. On average this is highly achievable with a typical prophy; exam, and 50% of patients taking BW or 2 PA, Fluoride helps as well.
- 90% of Patients getting Fluoride
Typically almost all patients can be helped by getting topical fluoride treatment if they fall into a moderate or high risk caries, or other applicable condition. Fluoride should be a recommended treatment.
- 90% of patients scheduled for their recare appointments
If patients aren't scheduled, they are likely to fall out of our practice and they may go for years. Getting an appointment on the books is of great importance.
- 85% Treatment Acceptance Rate
We are on the conservative side of the spectrum at Capital Dental. Treatment recommended by Doctors in the Urgent or Important Category need to be scheduled. Hygiene can help achieve this by educating patients about their condition to be an adjunct voice of the doctor.
- 5-Star Google Reviews & New Patients
Of course the highest recommendation from any patient is to send friends or give a nice Google Review. Hygienists can help by mentioning the giveaways that we have at each office for reviews. Also giving out wine, t-shirts, or other gifts can bring forth increased reviews or referrals.

# Personal Connections

Connecting with your team and letting them know that you care about their personal and professional development is an important aspect of building a strong culture. This can take a long time in normal daily experiences, but we accelerate the process by utilizing an activity that should take about an hour for a team of 6-12 people. We call it the "Focus on You" exercise.

# Here is the exercise:

1. Print a page for each team member; and give them a writing surface and allow them to complete the exercise.
2. You lead the activity with this direction:
- This exercise will help all of us get to know each other better; even for those who have known each other for years. For the next few minutes, please fill out the top line yourself quietly - Let's begin: like "In the top Line, fill out what you like to be called: Sometimes your name is Thomas, but you liked to be called Tom. And you might hate it if someone calls you Thomas or Tommy... SO write down exactly what you would like to be called. (Wait about 25 seconds)
- In the next line put what you get paid to do. This can be your job description, or really the true essence of what you do. (Wait about 45 seconds, or until everyone is done)
- In the next box, write down "Hot button" topics that you enjoy reading about, talking about or studying: This can be sports, hobbies, health, kids, etc. What is it that 'lights you up' and energizes you? (Wait about a minute, or until everyone is done)
- In the next box, write down one professional success and one personal success that you have achieved in your life. (Wait about a minute, or until everyone is done)
- In the next box, write down one or two things that you do best: This could be associated with work, or something outside the office. (Wait about a minute, or until everyone is done)
- In the next box, put two goals, one personal and one professional. This could be long or short term goal: (Wait about a minute, or until everyone is done)

After everyone has their top line filled out, you then pick someone to start with, maybe yourself: Read your answers aloud, and the others around the group will write down these answers onto their sheets. During the time when you are giving out your answers no one else should talk or interrupt; and when you are completed, they may ask any questions that they have about any of your answers.

As you go around the group, you will see that this activity gets you to know a lot about people's hobbies, their wins, their goals, and will hopefully allow you to connect with them at a deeper more personal level:

# Turnover

Realistically; you are likely to have a fair amount of staff turnover in the first 6 months of practice ownership: While the employees still come to the same building, they now have totally different expectations and a different boss. This stress and change usually leads to disaffection and people will look for a new start somewhere else. This is understandable and to be expected: Do your best to be prepared to onboard and train these employees to your systems, however know that even your best effort to keep them may still end in attrition.

After you have gotten your team up to speed with the new operational flow; the next step is to share the upgrades you have made with the patients. This will include a few things including:

- Letter to patients
- Email to patients
- Letter printed out and available at front desk
- Scripting with Patients to address changes

The following are a few of the sample letters you can use as a template when addressing the improvements. Remember that this letter is discussed in the legal contracts, and is often a shared cost between the buyer and seller: It is also intended to be for the sole advantage of the buyer: The biggest point to remember is that it needs to build credibility and trust in you as the new owner:

Typically, it is printed on practice letterhead, but keep in mind that printing, folding and mailing thousands of letters can be cost and time intensive. In the past; we have done this manually with our own team; our own printers in the office, and have paid the 50-cent stamp rate. In the end, we burned through printer cartridges very fast, broke another printer; and took 3 evenings of work to accomplish. It was a nightmare. What's a better system? We encourage you to draft this letter on practice letterhead, and then hire a mail processor to actually print, fold, and mail this for you: Amazingly enough, it will likely cost about 55 cents per letter; due to bulk-mail savings rates on postage.

# See below for example letters:

Dear Patient;

Thank you for entrusting your dental care to me for more than 30 years. I am writing to tell you that I have decided to retire from my practice. After practicing for many years, I’m ready to step away: It has been a privilege for me to care for you and your families, which for some includes several generations.

It was my top priority to find the right person to take over the practice, and I am excited to say I have found the perfect match in Dr:
---
personality; am sure you will be pleased to have him as your new dentist. He will assume responsibility for the practice on July 1st.

Dr. [Name] was born and raised in CITY, and is a graduate of the University of STATE College of Dentistry. Over the past 5 years, he has performed dental mission work in Jamaica and routinely volunteers at the local homeless shelter clinic. He and his wife are enjoying their first year of marriage and are excited about this opportunity. I feel very confident having Dr. [Name] take over my practice, and am eager for you to meet him at your next dental appointment.

I expect a seamless transition with Dr. [Name]. He has the support of myself and my staff, all of whom are staying with the practice and are looking forward to seeing you and providing you with the level of care you have come to expect from the office. I feel blessed to have had you as my patients and friends. Thank you for your loyalty and support. Although I will miss seeing you, know you are in good hands with Dr. [Name].

Sincerely,
Dr. John Q. Seller; DDS

# To the best patients in the world,

After 4 years of dental school and 33 years of practicing dentistry, I have determined it is now time for the next chapter in my life, retirement. Although there are things I will miss, such as working with great coworkers and the interactions with many delightful patients, I anticipate the joys of more time spent with my wonderful wife, my children, my parents, and now my two grandchildren. I look forward to more time for travel and time at the lake sailing, and the simple joys of gardening, yard work, and cooking.

I feel very fortunate and in fact honored to have so many patients express their trust and confidence in me over the years. I have never taken that responsibility lightly. I realize the magnitude of that trust and faith and understand its significance; I do indeed feel honored. As many of you have seen, there have been changes at the office during the past year. Part of transitioning to retirement is to be sure those patients that have had faith and confidence in me are going to continue to be cared for and treated in a manner that best serves them. I am grateful that Dr. [Name] has joined the practice to fill the void I leave. I believe she has not only the technical dental skills, but equally or perhaps even more importantly the perspective and caring attitude that serving the needs of the patient is paramount, and that it is their best interest that must be served. I have always believed that if you do what is right for the patient in a fair and honest manner, most everything else falls into place. I know that Dr. [Name] feels the same sense of devotion and responsibility, and it is a great comfort to me to know that all my patients have the opportunity to continue with a very competent compassionate dentist whose values are in the right place.
---
Over the years have seen many patients that started with my dad as far back as the sixties when he was on 0 Street: have cared for their dental needs, seen them have children, cared for those children, watched them grow up, have children of their own, and yet again provided care for those children. It has truly been a joy; and feel a closeness loyalty to them and feel very honored to have been allowed that opportunity: Many of you will miss and again appreciate your confidence in me. wish you all the best: forever

Sincerely,
John Q. Seller

While letters to each mailing address should include every household and will hopefully be received by most patients, there will still be patients that; for one reason or another; will not get the letter: Their address could have changed, or they might have just thrown away the letter: Since our goal is to inform every patient before they come in for their next appointment; we need to find a way to inform them:

We suggest that you will want to follow up the letter with an email: The timing of the email is important; because you will want the letter to hit their mailboxes prior to the email: In order to ensure this occurs, it's best to wait 4 to 5 days after sending the letter before sending out any email announcements.

The email announcement should be the exact same letter above, with links to the updated practice website where there might be more pictures and personal information about the new doctor and team:

Hopefully the letter email will catch nearly 100% of all patients, but you will still likely see patients walk in the door and be shocked to learn that their beloved doctor has left! For these scenarios, you and your team will need to be prepared to both address it with a physical letter as well as a well rehearsed narrative.

To be prepared for this, have a stack of letters printed out at the front desk for the first 4-6 months of the transition. The primary goal with a transition script, and printed letters at the front desk; is to build confidence and trust between the new doctor and the patient base. When a senior doctor leaves, the objective is to seamlessly pass on authority and goodwill to the new doctor; so that patients give the new doctor a try before leaving to go to another practice.

Below is a script your team can use as a framework for confirmation calls:

"Hello, this is Susie with Grain Acres Dental just calling to confirm Brian's appointment for 9 am tomorrow for a cleaning: We look forward to seeing you and just wanted to make sure that you received the news about the transition between Dr. Seller and Dr. Buyer: Dr. Seller hand picked Dr. Buyer to take over his practice and as of XXX date, things have been going
---
smoothly: Dr: Buyer is just the nicest person and very similar to Dr: Seller; we know that you will love him: Can't wait to see you tomorrow!

In this message script; you hit the major points:

- Confirmation of the appointment
- Reminder of the transition that they have hopefully already received
- Transfer of Trust between Dr: Seller and Dr: Buyer
- "Assume the YES" that they will stay with the practice and continue care with you

You will likely encounter situations that will dictate modifying this script. These could include transitions that occurred due to doctor sickness or other emergent factors that may change the tone of the narrative. While it doesn't happen often, these situations do occur and team members may need guidance and preparation for these difficult conversations.

Here is a script for a patient who has arrived at the practice in person and is not aware of the transition:

Team: Good morning Brian, we have you here for your 9 am cleaning: Has anything changed with your address or insurance?

Brian: Nope, all the same.

Team: Great; and did you hear the news about the doctor transition?

Brian: No, is Dr: Seller gone?

Team: Oh I'm sorry; we sent out letters and emails last month about the transition. In the past year; Dr: Seller started looking to retire and hand picked Dr: Buyer to take over care of his patients. Dr: Buyer's a very skilled doctor and all of our patients who have met him, love him: Everyone else is still here and you'll get to meet Dr: Buyer in just a few minutes!

# Mitigating Post Transition Patient Attrition

One of the primary benefits of mastering patient communication is to mitigate attrition. Even though it may feel like overkill to send out letters, emails, and scripts for crucial conversations, it is important to control the narrative to as many patients as possible.

At this point, you might be wondering: what is an appropriate turnover rate during a transition? The truth is that each situation is variable and the percentage of patients who leave a practice in the first year can vary significantly amongst transitions. On average throughout all situations, however, the average typically falls between 70%-90% retention of patients throughout the first year.

To achieve the highest percentage possible, it pays to be extremely prepared. This preparation includes but is not limited to: excellent communication, a solid operational plan from you as the owner, and the ability to build trust and rapport quickly. If you can execute on all of these things well, you are likely to experience a smooth and successful transition.

A challenge that we often encounter when a new doctor takes over a practice from a late career dentist is a general trend of underdiagnosed/undiagnosed dentistry. This manifests itself with very low periodontal treatment percentages in the hygiene department (AKA "Bloody Prophies"), multiple "watches" on teeth that have active decay, and teeth that have been patched numerous times needing to be crowned.

There are many factors that lead to this phenomenon including but not limited to: diminished eyesight of a selling doctor, the departing doctor's unwillingness to have difficult conversations with long-time patients, and years or decades of performing clinical dentistry which may have led to apathy and burnout. When this pattern arises, it is important to take the appropriate steps to minimize patient attrition following the transition and provide ethical and acceptable clinical care.

Treatment planning can be especially challenging when a patient base has been subjected to years of underdiagnosing and "supervised neglect." You might feel like every patient has large treatment plans that they are not expecting. Patients might push back against these treatment plans very hard because, "Dr. Seller never told me about these things." This happens in a large majority of transitions, and so it's good to plan on mitigating these interactions.

Effective communication and handling these situations delicately with the utmost professionalism could make the difference between 10% attrition and mass patient exodus following the transition. A great rule to live by throughout your dental career is to never speak negatively about another colleague to a patient. This is especially important when you take over a practice and begin interacting with the existing patient base.

Although there will certainly be times when you disagree with the previous doctor's diagnosis and treatment plans and may even have to deal with subpar clinical outcomes, it is important to keep your comments to patients as positive as possible.
---
Keep in mind that there is a high likelihood that the patient base has genuine trust and affection for the previous doctor and being overly critical could very quickly erode the trust that you are trying to establish.

We recommend a conversation that sounds something like this:

"It looks like Dr. Jones did a great job caring for your smile over the years by patching several of your teeth and keeping them functional. It is really impressive that these fillings have lasted for X years. That really says a lot about Dr. Jones's quality work. As you can see though, (at this point you can show intraoral pictures of the patient's teeth that need treatment), a few of these teeth are finally starting to break down. Another patch would weaken these teeth to the point that they'd likely break soon after. You have some other teeth that will eventually need some attention but here are the two that will need crowns immediately before we end up in a situation when they can no longer be fixed."

"It looks like Dr. Jones and Sarah have done a good job keeping your teeth clean over the years and I see from your records that you have been doing your part by coming in consistently every 6 months for the last 5 years. Great job! After taking your gum measurements today; we saw quite a bit of bleeding and even a little bit of pus coming out of your gum tissues in these areas. (Good time to show intraoral pictures of bleeding and purulence:) These are actually areas where you have an active infection in your gum tissue. New studies have shown that this type of infection can lead to a host of overall health complications and tooth loss. The good news is, we now know that certain procedures that we perform at this office can eliminate this infection and decrease the risk of tooth loss and systemic health issues."

Notice that there is always an effort to compliment the previous doctor and team members for the previous work that they have done, even if it needs to be replaced. It is also important to be careful not to overwhelm the patients with huge treatment plans right from the beginning of your tenure. Nothing causes a patient to leave a practice faster than a $25,000 treatment plan from a new dentist after the previous dentist just gave them a clean bill of dental health just six months earlier.

The other key is using the words, 'What we now know.' This implies that since Dr. Seller has left, something has changed in the way we treat dental disease. It doesn't negatively speak to Dr. Seller's treatment plans, but it says that now there is a new modality for treatment. It also implies the collective 'we', which means 'All of Dentistry.' When using this statement, it carries a lot of proverbial weight, as well as keeping the statements about the previous dentist positive.

In summary, get good at saying, 'What we now know.' It's best to make modest recommendations and start the rebuilding process slowly. Overall, you should definitely let people know about every problem, but at first you might lean towards the.
---
Most conservative treatments if possible. This might be, see a few dark cracks here that will probably need some treatment in the near future, but today only see one that has active decay: The one with active decay will need a crown; however these others can be monitored for a little while if you are ok waiting on treatment for those teeth. If you go into these conversations with the right mindset, tact and professionalism, you'll be able to retain most of the patient base and build a solid foundation of trust that will eventually grow into a wildly successful practice.

Overall the transition process can be both invigorating and exhausting at the same time. Keep in mind that you are trying to establish yourself as a competent, compassionate and acceptable replacement for a doctor that has built trusting relationships for years. This is no small feat and many patients will initially view you with caution and skepticism: You are literally auditioning for a part: Be kind, be patient and be professional, and you will build trust and credibility quickly.

In order to continue to move towards the vision of your ideal practice, we'll now cover some of the next key areas in a smooth transition.

# Chapter - Technology after the Transition

In the weeks and months before a transition, you'll have a chance to thoroughly assess the technology and infrastructure of the practice. Hopefully with a good amount of presale analysis you will get a good handle on the quality of the setup. Through the presale analysis, you'll also be able to identify which items are good for a few more years, versus what might need to be updated immediately: This analysis needs to happen for both hardware and software.

# Where to Start

When you acquire a practice that already has a level of technology integration, the previous owner will most likely have a technology firm or person they are working with that has helped them to implement these systems. In this case, you will want to assess whether they are a good fit with you, and whether you will continue to use them: The questions below will help you analyze whether to continue working with this firm:

# How to Hire or Evaluate a Technology Firm:

# Insider Tips:

- Most tech salesmen have incentives that do not always align with your best interest
- They make more money when you spend more money
- Do not sign up for a high monthly recurring service
- Try to find a service that charges per hour; typically $80-150/hour
- Get recommendations from other dental offices

# Questions to ask the tech service:

- What are your preferred backup methods?
- Methods should include cloud and local hard drives
- Ask for the number of clients they currently service and for referrals from existing clients similar in size to your dental office
- Do you know how to set up an active directory from scratch?
- Do you have a list of clients?
- How do you structure recurring maintenance fees? What do you charge for
---
Do you have warranties on services provided?

What are your holiday/after hours policies?

What is your response/turnaround time on emergencies issues?

How many employees do you have vs how many clients?

What is your familiarity with dental tech?

Is your software/service HIPAA compliant?

If my server went down, how fast could you physically be on site?

After you find a firm that is a good fit for you and at the price point that you can afford, it is now necessary to work together with them on a plan to ensure that all technology is up-to-date or on schedule to be updated.

# Hardware Analysis and Upgrades

# Server

If you are looking for a server; you will have to rely on your technology firm for guidance. These people should know exactly what to look for that appropriately matches your practice situation and plan for growth. If the server is relatively new and still reliable for a few years, you can move on to other items and update this technology at a later date. If the server is older or does not contain some of the backup capabilities needed however; then you might need to replace it immediately.

Here are a few good server options. On the lower-cost end, you could build something similar to this:

|Intel Xeon 8 Core Business-Class Server|$2,865.00|
|---|---|
|Includes the following:|Includes the following:|
|Intel Xeon processor (8M Cache; 3.40 GHz)| |
|16GB RAM| |
|Mirrored (RAID 1) 2TB Enterprise Ultra Fast hard drives| |
|Intel RAID controller| |
|Internal DVDRW| |
|Integrated video| |
|2-port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 card| |
|1GB server network card & 1GB failover network card| |

If you're looking to build a larger practice or possibly run multiple locations off of one server; however; you'll need to go with more capacity. In those cases, here's an option from another manufacturer:

|HP Proliant ML350 Gen 10 Brand Server| |
|---|---|
|Single Xeon Server Motherboard| |
|Tower Server Case| |
|Antel Xeon Processor| |
|32 GB RAM| |
|Dual Power Supply| |
|Raid Controller| |
|960 GB SSD Hard Drives| |
|Raid Operating System| |
|Windows Server 2019| |
|3 Year Warranty| |
|Total System Price|$54,700.00|
---
The entire server: If one were to break down, the server can still run on the other power supply, and a service technician could actually replace the second power supply at the appropriate time. The other option is the RAID controller and hard drives. A RAID setup is basically a constant backup between two hard drives, so that no matter what happens, your data is secure and lives on one or both of the hard drives. If a hard drive breaks and you need to replace it, you could actually pull the hard drive out while the server is still active and powered. Replacing a broken hard drive while the server is still on, the new hard drive will program and be able to upload all of the data from the functioning hard drive. Of course, this does not mean that you should eliminate either local backups or cloud-based backups, but this is a great way to ensure that your server will be up and running for each day you need it to.

# Workstations

In many acquisitions, the workstations are not ideal for the way the new doctor will be working. When this occurs, the new doctor may need to purchase all new workstations. Although this can be costly, it is worth it to ensure that the practice runs smoothly and that the technology aids rather than hinders the practice's process. If you have to purchase new equipment, you will need to select the appropriate workstation computers for each operatory and desk in the office. While these can get quite expensive, we have found it is possible to control costs if you have the right practice management software. If you use OpenDental, for instance, you will find that you do not need a fancy PC to run the software.

|OptiPlex 3080 Micro|S639.00|81098-57|
|---|---|---|
|You Save|S459.57 (42%)|Free Shipping|

Even most imaging software can run using most workstations. The computer shown to the left is the ideal practice computer for 90% of all uses (We will discuss CBCT uses below). You should ideally have an i5 Intel Processor, 8 GB of Memory, and at least 256 GB hard drive. You could even go with a 500 GB hard drive, but that is not always needed. In general, S600-S850 per computer is sufficient. Also, remember that this does not include screens, mouse, keyboard, or any other accessories. Those will all be an additional expense and will need to be added to the budget:

If you plan to be doing a lot of CBCT and 3-D planning, you'll want to supercharge the workstations that you'll be using for those needs. In these instances, you will not want a 'small form factor' computer because you may need to add a graphics card into the workstation in order to process the CBCT images. In general, you might need to spend about $2,000 per computer that can manage all of those computing needs.
---
# Cone Beam CT Machine or Pano

Many selling doctors these days have not yet invested in a CBCT; due to the fact that this type of large investment late in a career usually yields a poor return-on-investment. If this is the case for the practice that you are purchasing; you might be considering a CBCT purchase to add to the office's technological offerings to enhance diagnosis and advanced clinical procedures.

One of the most economical ways to go about buying a CBCT for a new practice is to go with the company called Renew Digital. They are a national company that sells new and lightly used Panos and CBCT machines. They are extremely economical and they even send the computer and a technician to come install the equipment for you. In our experience, their customer service is excellent and the quality of their equipment is good.

Another option to consider is buying through group deals, like the ones we offer inside of the Dental Success Network. Our network has negotiated deals that are not published to the general public due to confidentiality agreements. You can also find new units with perks and warranties for the same price you will pay for a used unit with a few options that may include a CBCT, computer, delivery and warranty for under $47,000. Check out the Dental Success Network Vendor Page for more details on these deals.

# Practice Management Software

Once you start evaluating a few potential acquisitions, you are likely to come across the names of softwares that you may have never heard of before. This can raise the question of whether this is legitimate software or who the selling doctor purchased it from. Unfortunately, this is not an uncommon occurrence. We've even come across a selling doctor who created his own software that ran on a mid 90's PC with a 3.5" hard-disk.

Early on in your ownership journey, we encourage you to switch to a software that is well-known and respected in the industry and that you are comfortable and familiar with. While we know there is a lot of stress at the beginning of a transition, this is crucial for a few reasons. The main reason is that it will make your life easier and will allow you to practice with speed and efficiency. Switching can also mitigate the risk of embezzlement. According to some statistics, over 70% of dentists will be embezzled from at some point in their career. If you take over a practice and do not have a clue of how to navigate the software, your risk of embezzlement goes up astronomically.

While there are seemingly endless solutions for dental software, there are a few key players that have risen to the top of the market when you're looking for the main practice management platform: Eaglesoft, Dentrix, and OpenDental are all the main names in software, but one stands out for a few reasons.

We encourage, and are very open about our favorite practice management software, OpenDental: The primary reason is that it is the only software that is truly 'open'.
---
free it is very reasonably priced, bordering on absurdly cheap. The customer basically only pays for ongoing support fees. As of this writing, the support fees are around $180/month for the first 6 months, and drop lower after that: The company encourages you to vote on new features and updates the software often to fix bugs and add improvements. This crowd-sourced approach to development has made them a fan favorite for more than a decade. Here's something Dr: Addison has written about them and why they are steadily growing in market share:

# We are at a tipping point:

In the next few years, Open Dental is going to be the most widely used software in dental- and every other platform will be a minor player. Place your bets now: Why should we be so confident about this:

Nathan Sparks, the CEO of Open Dental (OD), knows that OD was a startup software created by a user who just wanted it to work for what they needed- particularly for his brother; and getting better reports. So why is this startup going to rule the marketplace? Here's my bet- Disruptive Innovation.

For those who haven't heard of the term; suggest you Google it and watch Clayton Christensen- a Harvard Business professor and author of the book 'The Innovators Dilemma'. In the book; he explains how late entrants join a market and may offer a seemingly less quality product: They are often short on cash, resources, and potentially short on technology (Think Apple 1985). There are established players in the industry; that should be able to evolve, and have all the cash and resources in the world (Think Microsoft).

The smaller players are able to maneuver the marketplace and technological curve much faster; and develop technology that tackles the needs of the customer more closely than large corporations- where the timeline for development may take many years:

# From Dr. Christensen:

Characteristics of disruptive businesses, at least in their initial stages, can include: lower gross margins, smaller target markets, and simpler products and services that may not appear as attractive as existing solutions when compared against traditional performance metrics. Because these lower tiers of the market offer lower gross margins, they are unattractive to other firms moving upward in the market; creating space at the bottom of the market for new disruptive competitors to emerge.

In the case of OD they started small- solving the problems of just Dr. Jordan Sparks' office. As a dentist; he knew what the dental industry actually needed. Rather than being driven by a large player like Henry Schein, Dr: Sparks could actually design software that solved the solutions on the ground level for all in the dental field. Oddly enough, he built it on a platform- SQL Server- that is easily attainable, and open-source. OD was also cheaper than all other options- both to start and
---
monthly costs. It started as a no-frills product, attacking the bottom of the market: This would make it seem like a low-quality product. That couldn't be further from the truth. That's where Disruptive Innovation happens - at the 'seemingly' bottom of the market: For years, OD has functioned as a product that has no marketing team, and where users vote on the next feature to be added by the development team:

At first; Henry Schein and others didn't even pay attention to the fly on the wall. OD was just an upstart like all the rest: HS had the money; and they were building products like Dentrix Ascend: Dentrix Ascend was meant to be the next 'Sustaining Innovation' where all the data could be in the cloud. This has turned into colossal failure, and they are seeing users flee as fast as they can 're-brand' and re-unveil the software.

OD has now morphed into a major strong dental platform. Used by corporate groups that have over 120 offices, down to the boutique dental office on the street corner: The different services that can sync into the software make it usable by many varieties of users: The reporting features make it very clear; and you can easily add more 3rd party reporting software to get higher level reports: Since 'Disruptive Innovation' is a theory only coined in the last 20 years, it's entertaining to see it happening in the dental field. One of the most special things - and why this theory applies accurately is that OD asks its users every day to Vote on features they want: They are crowd-sourcing the next developments that users want to see. Even the CEO is on a Facebook group asking and responding to the day-to-day issues that come up.

It is because of Disruptive Innovation that Open Dental is going to be the biggest dental software in the next few years:

Dr. Addison Killeen, Posted on Dental Success Network

The above information points to a bit of the advantages of OpenDental over its competitors. But if we were to actually list it out, here are the big advantages, in order of priority:

1. You own your entire database and all the data within it, 100% control
2. Customization of the software to meet your needs
3. Modularity - meaning you have the ability to utilize many 3rd party softwares that work well with OpenDental's platform
4. The ability to use from the cloud if that is your preference
5. The ability to use many different imaging softwares
6. Lowest price

Remember to check out the end of the book to see the OpenDental Startup Guide Manual and links to videos on Dental Success Network:

# Imaging

Occasionally; the practice already has an imaging software that works well with the sensors that they use. In these cases, we usually recommend that you keep this software and use those sensors as long as they deliver a high quality image. If they are not up to your standards, you...
---
may need to consider purchasing new sensors, or buying new sensors and software.

If you are looking for new imaging software, we encourage you to try out Apteryx XRayVision and XDR. We endorse these two softwares because they also work with many different brands of sensors. It cannot be stated enough, we will only recommend softwares that will work with many different types of hardware. Any software that locks you into one specific type of sensor is most likely a bad idea.

# Insurance Verification

With the amount of activity that occurs at the typical dental office front desk, most team members report varying levels of stress on any given day. This feeling is heightened significantly during a transition. In order to lessen this stress, you may want to consider outsourcing certain administrative tasks like insurance verification. Two companies that we've found useful for insurance verification are Verrific and Verifixed. Verrific integrates well with OpenDental. To get an insurance breakdown on a patient; the staff member presses a button, sends it out, and within a day or two the information comes back in a fully uploadable file containing patient eligibility and insurance benefits.

# Phones

If you are considering upgrading your phones we've had good luck with Mango Voice. Mango Voice is the overwhelming favorite with the members of the Dental Success Network. You can switch over your old phone number; including phone hardware, for an all inclusive price of $25/phone/month. Usually when you pay for a full year upfront; you will get the phones for free. The system also allows for a digital fax line. Mango also has a few features that work well with all the other softwares. The system integrates an app with your personal cell phone that allows you to call or receive calls from your office as if you were physically there. They also record all calls for quality assurance purposes.

# Analytics

Analytics platforms can take pertinent data from the practice's management software and display it in a convenient user friendly interface. The largest in the industry is Dental Intelligence. This platform, usually called by their shortened name of Dental Intel, has an active web-based dashboard. The cost for Dental Intel is usually much higher; and we are not usually fans of expensive options. Divergent Dental differs in that it does not have a web platform. This company sends out executive-style reports each morning, night, week-end and month-end. These reports can be emailed to anyone on the team, and are a succinct way to look at the practice from an analytical perspective. For less than $200 a month, this software is a DSN favorite.
---
# HR and Payroll

Another software that is quite popular by the DSN members is Gusto for payroll and HR needs. They are an extremely simple platform that can help you manage payroll, onboarding, and the HR needs of the typical small business. They continually add functions and services on an almost monthly basis, including QSEHRA monthly healthcare stipends and 401(k) offerings.

For other Human Resources needs bordering on legal help, we also can recommend CEDR. Paul Edwards, the CEO of CEDR, has been helping dentists for many years, and we can personally attest to the success with their help navigating difficult employee situations. Dealing with the specific HR laws of your state may be a nightmare; but their team of attorneys that specialize in the dental field can help you as you deal with problems that arise.

# Summary of all Softwares

In all, this 'stack' of softwares have become member favorites amongst DSN members for their cost, customer service and quality:

- OpenDental
- Apteryx or XDR
- Mango Phones
- Divergent Dental Analytics
- Gusto
- CEDR

As a new business owner you have the opportunity to choose the software that will enhance your practice management experience. Remember that in order to be successful in this transition, you do not have to reinvent the wheel. Following what many other experts have done and utilizing tools that they implement is going to be the fastest route to realizing your ideal practice. We hope that the notes in this chapter have helped introduce you to some efficiencies that will help you save time and money moving forward.

# Chapter 8

# Cash Flow and Insurances

In comparison to a Startup, the financials of an Acquisition are favorable in the beginning because you have purchased an existing business that has a history and cash flow to sustain you. Regardless of this benefit; there is still stress during the transition. Credentialing with insurance companies, dealing with patients who are not trained to pay on the day-of-service, team and HR challenges, and countless other factors - all lead to a delayed cash flow in the beginning compared to what you can expect at the 3-6 month mark:

# Reading Financial Reports

Your accountant will likely give you three reports each month. The first is called the Balance Sheet. Like its name implies, it balances debt and assets. Here are some notes on the balance sheet for simple reference:

Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)Point in time "snapshot" of financialsShows-What you own (Including Bank account balances)What you owe (Loans and such)Balance or financial positionYou can have a negative 'Net Worth'Should grow (positive) over timeSuccessive statements identify trends

A sample balance sheet is displayed on the following page. In this example, all of the assets are listed at the top. In an acquisition, there will be a few key items including the assets that you purchased from the seller; as well as the 'goodwill' of the seller. Underneath that is the liabilities that you have with any bank: All loans are included in this second portion.

The final number is your net worth: This is the 'intangible' value of the practice at any point.
---
This is purely a financial metric, and should really not be used for anything more than purely internal documents. This is not the 'value' of the practice in reality- which would be calculated by a totally different method.

Thenext two statements are very similar: One is the Profit and Loss statement (income Statement or "P&L"), and the other is the cash flow statement: Here is a quick run-down on P&L:

# Income Statement (Profit and Loss Statement)

Shows money flow over time
---
# Month, quarter; year or other

Indicates taxable income and expense items

Indicates a profit or loss

# Two types-

- Cash- what goes in versus what comes out
- Accrual- what goes in versus expenses that come out later (ex: lab fee)

We think this is a more accurate method for managerial purposes

# Real world

Shows what 'profit' was made, before the next three items:

- Does not show actual cash in hand
- This is on the balance sheet
- Does not show debt payments
- Remember that debt payments do not impact taxable profits

The income statement is the most useful statement that you will want to look at after the end of each month: Typically your accountant or bookkeeper will take about 10-12 days to go through all income and expenses to clean everything up. They should then send you a preliminary statement that you can review: In this process, you will want to double check all expenses to make sure that they are categorized correctly: Incorrect categorization of expenses will make your reports inaccurate and unhelpful:

The most detailed statement, which looks very similar to the Income statement, is the Cash Flow statement. Here are the quick notes on this type of document:

- Cash receipts and disbursements over a time
- Similar to Income Statement and P&L
- All inflows equal all outflows

|Cash Inflows|Cash Outflows|
|---|---|
|Patient Payments|Pay bills|

Overall; having a good grasp on the financials of the practice from the beginning will be key to long-term success. Even if the numbers do not interest you; there is a huge value to being familiar with how money flows through the practice in order to be able to make managerial decisions as you grow.

# Cash Flow in an Acquisition

As you transition the practice, collections may turn out to be lower than you expect during the first few months, and costs might be much higher than normal: This often occurs because of the need to purchase equipment and supplies. For this reason, plan for collections to be slightly lower and be prepared to use a bank line of credit or working capital loan to float your expenses if necessary. Collections will lag mainly due to insurance payments, credit card payments, and possibly slower patient payments. Any sort of payment plan may add to this trend.

If you have purchased the accounts receivable, you will have the benefit of immediate cash flow coming in from the collections of the selling doctor. This cash comes in handy when paying for supplies, payroll, and miscellaneous costs during the first few months of business ownership. If you do not purchase the accounts receivable, you will most likely need to have that line of credit ready to use for a month or two until your collections catch up. To plan out potential costs during this time, you will need to forecast enough cash to cover for payrolls, rent, supplies, etc. for those first two months.

Oftentimes, the selling doctor may have a drop in production and collections during the last few months of ownership. There are many potential reasons for this occurrence: the doctor may not want to start cases he or she cannot finish or may just want to coast to the finish line. Regardless of the reason for the dip, it will most definitely affect cash flow in the first few months for the new owner. Whether this common scenario will play out will not typically be discovered until the transition is complete, as the seller is not always obligated to share financials with the buyer after an accepted offer has been made.

Always try to remember to anticipate the worst case scenario and be prepared for as many potential cash flow challenges as possible.

# Upgrading the Practice

In most practice acquisitions, the buyer will need to make some degree of upgrades to the practice. This may include cosmetic upgrades or technical upgrades such as computers, servers, equipment, digital sensors, or a CBCT. These large expenses should have been planned already; and your bank should help finance these expenses from the beginning. The goal should be to finance as many upgrades over a few years to protect the cash flow in the first few months. If you are clear and organized about what capital is needed, most banks will be open to financing these improvements.

# Overhead

Much like cash flow, overhead will almost always be elevated during the first few months following transition. In most cases this occurs because you will likely have a legacy staff cost and other costs that were held over from the selling dentist. But, as you start to get a handle on all of the vendors and costs within the practice, you will begin to pick and choose your...
---
# Accounting/Bookkeeping Principles

During this transition, you may choose to start a new relationship with an accountant or bookkeeper to be an extension of your team: Here are a few things to consider during the selection process.

The first consideration is accrual versus cash accounting basis. We recommend the accrual method because it takes into account when the expense was incurred, not necessarily when it was paid. Sometimes bills are incurred on a credit card in January; but will not be paid until February or March. For reporting and management purposes, we find it useful to utilize accrual accounting to make accurate financial decisions regarding expense allocation throughout a particular month.

Another scenario that we often see with many accountants is delayed reporting: It is not unreasonable to expect your income statements or P&L reports by the 12th of the month. Some accountants will even try to convince you to accept quarterly statements, and this is even worse. We firmly believe it is virtually impossible to manage a practice effectively unless reports are provided monthly in a timely manner.

# Monthly Break Even (MBE)

One of the first things that you will want to calculate as expenses start to stabilize at month 2 or 3 is the monthly break even point. This is the addition of all of the fixed and average variable expenses, plus any debt service. Debt service would include interest and principal payments made on practice notes, equipment loans, lines of credit.

# Ideal Numbers

As your revenues and expenses start to level out, you can start to gamify the numbers: We use the term gamify because getting more profitable can be viewed as a game, similar to golf, where we are challenged to improve over time and try to get better. Just like golf, there is a 'par' or break even score. The goal is to spend equal to or less than the target score per category.

These are the average numbers per category that we have seen across the industry for high-performing practices. Here's a list of some of the major areas and targeted overhead numbers:

|Variable (low hanging fruit)|Target|Ideal|
|---|---|---|
|Supplies|5%|4.5% or lower|
|Lab|g%|7% or lower|
|Combined Supplies/Lab|14%|11.5% or lower|
|Marketing|4.5%|(depending on the situation)|
|Offices expenses|1.2%| |
|Other expenses|5.5%|4.5%|

# Merchant fees

# Patient refunds

# Fixed

# Continuing education

|Payroll|30%|Ideal 25% or lower|
|---|---|---|
|Front/Back office|16%|Ideal 13% or lower|
|Hygiene|9%|Ideal 8% or lower|
|Fringe benefits|2.5%|Ideal 2% or lower|
|Facility/Equipment|9%|Ideal 7% or lower|
|Rents| | |
|Utilities| | |
|Equipment repair| | |

Knowing and correcting your variable costs will lower your overhead

Increasing collection and lowering fixed costs leads to lowering your overhead

Above is the example scorecard by Custom Practice Analytics that we use inside of the Dental Success Institute to track our members' financial progress. As you can see, this shows the target range expenses for a practice that is trying to get to 60% overhead. Remember what Karl Pearson, the father of statistics once said, "That which is measured, improves. That which is measured and reported, improves exponentially." This is commonly noted as Pearson's Law: To achieve success in your business, you will want to be fanatical about measuring and improving.

Scorecards like this, paired with a monthly cadence of analytics, will lead to exponential growth and profitability for you, the business owner.

# When to Grow

As you start to get a handle on your new acquisition, you will likely have questions about when to add more hygiene hours, when to add another assistant; or open up another operatory.
---
are some of the most common symptoms we see that indicate it may be time to expand.

# When to add more Hygiene Hours

- Hygiene booked out (85%+) for 3+ weeks
- Booking out new patients more than 14 days
- New patient flow is maintaining/increasing
- Recall/Reactivation is happening and having to book out far into the future

# When to add another dental assistant (If the practice can handle it)

- Patient volume in general is increasing
- No overflow time
- Same day treatment trending down
- New patient flow is throttled

# When to look at adding an associate doctor

- Periodic plus new patient exams exceed 125-130+ per doctor on a consistent basis
- Doctor booking out operative more than 4 weeks

Trying to discuss the entire overhead and financial process for a practice could alone fill a 300+ page book; but we hope that some of the basics covered in this chapter have been a helpful resource. Remember that in order to be a sophisticated business owner; you will need to have a deep understanding of financial reports. We also find it useful to gamify those reports and to constantly work towards improving the profitability of the practice. While the numbers at the beginning will not look good, using the documents and resources in this book will make sure you are prepared for the first few months when you actually do not make any profit. Finally; remember as you grow and the profitability increases there will be certain benchmarks that let you know when it is time to grow and expand to further utilize the resources of the practice that you have built:

# How to Manage Insurances

One of the most misunderstood, and likely ignored, topics during an acquisition is fee negotiations and credentialing: However; this decision makes a monumental difference in the financial success, and stressors, of a practice once the buyer takes over: One of the best outcomes is when the buyer can achieve a significantly higher fee schedule than the selling doctor; but this is not always easy or advised: The major determining factor in this decision is cash flow: When it comes to credentialing; the buyer is faced with a bit of a 'rock and hard place' dilemma of two tough choices. The choice centers around whether to negotiate first on a new tax ID and then credential, or go through the path of quickest credentialing by inheriting the seller's contracts. We have done both, and there are advantages to each strategy:

# New Tax ID and Credentialing from Scratch

A new tax ID is one of the best weapons a dentist has that; if used right; can provide one of the highest fee schedules in the area. A new tax ID often gets the highest reimbursements because of the flexibility it provides the dental office. While this is extremely counterintuitive, the field of fee negotiations and credentialing is far more convoluted than what most people believe due to a lot of 'shared networks' and 'umbrella networks'. A skilled negotiating and credentialing company can utilize the new tax ID in the most optimized way to get the best possible insurance reimbursements. We do not suggest negotiating on your own:

We discussed this with Vivek Kinra of PPO Profits. PPO Profits has done work on hundreds of acquisitions, the fee differences between what the seller had and what the buyer got on a new tax ID is often very significant: Very often we see that sellers have not increased fees in many years, they have very low fees negotiated, and a very convoluted poor credentialing structure. In cases such as these, Mr. Kinra saw that proper negotiations and credentialing led to a 60-80% improvement on negotiated 'in-network' fees.

One downside is that negotiating and credentialing on a new tax ID greatly increases the timeline before the buyer becomes fully credentialed and contracted with the insurance companies: This absolutely slows cash flow; so be aware of that downside. The timeline varies between insurances, but in the best case, it's often 4 months but some insurances like Aetna and Metlife can take a year depending on some other circumstances.

Beware, this option almost always creates some friction between the new doctor (who wants the highest fees) and the front office team (who wants simplicity). No matter what anyone does, choosing this option should be done with a clear understanding that the first year for the dentist, patients, and front office team will be very frustrating: However; the key here is to understand and manage the frustrations, and embrace the reality that this option will be very rocky: This is the option for doctors who are willing to go through a year of administrative pain to get the best possible fees from there on out.

Mr. Kinra also gave some interesting perceptions on dentists who went through with the new tax ID and negotiation process. He said that 100% of dentists who go through renegotiation somewhat regret it while undergoing the process, and at the same time 100% of dentists polled say they are glad they went through option two and would do it again: When choosing a firm to help you navigate these tricky waters, we would expect that a good negotiating/credentialing firm would be super clear with the expectations and super tight with communication with the office. Additionally; it is imperative that the entire front office team is part of the process from the get-go and are empowered to be able to get through the impending challenges that await them for the first year.

The largest downside to negotiating a new fee schedule with a new Tax ID is that cash flow is slow: If you can manage it, then we do suggest trying this option: However; if cash flow is a concern, then it may be better to consider other options.
---
concern and you do not have a large line of credit with the bank; then we do not suggest trying this option, even though it is desirable.

# Inherit the Fee Schedules from the Seller

This option leads to the fastest credentialing and contracting (note credentialing and contracting are two different terms), but you have now just inherited fees from the seller and you will begin building claim data that insurance companies can access. This option is good for the short term for buyers as the patients may see very little (if any) difference as they see the new doctor; however, it is less desirable for the long term because the web of poor credentialing often becomes so entangled that most offices deal with this problem by simply not exiting these poor plans. Depending on the seller's contracts, the buyer may have also inadvertently inherited a credentialing spider web that most offices never bother untangling. Additionally, if you now decide to engage an outside negotiating company, it becomes far more challenging to get the same top fees and structure the credentialing properly.

We suspect that most often prospective buyers have no idea about the two options and the benefits of each. Ideally, any buyer should be totally aware of the options, and make a focused decision on how they want to credential. We think that accepting the fee schedules of the seller is what most dentists go through because the office manager or the insurance coordinator of the seller simply takes over the credentialing process. They can simply call the insurance companies and complete the 'port of authority' or 'change of ownership' form to transfer the contracts to the new buyer.

While both options are less than ideal, the buying doctor should carefully evaluate the business conditions and cash flow of the office to make the decision. If he/she selects a new tax ID and negotiations, and would like to use a credentialing company, then it is ideal to get the front office team's buy-in and getting them involved as early as possible including while interviewing credential firms.

In summary, you can go with a quick option which preserves cash flow where the buyer takes over the seller's contracts and networks. This provides a quick and easy option, but stunts the ability to renegotiate later. The more difficult short term option is to negotiate a new tax ID, and while this creates more headaches in the short term, it can provide for much higher reimbursements in the future.

# Difficulties in Change

No matter which option you choose, there will be a certain amount of time that you are considered 'out of network'. During this time, make sure to ask each insurance company for their particular rules. Some of them will want you to hold claims for a few weeks until you are in-network, while some will not back-date any claims in which case you will need to submit claims out of network. For these claims, you will need to make a decision as to whether you will charge for their out-of-network fees, or give some sort of a discount.

215
---
Another challenge that may occur in these scenarios is that the payment often gets sent to the patient.

# Here are some ways these situations can be handled:

- Require that the patient pay up front for their entire bill and let them know that their insurance company will send them a check (not encouraged unless selling doctor did this previously).
- Wait until insurance pays and then bill the patient (more palatable option).
- Wait until insurance pays, and have patient bring in a check to you (endorse the check to your practice on the back), make write-offs for any amount over what insurance pays (possible best option).

In any of the options above, your solution might change if the charges are for preventative services versus restorative. With restorative, we will often require the patient to make their co-pay on the day of service, and allow any other balances to wait until the insurance has come back:

The most important measure here is that the practice needs to be flexible. Remember that in an acquisition there is a lot of uncertainty with patients and you must do everything you can to build trust as quickly as possible.

In case you go with option one and do it in house, use the sample spreadsheet to the right - the Insurance Verification Checklist. Download from the link to the right:

|Insurance Company|Terminated|Received all paperwork|Confirmation they have submitted to Company|In-Network|Contact Name and Information|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Actna| | | | | |Most recent mailed paperwork|
|Ameritas| | | | | | |
|Assurant| | | | | | |

|United Concordia|8| | | | | |

Here is a resource to help you to manage the different timelines for each insurance network or umbrella network: Make sure that either you, or a very detail-oriented front desk employee, is doing all of the paperwork and completing this process for you:

# Taxes in Your Transition

# The Purchase Process

As your first year of practice ownership comes to a close, you must begin to think about taxes. If any profit was generated, you may be looking at having to write a check to the IRS. The good news is you will have the depreciation from the purchased assets to deduct against the taxes owed for the year:

In this scenario, look to the IRS Form 8594 discussed in Chapter 4 to see exactly how much depreciation you will be able to take in the first year. Most of the time it is the entire amount listed on that form.

# Optimization

A smart business owner will try to take legal advantage of anything they can to ensure that they pay the least amount in taxes, while investing any available capital into the business. Most accountants will be able to help with many of these strategies but it is very important to find an accountant who has a sound knowledge of the dental industry in order to help in all facets of the business and tax planning. Here are a few of the items to review with your tax professional:

- Vehicle allowance: Your business can legally pay for a portion of your vehicle for business purposes. Discuss with your accountant the best way to pay for a portion of the vehicle through the company or for any deductible automobile expenses.
- Meals and Entertainment: There are legal ways to deduct meals and entertainment if the expenses were business related. Discuss the specifics with your tax professional.
- Cell Phone and Internet: In this day and age, having a cell phone is a necessity for a business owner. We are on call for our patients much of the time. It is acceptable to run cell phone expenses through the practice. If we have a 'Home Office' it is also legal to pay for a portion of our home internet; to work on payroll, accounting, statistics, and completing patients' charts at night.
- Home Office: Most business owners use their home as a 'home office' for varying periods of time. For periods of 10-12 hours per week, the IRS will allow the expense of an office at your residence. One way to calculate this deduction is to add up all the square feet of the home office, and research a market rate per sq. ft. per year in your area. The other method is called the 'Safe Harbor'. The IRS has defined a normalized method to rent your residence, and this is $5 for up to 300 sq. ft. of your home. The total in this scenario is $1,500 rent payment to yourself each year for rent.
- Renting Your Home: It is legal for you to rent your own house for work-related events for up to 14 days per year at a normal market rate. In order to do this, ask for 3 competing...
---
bids from local establishments on a room rental. When you have collected competing bids, shoot for times of the year that may be at the higher end of the spectrum: Be sure to check with your CPA before counting this as a business expense, as it is becoming increasingly scrutinized.

Travel: Many times there are CE courses offered in distant and exotic locations. These trips can be written off if they are considered "ordinary and necessary" to run your dental business. If you choose to take your spouse, their flight may not be a necessary business expense, but the hotel room for you is surely ordinary and necessary.

Other business expenses: Remember that any item or asset that is used for business can legally be purchased by the business.

In general, taxes are a part of life. You have to pay them, and you will most likely pay quite a substantial amount. The key to being successful is using the tax code to your advantage and to pay the correct amount; not overpay. This is why it is incredibly important to shop around for advisors and an accountant who can help you to legally minimize your tax liabilities.

# Marketing and Rebranding

On rare occasions practice acquisition will come with a great brand, long history, and good reputation in town. In these cases, it often means that there is strong new patient flow, solid production, and no need to change much in order to gain traction in the community: If you have found a practice like this, consider yourself extremely fortunate. Typically these practices are few and far between. If you buy a practice like this, then you might only need to maintain or improve your marketing; without the need to completely rebrand.

More often, practices come with virtually no brand awareness, or even an undesirable brand. These cases warrant the need for a complete rebranding of the office more centered around you and the services that you offer:

We often see a practice that has named the office after themselves, and with virtually no brand: They are often called, John Seller D.D.S., P.C. with no icon, no color palette, and no brand: While this was very standard about 25 years ago, it is a recipe for disaster in today's connected world.

Remember that Dental Success Network has a 4 Hour Marketing Course taught by Dr. Addison Killeen and DSN Faculty Member Ryan Gross, the CEO of myCMOshare. This course is a good synopsis of all the marketing techniques and expands on a lot of the information found in this chapter:

From the time you begin considering acquiring an office, you will want to be thinking about how to handle the brand and marketing after the transition. But before we dig too deep into any of the strategies, let's identify the difference between 'brand' and 'marketing'.

219

# Difference between Brand and Marketing

While many people think that marketing is all about 'advertising', it actually is not. Examples of advertising include buying ad space in different mediums like radio, billboards, mailers and physical space you have, to your communication methods with your patients.

While this is part of the overall plan, it is not all-encompassing: Marketing includes all of your activities from your advertising; to your patient experience, all the way through your patient follow-up.

All of your marketing activities however; are based around your brand. Creating a brand is often well executed by corporate dentistry and they often spend large amounts of money to develop and push it out to the masses. They often spend hundreds of millions of dollars across the industry on web-advertising, Nascar sponsorships, and TV ads in order to become recognizable to their target audience. Recently, we were even talking to an entrepreneur who sold his business for $1.2 Billion about 6 years ago to IBM: He shared that during his merger and acquisition, they actually assessed that his brand added another $100 Million to the purchase price! Quite simply; brand matters. It matters to big corporations, and it matters in our communities as we do our best to position our practices as the best option for new and existing patients.

# ReBrand

Your new brand is something that will be with you for a long time, so as you start to make decisions on names and branding; it is important to consider the entire package. Assess whether the previous brand is something you want to model or sharply diverge from: On some occasions it is possible to incorporate the previous name and logo into your new brand: In these cases, you will want to get some help on how to create the new brand in a way that incorporates colors, themes, or references back to the old brand.

If you choose to go with an entirely new brand, you will have much more freedom: If you elect to start with a clean slate, reflect on what makes you different from all other offices in town. If you need more clarity in this area, go back to the first chapter on Vision. You will want to market an experience, so keep that in mind as you develop your brand. No matter what the previous practice looked like, you can decide from this day forward what your practice will be and how it will be unique.

How do you want your patients to feel when they walk in the office? Creating your desired experience includes the logo colors that you select all the way through the colors you paint the walls. Be deliberate to make sure your practice interior matches the brand and experience you're going to be putting out into the world. As you start to create this, you'll constantly be asking yourself, 'What is my story?'

# Changing a Name

We have both gone through multiple practice name changes and we admit that the process can be challenging: The most difficult part is finding a unique name that encompasses the style of dentistry you practice, the city you are in; and the level of quality that you want to convey.
---
difficult balancel In many cases, we started by flipping through a phone book and searching for words, neighborhoods, and geographies that matched the feeling we were trying to capture. Once you get a list going, ask any trusted advisors around you for their thoughts.

# Here are some parameters to keep in mind when renaming and rebranding a practice:

# Easy to say

Needs to be something short; simple, and have good positive vibes. Your staff will be saying it a lot, find something catchy:

# Easy to spell

Something that has a "tch" in it, or a "ae" or "ou". probably not good. Those can often be difficult to spell, which can impact branding: You want your name to be more similar to a name brand drug like Lipitor, less like something hard to spell like 'Atorvastatin'.

# Good connotations

You want your name to elicit positive emotions. Think of locations that are nice, gentle, airy, beautiful. they have prefixes like 'beau' or endings like "lux". Beau means beauty, lux means luxurious. Having a slight change in the letters, but still sounding or looking like the word of origin will have a greater chance of having a positive effect on the brain.

Positive sounding words to copy parts of: absolutely: accepted. acclaimed. accomplish. accomplishment: beaming: beautiful. believe. beneficial. bliss. calm: celebrated. certain. champ. champion. dazzling: delight. delightful. distinguished. earnest. easy: ecstatic. effective. fabulous. fair: familiar: famous. generous. genius. genuine. giving. handsome. happy: harmonious. Healing:

Think of two nonsense words: Mar OrZeg: Which is positive, which is more negative. You likely picked Mar as the positive word. Why? Your brain may have connected the letter Z in Zeg which is more commonly associated with movie/TV villains and the word Mar is similar to 'mer' which is Latin for sea, which could be seen as calming:

# Somehow connected to your area, mission, or specialty

Pick something like a tree, a river; something that connects with your base. If you're in the mountains, perhaps a name that connects with that: If you're in the plains a name like 'Prairie Skies' is a starting point:

# Decent Web address URL

Even if your selected practice name isn't available in the simple NAME.COM format, you can still select something similar that's easy to remember: Research the availability of MYNAME:com or include the location NAMECITYCOM. Disney has many URLs that use 'MY' as the prefix.

# Iconography that can make it work

The last step after you have selected a name is to create iconography- or the little logo image. Go to Logocontest.com to pay $200 down, you'll get dozens of ideas for a logo. You can then select a winner; who then gets the $200. From there, you can work directly with that designer to improve and finalize the logo.
---
These websites are also great for brainstorming and generating ideas. You can then use a different designer for the final icon/logo.

Searching for available existing Trademarks and Website URLs is a first step before settling on a name and design: In many cases, the name or URL you want may already be taken. While this can be discouraging to have to keep researching new names, remember that there may be other combinations that may make your website URL more memorable. This could include using the word 'my' in front of the name, or even going with a .co or '.net' domain name extension.

If the corporation name and your brand name are the same, it lessens any confusion, but they do not necessarily have to be the same. In our examples, we used 'Grain Acres Dental LLC' as the entity; but the practice name does not have to be 'Grain Acres Dental'. It could be called something like 'Smile Dental', and then when deposits are put into the bank all checks are endorsed with a stamp that says 'Grain Acres Dental LLC dba Smile Dental'. The "dba" stands for "doing business as" and allows you to have a different LLC or PC name than your marketing or branding name.

# Logo Icon Design

A brand is much more than a logo, but the logo is where it all starts and can make a huge difference in the ease of spreading the message. As you design your logo, consider how it will appear in different settings:

- Billboard appearance
- Printing appearance (shirts) - keep it simple
- Stitching appearance on shirts
- Embroidery can be difficult if logo is too complicated

Make sure the colors you pick match the feel/brand. Choose clean colors with no gradient. Pick a logo that is easily definable. Draw familiarity from local landmarks.

Be sure to lean on expert help throughout the process. In the past, we have used 99designs or logocontest.com to help us generate our initial concepts and rough design, but in the end, we then take the initial ideas to a trusted graphic designer to complete the project. A good graphic designer will understand what different colors convey; how they interact with each other; and guide you towards the ideal color palette for your project. One thing that you will want to provide initially is your color preferences. Here's a summary of colors and the main words that they are usually associated with.

As you are picking some of the primary colors and design features, you will also want to double check that your design and colors aren't too similar to the competition around you: There's lots of tooth-shaped logos. There's also a good chance that even your creative graphic designer will design something that resembles what someone else already has. For this reason, it is important early on in the logo design process to familiarize yourself with the logos and names of the competition in the area and plot those out so that you can create a logo that is memorable and unique.

The signage on the outside of the building is very important because it is going to be one of the first things that the public will see when they pull up to your new practice. This is one area where we believe you should go the extra mile in making sure that it is reflective of the quality and type of dentistry that you will be doing: This could be a lighted box, or even higher end like custom cut-out letters that are each individually backlit. Typically a nice building-mounted sign will cost anywhere from $5,000-9,000, so make sure this is accounted for in your startup loan package.

# Roll Out Phase

Once you have your logo and branding established, you will want to begin strategizing the best ways to share your new brand with the existing patients and community at large. Obviously the
---
First communication with your patients after the transition will be a letter sent out to all patient families. We do not believe it is wise to try to rebrand in this letter: The goal of this correspondence should be to focus 100% on introducing the doctor and building up the authority and trust.

After a month or two, it might be a more appropriate time to roll out the new brand and name (if there is going to be a name change). As discussed in earlier chapters, we understand that cash flow is sometimes irregular in the beginning: For this reason, if you are planning a large rebranding effort; it might be more economical to change the website and print materials internally in the beginning. After those changes are made, you could change exterior signage shortly after: Plastic tarp-signs that cover older signage are a transitory step prior to investing in a new exterior signage.

# Hiring a Marketing Company/Person

# Questions to ask-

- Have you ever managed social media for a business?
- Walk me through the steps of how you would create an engaging Facebook post?
- Have you ever set up a Facebook ad? Or do you just 'boost' posts?
- When creating a Facebook ad, billboard and/or print ad, what kind of audience do you think you would want those ads to appeal to and how would you achieve that?
- What are the most important skills you have learned that you think would be important for this position?
- Are you more of a detail-oriented or big picture person? Why?
- Tell me about a time when you created content for an email and the process you went through to create it?
- How have you measured success in your current/past marketing role?
- Give an example of a goal you had to achieve in a marketing role and what steps you took to achieve it?
- What kind of management style do you prefer?
- What motivates you to work hard and do well?
- Tell me about a project you have worked on that you are most proud of?
- Tell me about a position you've held where you have managed multiple projects, vendors, and timelines.
- What do you do to stay organized?
- Do you prefer to do your own graphic design or work with graphic designers to execute projects?
- Tell me about a position where you worked with someone in a creative position and how you directed them to get the results you were looking for.
- Our priority is to give patients the best experience they can have when visiting us. What could you do in this position that could help give patients a positive experience?

While we have had amazing success and tragic failure with marketing people, if they are the right fit; we see great value in their expertise. We have found the best outcomes come from those that are intimately involved in your decision-making; and know you well. Larger companies often offer less individual attention and we've enjoyed working with smaller; high quality boutique firms. But; whether you hire someone to help or not; you'll need to keep the process moving along: While you can save a considerable amount of money by doing this yourself; be sure that you have the personal bandwidth to take on a project of this scope.

# The next step is budgeting and timing:

Calculate how much you'd like to invest in marketing each month; and create a calendar of what you'd like to focus on during specific periods of time:

- Where do you want the money to be spent? (internal or external marketing)
- How are you going to track which methods are effective and which are not?

Bigger investment = faster results and longevity of patients (reach more ideal patients)

# One element of the marketing system that we encourage you to focus on is keeping all of your ideas and marketing efforts in a large spreadsheet and using it to keep track of your results.

This data will allow you to pivot and eliminate underperforming efforts and increase resources to the most successful efforts. The table pictured here will help you to track your ideas and determine where you will want to spend money over the first few months. The next table shows all internal marketing and signage spend. Oftentimes internal marketing is more effective than external campaigns. Hopefully patients love meeting you as their new doctor; but to give away a YETI mug or bottle of wine sets you apart on an entirely different level. Remember that spending money on patients that are already in the chair can be a very good investment (However; if you're going to do a bulk purchase of any items like stainless steel mugs; tee-shirts or other branded materials, you should go through the rebranding process first:

# The next table pictured here shows some external marketing ideas

While it is not all encompassing, it will give you some idea of what you can do with some of your marketing spend: We do not encourage you to consider these types of campaigns in the first 6 months of an acquisition.

As you are pondering your marketing and possible rebranding efforts, remember that for the first 6-12 months of your transition, your entire goal is to minimize attrition of existing patients. Your primary objective should be to meet and gain the trust of hundreds or thousands of patients.

While getting new patients is great; your plate should be full trying to serve the existing patients. At some point between 3 and 6 months into the transition, your 'whirlwind' of activity will calm down, and you will have more time to focus on a rebranding effort. When you come to this point, you will surely want to set a budget: We do not suggest that you allocate a large amount of capital to do this. Rather; we believe that you should try to keep your normal marketing spend at a percentage up to 5%. The money you have budgeted for the 'rebrand phase' is going to be focused on branding; as opposed to building authority or patient acquisition.

The 'rebrand phase' of marketing should take no longer than a few months. Following this phase, attention can be shifted back to SEO, external marketing, internal marketing, and other traditional efforts of practice building:

# Continued Efforts

After getting stabilized and possibly rebranded, marketing techniques should begin to diversify with a focus on achieving an acceptable ROI on new patient acquisition. We typically recommend setting a budget of 4.5% of total revenue dedicated to marketing spend. In the practices that have underutilized spaces, or are in growth mode, this can be elevated for a period of time.

It's important to determine whether the practice can handle a large influx of new patients, and whether an increase in marketing spend is the right strategy: Percentages sometimes get as high as 10%-15% for a few months. When revenue begins to increase significantly; you can begin to dial the spending percentage back. As with everything in practice ownership, the location and market saturation will have a large effect on how aggressively you will need to market.

# Here are a few questions that you will want to answer when deciding the amount to budget for marketing spend:

- What is the cost difference between internal versus external marketing? We typically see a 25% spend internally, and a 75% spend externally: This 25% internal spend is described later in this chapter.
- Where is the best return on investment? The answer to this question is almost dependent on the demographic and the population that you will be serving: While there is an absolute formula, the foundation for almost all successful marketing is a good website.

# Web Presence

Your website and web presence is often your best return on investment: Although building a quality website can be costly; it often becomes the single largest referral source for most new practices. Usually a practice being purchased comes with a website. If the existing website is already gaining a lot of new patients and has a good history; it may be best to keep the existing provider or host. In these cases, make sure to gain ownership and control of the site on the day that you purchase the practice. If the seller does not grant access, it can be very challenging to gain control of the website if the seller has moved out of the area or becomes difficult to reach.

As you evaluate a company and or marketing coordinator; utilize the questionnaire in this chapter as a vetting tool. If the company you are using is well established in the dental profession, be sure to ask for references and ask about their experience. Most of these will be overwhelmingly positive, especially if the company provided them, but you may be able to get more specifics regarding their service.

# Website

Websites vary significantly based upon the primary focus and branding of the practice. The user experience for most websites however will be quite similar: Here are some general notes on websites and traffic patterns:

- Create a funnel for website traffic leading to a higher probability of scheduling.
- 50% of your website traffic will be to the doctor's "about" page followed by financially related details of the practice:

# The Personal Side

Mcet Dr Addison Killeen DDS
---
# CARYAL MERU

Show office fees on the website

Although it is rarely done, we believe that it is acceptable to post this information because it can potentially lead to a greater likelihood that a patient will schedule because they know what their financial obligation will be. This also may serve to build trust by demonstrating transparency:

# Giving You the Full Picture

# Preventative Care

Cleaning Exam; Full Series of X-Rays: Fluoride (DO1S0)

Emergency Exam Certiin PPO plans may cover 100%

Deep Cleaning (D43411) S0 = $302

Once your website is live, you'll need to evaluate its performance. Here are some of the details you'll need to track:

- Where is the traffic coming from?
- What is the bounce rate?
- What are the highest visited pages on the website?
- Is the traffic a result of phone calls leading to website visits or vice versa?

Phone calls require a 95% or higher answer rate, remember that missed calls equal missed opportunities to schedule.

One often-missed opportunity with many practices is not having an online scheduling option. In our experience, online scheduling options on dentist's websites result in not only more new patients, but Google and other search engines rank them higher:

Facebook

Similar to the website, make sure you are given instant Admin Access to the company Facebook page if there is one on the day you take ownership of the practice. At that point, remove all other parties who are Admin or Managers on the page.

Most target demographics for dental offices focus on the female 25-45 age range. This is also one of the largest demographics on the Facebook platform. For this reason, Facebook advertising should be part of your marketing plan.

It is key to establish an organic presence on Facebook; creating connections with the doctor at 228
---
Regular intervals every week. Most of them can be regular posts, with the occasional boosted post added to the mix. (As well as Facebook Ads:) Keep in mind that Facebook will typically not generate new patients instantly: The upside to utilizing Facebook is that it allows you to build a connection with a potential patient, which could then lead to a website visit and eventually a scheduled appointment:

# Facebook 'Reach'

Facebook 'Reach' is by far the most important statistic to monitor and track when periodically checking Facebook statistics.

# Google MyBusiness

Google is the largest platform in the world and can generate patients for you; or make you invisible to the world. In order to use it to your benefit; you'll want to use every tool that they offer to become as prominent as possible. Creating and maintaining a Google MyBusiness page is an important step:

During the transition process, be sure to also gain access to the Google MyBusiness page and remove any other users. After this is complete, you can use the page as a tool to generate new patients.

# Getting Reviews

Getting as many 5-star Google Reviews as possible is of the utmost importance. These reviews can move a new practice into the top ranking on Google without years and years of SEO and website history. Getting as many 4 and 5 star reviews as quickly as possible should be one of the top initiatives for you and your team:

# Utilizing Google Page Features

Many dentists underutilize certain aspects of the Google page. This includes the 'Products' page as well as any other links that you can input into the page. While most dentists do not sell "products" as a major part of their businesses, we do fillings, crowns, dentures, implants and other treatment that people are seeking. Be sure that your page has pictures, links, and prices for various types of procedures to ensure that Google ranks your website higher:

# Internal Marketing

Internal marketing can be instrumental in gaining new patient referrals for creating an amazing patient experience. Creating an exceptional patient experience will also increase the likelihood that patients will leave positive, 5-star Google reviews.

# Strategies for Internal Marketing

So, what strategies can we deploy in internal marketing to help create an unforgettable patient experience? It starts with systems like the phone scripts, the new patient tour; developing connections with patients in the office, and reducing discomfort (sedation or painless injections). It also includes some things that might not typically be included in marketing:

# Patient Experience

Obviously you and your team must create a great patient experience from beginning to end, engage in real personal interaction, CARE about your patients, and work on connecting with people at a deeper level. If you do that; no matter how it's executed, your patients will become raving fans.

# Scripts for Phone

There are only a few categories where most callers fall into; work to develop and role play scripts that account for each type of caller: This should be part of your operations manual.

# Transfer of Trust Scripts

During each transition in the patient flow; you should perform a transfer of trust. This should include edification of the team member that you are handing off to. This should also be in your operations manual.

# Texting/Voicemails After Difficult Procedures

After any procedure requiring anesthesia, the doctor or staff should text or call the patient to check in. This is one of the most well-regarded gestures of kindness and empathy. If you don't want patients to have your direct cell phone number; you can always use a Google phone number for patient-only contact.

# Continuity of Brand In-Office

Internal Office Paperwork: Brochures and items that are custom branded do your office. These could include informational brochures on extractions, implants, sleep apnea, caries risk, periodontal risk.

# Business Cards/Reappointment Cards

Custom business cards are commonplace these days. Remember that the quality of the card is often associated with the quality of perceived care that patients will receive in your office. Do not go cheap on these, invest in a higher quality card, heavier stock, etc. Also make sure that they look professional and do not have pixelated images or poor quality printing:

# CAPITAL DENTAL

# Patient Giveaways:

# T-shirts

In our offices we give away t-shirts intermittently: We create new t-shirt designs every few months that have attractive images on them associated with the season. Staff love them, and when given out, they are rolled up, tied with a bow, and a business card. (About $6.50 per t-shirt is the cost:) These are more expensive than other giveaways, but they become walking billboards for you and have a very high perceived value.

# RolioraptoR Smile

# Wine

We go to Trader Joe's or other stores and purchase cases of inexpensive bottles of wine then wrap them in a clear plastic bag from Amazon.com, place a nice sticker on the bottle, and tie them up with a bow. Each employee gives out a bottle of wine per day. It's part of their daily checklist to give one out to anyone they choose.

# Steel-insulated Cups

Go to Alibaba.com to purchase, or else use my contact at this company. They are about $4.50 for a 20 oz. mug that is EXACTLY the same as Hydroflask (They are prohibited from printing Hydroflask on the bottle).

# Google/Facebook Reviews

We have found that Swell is the most effective software for getting more Google reviews. Although there are many options, Swell does a great job in getting reviews faster than any other texting-solution.

# Giveaways

Our most popular giveaway is a YETI Cooler; place it somewhere conspicuous in the office with a sign that explains that each month or two you will give it away to a lucky winner. To enter, simply leave a Google review.

# Email Batching to Patients

Use a service to pull all emails from the past 6 months, send them emails like MailChimp or ActiveCampaign to send emails to these patients if you do not have a service like Flex. These emails should thank them for being patient, and remind them how important Google reviews are to your business. In this email, tell them how much reviews mean to your business and ask them if they would kindly write a review for you.
---
# Cards to Patients:

# New Patients

Custom printed cards with a message of gratitude and additional space to customize. Must be high quality card-stock

Hello,

Dear (patient),

Thank you so much for referring a friend to our clinic recently: means a lot that you trust us with your care, and in turn tell other people about us. As a gesture of our appreciation, grab a smoothie or coffee on us; Enjoy!

Thanks,

Dr. Costes & Team

# Special Occasions

Using the same card as above, a staff member can write a personalized message for a special occasion occurring in the patient's life, a get well message, or condolences for a lost family member.

Although these internal strategies seem like overkill to the typical general dental practice, we believe that they create an amazing patient experience that goes far beyond what other practices are willing to do. When this much focus is placed on recognizing patients, the dividends of your kindness, empathy, and attention will pay off for decades.

# External Marketing

Some external marketing campaigns can generate many new patients, and some can be a complete dud. Finding out which type of marketing generates a favorable ROI and which does not can take time and lots of trial and error. Most strategies are market and demographic specific so testing and tracking are imperative.

Here's a few of the methods that we have tried in the past:

# Google Ads

While it is important to make sure to stay within a certain budget, Google Ads typically provide a favorable return on investment.

# Facebook Ads

These are a useful, low-cost marketing strategy to generate more awareness about your practice; a budget of around $300 per month is usually sufficient.

# Postcards

# Marketing Strategies

# Postcards

Postcards can be very successful with some demographics: If results are positive in the first few attempts, repeat 5-6 times. After this initial wave, decrease frequency to every 2-3 months. People who are 20-55 respond surprisingly well to postcards.

# Billboards

Billboards offer mixed results but can be effective in some markets. Cost can range from $600-4,000 a month depending on the traffic and size of your market: We have not seen great return on investment from radio ads.

# Guerrilla Marketing

Creative and unconventional marketing strategies that cost very little. They sometimes work well; but can be difficult to measure.

# Tracking Return on Investment

The most important element to a successful marketing plan is to ensure that each avenue of marketing is measured and the effectiveness compared. In order to do this accurately, you will need to keep track of your spending, and how each patient ended up in your practice. Part of this analysis includes your website and phone number: For tracking purposes we suggest that you place customized phone numbers on them. Using different phone numbers allows you to track exactly where each new patient is coming from: Note: This tracking strategy can cause confusion in the patient base if too many tracking numbers are being used at one time, so do your best to limit the tracking numbers as much as possible.

The tried and true method of tracking is to simply ask the patient how they heard about your office. Once they share this information with the team, it should be documented in the patient's chart.

Another way to track return on investment is by delineating the value of each patient. For example, if you are marketing for 'All on X' procedures, these patients are worth much more than the typical cleaning patient: Tracking the type of production that each of these patients is completing is also important.

Here are some of the charts that we use in our evaluation of marketing effectiveness. In general, we have noted that the more visitors to a website usually means more new patients, which leads to more production and revenues. When you see a graph like the one above, you'll know that things are going well for a practice, as web visits are begetting production. All lines are moving in a positive direction:

# Position Tracking: Top Competitors Chart

Some marketers only measure "leads" generated by their marketing efforts. These reports shown here are quite different: The first one shows a market research type graph of your website total traffic from search websites versus those of your competition. This is compiled by our website firm, and they do this analytics dump each month and email us the results.

Although effectiveness is sometimes measured by whether you are showing up in the top 3 of any given search term, these results can be misleading: Many people use the search terms 'dentist' and the city and state. The cumulative addition of all other dental search terms however dwarfs this number: If you are only focused on being the #1 dentist if someone searches 'dentist san antonio tx' for instance, you may be missing out on many other leads that might be valuable if other search terms were used.

A strategy that attacks many keywords at the same time can actually get more web traffic across multiple search terms; as opposed to having all of your SEO focus on just one type of search.

In all, effective marketing can potentially be one of the factors that skyrockets your business to new heights. To execute this correctly, it will require a focus on branding; external marketing, internal marketing, tracking:

# As the Whirlwind Slows

In their book; the 4 Disciplines of Execution, Chris McChesney; Jim Huling, and Sean Covey describe a phenomenon that they call the "whirlwind." This term refers to the frenzy that occurs every day in a busy business environment: In a dental office, this includes simultaneously managing the team, the patients, the vendors, clinical care, and overall business operations. The reality of being a dentist in a transition can be overwhelming and exhausting. Having been through many start-ups and acquisitions—both smooth and turbulent—we know first hand that there will always be obstacles, challenges, and stressful moments.

We also know that as you work in a practice over time, the whirlwind will eventually calm down. As it does, you will get the opportunity to expand your focus to other aspects within the practice that require attention. The best place to start in order to move from chaos to efficiency and order is the implementation of systems:

# Systemization

Contrary to popular belief, operational systemization is not a finite practice. It is rather an ongoing fluid process that is constantly changing and evolving as your practice, team, and skill-set changes and evolves. While we've written an entire manual dedicated to systemization (The Dental Operations Manual), in the pages that follow, we will give you an overview of our Elite Practice Blueprint, which is the foundational framework for turning your practice into an efficient, profitable, sophisticated business.

# Prioritization

Next, you will see the major categories of the Elite Practice Blueprint: Foundation, Operational Systemization, Lifetime Patient Experience, New Patient Acquisition, Human Resources, and Overhead and Cash Flow control:
---
# Ttnntdr Sl 40J Calb

# Operational Lifetime Foundation

# Systerization Patient Experience

# DSI Elite Practice Blueprint

# New Patient Acquisition

# Human Resources Overhead Cash Flow Control

The pages that follow will give printed examples on digital access to several documents that will help you to master all six pillars of the Elite Practice Blueprint: If you haven't already done so, pick up a copy of The Dental Practice Operations Manual for a deep dive into each category and process.

# Sample Table of Contents Includes:

- Foundational Principles
- Organizational Chart
- Protocol Sheets
- Accountability Agreements
- Patient Experience and Phone Scripts
- Monthly Performance Reviews
- Ideal Set-Up Pictures
- Common Area Pictures
- End of Day Protocol
- Downtime Protocol
- Universal Onboarding Documents
- Positional Onboarding

# Organizational Chart

From day one you will want to have an organizational chart: Here are some main points to consider:

- As CEO you should strive to have the smallest number of people reporting directly to you as possible.
- No more than one person should fill a role, but a person can fill more than one role.
- A person can have more than one direct supervisor from different departments.

(clinicalladministration)

To create your own organizational chart; follow these steps:

1. List out all positions in your organization.
2. Give each employee a title.
3. Designate a lead for each department.
4. Draw out organizational chart according to your practice's internal hierarchy.

An example is below:

# Example Dental

As you go about the process of doing this yourself; we have found it beneficial to use the software called LucidChart to help create beautiful flowcharts like this.

# Systemization Jumpstart

Rather than fill hundreds of more pages in this book on systemization, we suggest that you model what has already been built: Remember that members of the Dental Success Network get access to the Operations Manual Templates. To get immediate access, simply head to the website and sign up for a free trial and feel free to download any documents that you need: There are hundreds of pages of documents to help jumpstart your own operations manual.

One of the best ways to avoid getting lost and overwhelmed during the systemization process we suggest downloading the systemization jumpstart. This packet includes daily checklists, patient experience touch-points, and follow the dollar exercises. By far the most impactful are the daily checklists. These lists are meant to remind each team member of exactly what should be focusing on throughout the day: This can include a morning protocol, down-time protocol, and end of day protocol.

Here is a copy of the Daily Task list for a clinical assistant and front office assistant. These were created on Google Sheets, and can be copied from the DSN document vault: Use these as the framework for building your own, and look at other tabs in the document to see what other checklists you could create for your practice.

# Creating a Systemized Practice

Once you've created your daily task lists, continue on with other aspects of creating a systemized practice. The flow chart below shows some of the biggest items to focus on your acquisition journey:

# Identity Systems to be Created

- Great Systems
- Organize Systems
- Implement Training
- Management Accountability
- Ongoing Refinement

# Patient Touch Point Exercise

In this exercise, follow a patient from their first interaction with your practice, throughout the process, up until they pay and leave with a rescheduled appointment. In general, you will want a rough script for each touchpoint. For example, sometimes a patient will call and request an appointment and is ready to schedule. This is straightforward and the person answering the phone will get them scheduled.

However, a caller wants to know prices and insurance information. For these cases, the team must have adequate training to field these types of questions.
---
# Main Touch Points

- First phone call
- Reminder phone call
- Greeting when entering practice
- Calling patient back to the operatory
- Patient Tour of the practice upon first visit
- Seating Patient into the Chair; Building rapport
- Handoff from Assistant to Doctor
- Handoff from Doctor to Treatment Coordinator
- Collecting at the end of the appointment
- Rescheduling at the end of the appointment
- Walking out and finishing up appointment

# Follow the Dollar Exercise

This exercise is similar to the Patient Touch Point exercise but from a financial perspective. You will need to list in order each time money or payment is discussed, billed, or collected as well as the team member associated with the task: Here's an example sheet you can copy and work through:

# Time Journal Exercise

DSI CEO/Doctor me JouAMAl

For a period of five days, journal your activities from the time that you wake up until the time you go to sleep. Highlight in yellow, all of the activities that can be eliminated or delegated out for less than $100 (or what you think your hour is worth). Highlight in blue, all of the activities that cannot be eliminated or delegated out for less than $100.

Definitions: Yellow time - low value activities, Blue time - high value activities, White time - Free time. The goal is to replace as much yellow time with white time and blue time.

# Team Protocol Sheet

For a period of three days, have each team member journal their activities from the time that they arrive at work until the time that they leave.
---
Schedule a meeting with each team member to review their journal.

Identify tasks that are continuously repeated throughout the day; redundancies, inefficiencies and overlaps in operations.

Name each chunk of tasks (verifying insurance, setting up treatment rooms, etc.):

Allot time and give a deadline for each team member to summarize how they perform each chunk of tasks.

Schedule a follow-up meeting with each team member and review their summaries and convert them into checklists and protocols (their feedback and authorship is key in this step).

While this is far from an all-inclusive list of systems that need to be created to run a smooth and profitable operation, it is a good start. As mentioned earlier; you will never be "finished" with this process as you will forever be growing, changing and evolving as a team, owner and practice.

# Hiring and Onboarding New Team

It is an understatement to say that the job market has been on a roller coaster for the past few years. We have heard from many dentists around the nation that finding qualified employees is now tougher than ever: Many report that they struggle to even get applicants to show up for interviews.

It is not uncommon to experience 100% turnover of your team members in the first two years of ownership. With this in mind, it is important that you are extremely well versed in systems to hire, onboard, and run the 'people' side of your business.

In order to lead an organization effectively, it is important that you clearly convey your expectations for each role within the practice. Designing onboarding protocols and systems with this in mind will greatly increase the likelihood that your team members will be successful in their positions.

Putting together all of these hiring and onboarding documents can be mind-boggling. This chapter is dedicated to simplifying the important and complex topics. Below is a list of the elements that are important to include in the Hiring and Onboarding portion of your practice's operations manual:

- Organizational Chart
- Job Descriptions
- Hiring Advertisements
- Interview Process
- Onboarding Process
- Specially for Startups - what are the first positions to hire for?
---
It is important to remember that each place on the org chart can only be occupied by one person, however a person can reside in more than one place. If we were to turn this example into an image, it would be shown to the side here. In essence, your new office manager can also be your 1. Insurance Verification, 2. Scheduler; 3. Biller; and 4. Treatment Coordinator: So one person can sit in 5 or more seats, but there should not be two office managers.

Once we have the positions defined by name, we must clearly define the duties associated with each role. This will need to be described in careful detail and reviewed with each team member:

# Job Description

A job description is quite simply the list of tasks for a job. If you currently work at a practice prior to acquisition, observe the varying tasks that are being performed by each team member and list those out in careful detail. The more detail that you can include, the greater the likelihood that those duties will be completed thoroughly and correctly:

When creating ideal Job Descriptions we have found it helpful to envision your "perfect" team member: What qualities does he or she possess? How do they work with other team members? During this process, determine which traits are non-negotiable versus which are just a bonus. Having these parameters clean to the interviewing process will almost always save time and produce a superior team:

At the end of this chapter we have included examples of job descriptions for Dental Assistants, Hygienists and Front Office Coordinators.

# Hiring is Marketing

When you begin recruiting to fill a position on your team, it is important to attract the most qualified applicants possible. To make sure that this occurs, you will need to take off your administrator's hat and start thinking like a marketer. Crafting a story that allows the potential team member to envision themselves on the team typically produces great results. Explicitly describing the culture and values of the office and the fact that you value the community and provide exceptional care to the patients will also separate your post from the more traditional "help wanted" ad.

Here's the major items to include in the job advertisement:

- Job listing headline
- Position and practice overview
- Responsibilities/expectations
- Job skill requirements
- Compensation
- Salary expectations are for that position

Use Payscale.com to compare what current salary expectations are for that position.

# Advertisement Strategy

In this ad, you will notice we hit all the major points. "Selling" the office to the prospective applicant is very important. Sharing the required skills is next. Sprinkled in there are a few special instructions to see if they can follow directions. If they complete these tasks, it shows that they have an attention to detail that is above average. Now that you have the advertisement written, you will need to decide where to place it. Here's what has worked well for us:

- Indeed
- Craigslist
- Facebook
- - Private ads
- Facebook groups

Local Job Boards
- Google for your area - any schools?
- Professional Organizations
- State Dental Board

# Interview Process

Once you start getting applicants, you can begin the interview process. For positions that you need to be filled on opening day, start the process about 2.5 months before your projected start day. Planning this far out will give you sufficient time to interview without having to be rushed into making a hiring decision.

# Steps to the Interview Process

- Phone Interview
- Skills Testing
- In-Person Interview
- Reference Check
- Background Check
- Working Interview (In some scenarios)

# Phone Interview

The phone interview is the step in the process that can actually save you time.

down the road. It should be a quick (less than 10 minute) phone call with an applicant that quickly covers the highlights of the job and their history and background: During the phone interview you will want to gather this information:

- What is their pay range?
- When could they potentially start?
- Do they have acceptable people skills?
- Do you have a good feeling about them?

When going through this process, we like to have a quick phone interview sheet to use as a framework during the call. See below:

(Check out the document vault for the phone and in-person interview help sheets)

# Phone Interview

Reason for wanting to change:

Energy  1 2 3 4 5

Tell me a bit about yourself?

What attracted you to apply for this position?

How would you describe your work style?

What can you tell me that isn't on your resume that is important for me to know about you?

Why are you leaving your job/why are you looking elsewhere?

What questions can I answer for you?

Once they have completed the phone interview; you will want to let them know as quickly as possible whether they will continue on in the process or not: if they are to continue on, you will want to email them the skills assessment link:

# Skills and Personality Testing

As you consider the skills and personality testing format; you will have two different options. One is the free option, which could include websites like 16personalities.com or online DISC assessments. In these assessments, you will get personality testing and a fairly good feel for the applicants. These aren't overly descriptive however; and may leave you wanting more information.

On the skills testing side, we haven't found any free tests out there. However, if you have the time, you could always write your own skills tests, and see if applicants can complete a series of specific tasks. For example, you could deliver a series of instructions about creating a spreadsheet in Excel, and see if the applicant can complete it and email the file back to you:

# Here's some quick notes on free tests:

- Personality tests
- DISC
- Quick, simple and to the point
- 16personalities.com
- In depth
- Skills test
- Shows how they operate in different environments
- Build your own

As you look at paid resources, there are a couple of good choices. The best one that we've come across is called HireSelect by the Criteria Corporation: The tests given out by HireSelect are both high in quality and in the range of tests they offer. They can do multiple different types of personality tests that are rated against the job you are hiring for. They can also give skills tests on Word, Excel, Web knowledge, computer literacy, and typing speed. Here's a quick summary of the options you have for testing:

# In-Person Interview

The in-person interview can be stressful and haphazard the first few times that you do it; but as with most things - systemization works. Here are the major points regarding an in-person interview that has helped us through the years:

# Ask the applicant to explain what the position is or entails in their own words.

# Questions to ask during the interview:

- Can you tell us about yourself?
- Explain what drew you to this position.
- Can you give me an example of a time that you made a mistake and how you handled it?
- How comfortable are you in your skills with (position required skill)?

# Role playing scenarios based on position:

- Back office - Have the applicant present a treatment plan like they would a patient and explain financing and insurance coverage.
- Front office - Have interviewee check a patient out, schedule next appointment; collect payment; and answer an "incoming phone call".
- Office manager - Have interviewee role play a call with a difficult patient who wants a refund or a situation where they must confront a subordinate about a mistake that was made.

# Compensation:

- When you left your previous position what was your level of compensation?
- What is your preferred compensation range for this position?
- Do you mind if we contact your previous employer? If no, why not?

# Don't ignore a gut feeling

Attached in the document vault is the In-Person interview help sheet: Take, customize, and use this sheet as you go through the interview process with applicants. Since in many instances you will not have an office yet; try to do the interviews at a coffee shop or other fast-style restaurant.

# After the interview process:

You will want to check references. While this is mostly a routine exercise, you will sometimes find out interesting facts about an applicant: These are usually 5 minute phone calls, and is an important part of the process that should not be skipped:

- Always check references.
- Call previous employers:

---
# Background Check

If the applicant has references, then the next step is the background check: This step is usually relatively inexpensive, but should always be done. The cost is typically $12-25 based upon the number of states they have lived in.

This is how we approach the background check with potential employees, "At this point in the process we run background checks on all potential applicants, and will run yours today since you are at the final stages of the interview process. Is there anything should know about that may come up on the background check?"

With this statement, you will give them an opportunity to explain anything that may appear on their report, but it's also the way they address a potential issue. When nothing is shared and a negative report is delivered, we typically eliminate that applicant from contention: In many instances, you will also want a working interview: This is only applicable after you own an office, but the working interview can often help to demonstrate how a potential applicant will handle real life situations.

# Here are some notes on working interviews:

- Regarding compensation, find the range and pay them towards the lower end for the first paycheck
- If hired, can add working interview compensation to
- If not hired, have check ready for end of day
- Test direct skills- back office skills, insurance verification skills, phone skills, etc

If the applicant feels like a good match, you can offer them a position. This can be done verbally and followed up with a written offer letter:

# Offer Letter

Here's an example offer letter that you can edit for your own purposes. Sometimes the legalities of this type of letter differs from state to state so make sure to have a state-specific HR professional take a look before you send it off.

# Onboarding

The onboarding process in many dental practices is broken or non-existent. It often consists of a mix of instructions to 'follow-the-trainer' and 'watch me do this once'. After the new employee watches one of your team members a few times, they are often expected to know exactly what to do and how to do it.

A much more effective and efficient way to onboard team members involves proactively creating systems that help train and support an employee with clarity and clear expectations. These expectations should be very detailed, and time bound. In our sample documents, we have laid out these benchmarks in a 30-60-90 day format. These expectations specify what proficiencies are at 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days. The 30 day list is relatively rudimentary: At 60 days, they will be expected to know and be proficient in all items from the 30 days list, plus added responsibilities, skills, and knowledge applicable for a more seasoned employee. At 90 days, the employee should 'graduate' from the official onboarding process and become a full-fledged employee. If they cannot complete many of the duties of the 90 day checklist, however, they can be kept on probation for another 30 days. If there are multiple points of failure it may be time to consider termination so that you can free them to seek a position where they can succeed.

Throughout the process, you will need to have an infrastructure in place that will facilitate growth and proficiency. Here's a quick list of considerations to reflect upon throughout this process:

- What does success in this position look like?
- Have all resources been provided to facilitate success?
- - Education - Show; tell, do
- Online Videos
- Written Workbooks

Set benchmarks and deadlines for skills proficiency
- - 30, 60, 90 Benchmarks

Pair with a mentor
- - Make sure mentor/mentee are working well together

Recognize progress
- - Be positive and not always correcting mistakes

Encourage questions and feedback
- - Make sure the new hire is being heard

Maintain disciplined adherence to the onboarding cadence

At the beginning of the onboarding process, we recommend having everything in a packet for review and to give to them on their first day: This includes all the administrative HR packets and other checklists, documents, and the 30-60-90 day benchmarks. Below is a list of items that you might consider including in an onboarding packet:
---
# Universal Onboarding Checklist

# History of practice

# Practice owners bio

# Team members and positions

- Ask staff for their bio for the new hire to get to know them
- Ask for a bio from the new hire

# Foundational Principles

# Handbook Policies

# Benefit package Information

# Meetings and performance reviews on schedule

# Onboarding scheduled with (Mentor)

# Positional Onboarding

The training should include but is not limited to:

- Patient touch points and verbiage
- Protocol sheets for each set of duties they will encounter
- Accountability agreements
- 30-60-90 day expectations
- Weekly benchmarks and check-ins

# Onboarding Cadence

- days Universal Onboarding-Universal trainer
- Positional training 90 days
- Weekly check-ins with trainer/supervisor
- Participation in weekly team growth meetings (lead measures)
- Monthly performance reviews with 30/60/90 day assessments
- Ongoing cultural, procedural/clinical mentorship guidance

This is an exhaustive list, feel free to include, exclude or customize as you see fit: On the next few pages you will see an example packet for the Dental Assistant position, and there are specific packets for other positions in the online document vault:

# Here's the list of items that we include in the Onboarding Folder for each position of the practice:

- Welcome Emails per position
- Universal Onboarding Document
- Book per position

# Sample Welcome Email:

Hello!

We are glad you've decided to join the Capital Dental team! We have an amazing team dedicated to creating a better dental experience, and we hope that you can get up to speed with our systems so that you feel comfortable from the first day:

You should have received an email from our payroll service 'Gusto' which will allow you to accept the job offer, as well as put in all your personal information. It's all done digitally now; so make sure to find that email in case it might have gone to your spam folder. (Remember on your first day to also bring 2 forms of ID as well - Drivers License, Social Security Card, or Passport)

So first things first, we run on a set of core values that are the most important rules that we live by in the practice. We also have a mission and vision for where these rules will take us as we grow: Read this MissionVision_Core_Values document; there may be a test - so memorizing these is a good idea.

To get a general sense of how we run as an office and how to do a few things around the office, we created a Universal On-Boarding document: Read that HERE. With any job, there's usually a legalese manual. It's boring and filled with a bunch of policies; however, it does cover a lot of what it means to be an employee with our company: So grab a coffee and read that HERE.

For your position as a Dental Assistant, there's a few documents that outline exactly what you will be doing as well as a few videos that will help you understand Open Dental better. Read and watch those below:

- Job Description for Dental Assistant
- Clinical Setups
- OD Video Overview
- OD Clinical Videos
- Clinical 1 - Entering Tx
- Clinical 2 - Clinical Notes

If you have any certifications for your degree or skills, like radiology or coronal polishing, please bring a copy of that on your first day as well.

All our doctors and hygienists run by a general set of guidelines set up by our Doctors: We tried to codify these diagnoses and treatments as much as possible. It's a huge book; and is really just a primer on what and how to do things. It's not required reading but if you ever want to flip through it, you can read it HERE.

Overall we run a different sort of practice. It's based on the first core value of 'Fantastic Guest Experience'. All the systems listed above create a guest experience that is relaxing, well-timed, and smooth: We want every player on the team to be an All-star; and we feel these systems get us there.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us, Dr. Buyer at (402) XXX-XXXX or Dr. Associate at (402) XXX-XXXX.

Thank you again, we look forward to starting this adventure with you!

Each chair is pre-programmed to tip the pt back and set them up per the Dr's preference

1. Click the A on either side of the back of the chair to tip the pt back
2. Click the E on either side of the back of the chair to sit the patient back up
3. Adjust the tilt or base of the chair with the respective arrow buttons

# Why Surgical Chairs are different

The base of the surgical chairs raise all the way up so the doc/assistant can stand for surgery

# 13. How Suction and Pumps Work

Pumps are turned off each night by the last person out of the office, and turned back on again by the first person to arrive the next morning. On/off buttons located right next to the back door. Traps are changed weekly in each operatory - you are responsible for your own room.

# 14. How Sterilization works/flows

The lab is the start of the sterilization area, the lab is included in the "dirty side" of sterilization. Starts with the grinder sink, vibrating machine/lab handpiece/suck down stint machine. "Dirty side" continues to ultrasonic unit sink packaging area. Two ultraclaves separate the dirty side of sterilization from the clean side (NO DIRTY GLOVES SHOULD TOUCH THESE MACHINES). Open/remove trays with clean ungloved hand, load trays with gloved dirty hand. Ultraclaves are unloaded to sterilization, items will then be placed on trays or put away in clean cupboard to the right of the counter.

# 20. Flow of a Patient through the office

Pt enters the practice and checks in with front desk.

Assistant/Hygienist brings pt back (gives office tour if new patient) and seats them in the operatory.

If possible the assistant will check pt out for services completed that day.

Hygiene will be trained to check out for fluoride to avoid congestion at check out up front.

If not able to check pt out (questions/large balance) bring pt up to the front to one of the two check out stations.

If no one is available at the designated checkout take pt to front desk or seat pt in waiting room and let them know that someone will be with them asap.

Leave completed routing slip with Tacia face down at her desk so she knows to help your pt next.

# Chapter 12

# What to do When.

There are countless unanticipated situations that occur during dental practice transitions. We took some of our experiences as well as some compiled from selected members of DSN and shared them in this chapter: Hopefully you will learn some lessons as well as a good laugh or two from the stories in this chapter.

# 15 Minutes Late is Okay

A doctor once told us that his patient base had been "trained" by the previous owner and team to be consistently late. This scenario occurs for a number of different reasons ranging from poor team communication to the absence of consequences for undesired behavior. The first step to rectifying this trend is to begin to communicate the new expectations to the patient base and to role play the appropriate language with the team. A firm but reasonable response to a patient may sound something like this:

Thank you for letting us know that you'll be 15 minutes late, Mrs. Jones. Since we only had 60 minutes scheduled with Dr. Buyer for this appointment, unfortunately we will not be able to complete the entire treatment we had planned for today. We are booked solid so in respect to our other patients, we have to stay on schedule.

Handling a situation in this manner demonstrates to the patient that your time is valuable and that other people are affected by their tardiness. Secondarily, this also shows that you are a busy practitioner that cares for many people. This further adds to your authority and the value patients place on your time. After all, no one wants to be treated by a dentist that isn't regarded highly enough to have an extremely busy practice.

It is also important to establish set policies for scenarios that are bound to arise regarding late patients and rescheduling. Let's say for instance that a patient walks in at 9:15 for their 9:00 appointment: What's your policy? How late can a patient be and still be treated?
---
# Suggestions:

Here are some suggestions:

A patient will be reappointed if they show up more than 15 minutes past their appointment time. A patient should be scheduled a minimum of 4 weeks out when they are rescheduled for missing an appointment: This will cause an inconvenience for the patient being late or reinforce the value of your time and the importance of arriving on time.

If a patient is a repeat offender for showing up late or missing appointments, allow them to schedule only on a same day basis. Overall, communication and consistency will be the key ingredients to controlling patient behavior: Some patients will conform very quickly to the new policies while others will not. In the latter cases it is better in the long run to allow patients who do not respect you or your team's time to leave the practice.

# Payment Due

One of the fastest ways to find yourself in a cash-flow or accounts receivables crisis is the "We will send you a bill" policy: The supermarket won't send you a bill for your groceries. They expect payment at the time you receive your goods. In much the same way; it's imperative to collect the patient's payments, whether it's fee-for-service or the PPO deductible and co-pay at the time of service. Once again, communication, scripting and role playing with the team is your best ally in enforcing this office policy:

The conversation can be as simple as this: 'Mrs. Jones, it's so nice to see you today! Our policy is to collect the patient portion at the time of service. It looks like we have you here for this procedure today and your portion will be this amount: How would you like to take care of that?'

Because of HIPAA regulations, we do not discuss specifics about a patient's treatment or cost of procedure out loud in the presence of other patients. For this reason, we provide the point information on the route sheet without reading it aloud:

Some practices take a deposit in order to reserve the doctor's time when the appointment is made and some offices even have success collecting the entire payment at the time of scheduling: While this does not work for all offices, others have executed this well.

# The Bloody Prophy Practice

One of the biggest challenges that new practice owners face is educating patients about periodontal disease and introducing periodontal protocols into a practice. This is particularly challenging when the previous ownership has not been diagnosing or treating appropriately:

A metric that we always check during our due diligence period prior to purchasing a practice or when coaching a member through a transition is periodontal procedure percentage. If this number is in the single digits or low double digits, we know we are most likely dealing with a bloody prophy practice. In many cases it seems as though these practices have denied the existence of periodontal disease for years if not decades. Often, patients of these practices were treated with a routine prophylaxis without knowing that they had deep pocketing, bleeding.
---
or probing and significant bone loss. Once again, communication is very important in education and conversion of these patients to appropriate care and stabilization of their condition. A conversation may sound something like this:

"Mrs. Schmidt; when we do our exams, we start by checking the foundation first which is the gums and bone before moving to the teeth. When looking at your gum tissue, we are seeing many areas of puffiness and bleeding. You may have noticed some of the numbers that Mary was calling out when she was checking the health of your gum tissue. Numbers 1-3 indicate a normal area, 4 indicates borderline and 5 and above indicates gum disease and infection. This basically indicates that the gum tissue is pulling away from the bone creating inflammation and infection called periodontal disease. The reason that this occurs is...

As you explain the root causes and consequences of periodontal disease, expect Mrs. Schmidt to ask; just had a check-up and cleaning 6 months ago, why didn't Dr: Seller tell me about this?" A good reply would sound something like this:

"Many dentists like to be as conservative as possible by not recommending any unnecessary treatment and this is a good thing, but WHAT WE NOW KNOW; is that untreated periodontal disease will not only lead to bad breath and tooth loss; it also is very dangerous for your overall health. In fact, studies have found that it can lead to a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes; and many other chronic diseases."

A nice addition to this script is from the book Beat the Heart Attack Gene by Dr: Bradley Bale and Amy Doneen: There are a handful of pages that can be referenced, copied, and shaped with your more skeptical patients. While it may take a significant investment in time, your patience and consistent message will eventually lead to a much healthier patient base under your care.

# Amalgam Crowns

A familiar scenario that we see play out over and over again in practices sold by late career dentists is the "watch and patch" practice. Much like the "Bloody Prohy Practice," these practices have evolved away from proactive restorative practices into observe and patchwork practices that provide the minimal amount of dentistry possible in order to keep the patient in function. As we have all learned in dental school, providing this type of care has its place as a temporary fix in emergency situations or in community-based clinic settings or missionary dental settings when there is no other alternative. But what we also know is that putting off inevitable treatment can lead to much larger and even more expensive procedures or permanent tooth loss.

Utilizing an intraoral camera is probably the most helpful tool in creating urgency and showing the patient exactly why you are making the recommendations you are making. Additionally, when presenting their treatment options, try to present what could potentially occur as far as additional costs (RCI, surgical extraction, bone graft, implant placement, etc.) if they wait too long to proceed with the treatment.
---
If a patient still persists in asking for patchwork treatment; you can simply say something like, "I'm sorry Mrs. Schmidt; I believe that what you are asking is below the standard of care and don't feel comfortable with that compromise." While this is a hard line, it may be necessary at times depending on the situation.

# I'm Retiring, You Get a Raise!

One of our DSN Members shared a situation that she had to deal with early in her ownership journey: Shortly after the purchase of a dental practice, she discovered that the departing doctor gave the entire staff significant pay increases just prior to the transition. This was obviously an unanticipated surprise and put her in quite a precarious situation. She ultimately had to have some difficult conversations and it added more stress to an already stressful time.

In order to decrease the likelihood that this happens to you; be certain that the seller has given you information about the staff's pay rates and any benefits all the way up to the date of closing. There are documents in Chapter 2 and contracts in Chapter 4 that will help you through this process.

# The Landlord from Hell

In many transitions the selling doctor will sell their practice but retain the real estate as an investment and rent it back to the buyer. This can be an ideal arrangement but there are occasions when it doesn't go so smoothly:

We have heard stories and personally dealt with landlords that were unresponsive or unwilling to deal with issues relating to the property: From AC units, to leaky faucets, to cracking walls, to foundation issues. At the end of the lease term the landlord might not be open to extending the lease or to renegotiating the terms moving forward. (This happened to both of us.)

In order to protect yourself, your personal Board of Directors should include a real estate attorney and a lease negotiator. Being represented by a professional with this type of expertise will definitely decrease your stress and the likelihood that you'll be taken advantage of.

# Welcome to Business Ownership!

One particular story that drives home the importance of being adequately prepared for as many contingencies as possible came to us from a DSN Member in the midwest: Here is his account in his own words:

I had just purchased my practice and building and was leaving my previous practice to meet my new team at my new practice. I had a feeling of joy and excitement that comes from accomplishing a goal that I had envisioned since the day I started dental school. There was a light snowfall which gave a white blanket of brightness to the winter dreariness. I knew that this was going to be the beginning of a new chapter; a journey filled with ups and downs and new challenges.
---
opportunities for growth. had not even stepped foot in the practice as the new owner yet when got a call from the seller He calmly informed me that the sewage pump in the basement of my new building was broken and it had happened in the hour since we had signed all the closing documents. Raw sewage was now backing up into the basement and as the new owner of the building; it was my responsibility to take care of it. Luckymel The joys of business and building ownership started pretty much right away for mel

When becoming a practice and building owner; it's important to have a plan in place that is triggered in the event of an emergency: Assembling a reliable and trustworthy group of repair companies and trade-specific specialists is a great place to start: If something breaks on your dental delivery unit who will you call? If there's an electrical issue who will be your go-to contact? If a toilet is broken or overflowing; who will be your preferred plumber? If water starts spewing out of a faucet or wall, where is the shut off valve?

Once you have put together your list of contacts, it's important that each person on your team knows where to find it and understands basic building emergency procedures and who to call if the doctor/owner is not available. We have also had good success taking a simple video walk through of the building with specific information and instructions for the team.

# The Staff is Untrainable!

Imagine this familiar scenario: you have done your best to onboard your new team and to provide them with all of the resources that you feel are necessary for them to be successful in their positions. While it seems like they understand your goals and expectations, they are not performing up to your standards. It's as if all of your efforts have yielded no results.

When this occurs, it's a good time to reflect upon the root cause of the disconnect: Maybe these team members would respond more favorably if the information was presented in a different manner or via a different modality? Perhaps they need more support or accountability measures in place? Maybe you need to modify your leadership style or delivery?

In a Continuing Education video we have done on DSN about Managing Change; we discuss the large 6 points about the process to change. Remember; to affect change, we need to have:

1. Awareness
2. Buy-In
3. Skills
4. Desire
5. Action Plan
6. Resources

So, before coming to a definitive conclusion about the value or capability of a team member; sometimes it's helpful to assess whether you have been clear about expectations, have supported him or her in every way possible, and have allowed sufficient time to adjust to the change in ownership. We have found that some of our most talented, valuable, and trusted employees have had a shaky start, and giving up on them too soon would have been a hasty decision.

On the other hand, if you believe that you have done everything in your power to get them trained and they still fail to fit the culture or meet your skill-set standards, it may be time to free them to a new future.

# 1. You Get Stuck with Unforeseen Expenses

Every acquisition that we've ever been involved with has resulted in unforeseen expenses. A sterilizer breaks. A server goes down two weeks after the warranty expires. The AC unit only blows hot air. The chair in room one won't recline. These types of "emergencies" can throw a serious wrench in your day, week or month, but are just part of what we are taking on with business ownership.

We believe that even though these types of expenses can sting for a new owner; especially if they occur in clusters and in a relatively short time from closing; that it pays off to fix them the right way: Planning for contingencies is paramount to a successful transition. In order to account for these unpredictable occurrences, it's helpful to have a line of credit available to deploy as needed and avoid costly shut-downs.

# 2. Accounts Receivable are Not Being Received

Oftentimes new owners struggle to collect AR that they have purchased from the selling doctor. Our best guess as to why this scenario occurs so often is that patients may feel as though they do not need to pay a new doctor for work done by the previous dentist and the fact that payments may be delayed from insurance companies during the credentialing process. If you find yourself in this scenario we recommend reviewing Chapter 4 as a refresher as to the most effective and efficient methods of collecting AR.

We often see after the fact that people have paid too much for AR. With this in mind, if you are considering buying the AR with the practice, factor in the cost of uncollectible monies from patients who refuse to pay the new owner. Also keep in mind the time value of money: Simply put; the longer it takes to get paid, the less the money is worth to you.

# 3. The Associate Doctor is your New Employee

When we inherit an associate dentist during a practice sale there are a myriad of considerations that have to be made. One of the trickiest scenarios that we've seen is when the associate doctor was not aware that a sale was taking place and was caught off guard.
---
This even more difficult is when the doctor was led to believe that they were going to be a partner or given the opportunity to buy the practice outright: When this occurs, and you wish to retain him or her as an associate, it's best to be completely transparent and begin anew: These scenarios can place you right in the middle of an emotionally charged situation, but keep in mind that this is now your practice, you did not make the decisions that led to their current experience. You also know that you will be fair and supportive in your new role as practice owner. Open conversations about contract details and compensation need to be had uncovering as many details as possible with the help of professional advisors and counsel.

There will be a delicate balance to this process and it will test your diplomacy and leadership style right out of the gate. Now is the time to define your expectations as clearly as possible, the level of systemization you intend to deploy, your culture and clinical philosophies and how he or she will fit into your long term plan for the practice.

# More Resources and Open Dental Startup Resources

# Other Resources

Inside the Dental Success Network, there is a room specifically meant for doctors who are starting and taking over a practice, "Starting up Right: Acquisition and Denovo Secrets." This is where you can either search for posts about a topic, or ask your own question to the faculty and members of that group: It is always good to have people in your corner and colleagues to turn to who have been there, and want to help and support you in your journey.

Also as you traverse this journey; rely on your own physical and mental health. We recommend using the 4 Futures Journal created by co-author Mark Costes and Alastair Macdonald, and edited by co-author Addison Killeen. This is the journal we use every day; and we think it might be of help to you as well: The framework is helpful because it has many pages set up perfectly for the endless to-do lists you will encounter!

# Patient Notes

This process will allow you to put patient notes on the Vic4 Appointment Screen without having a lake appointment: To start, click 'View Patient Appointments'

Then 'NOTE for Patient'

Then enter any note that needs to be remembered for the patient.

And remember that you can always set it to 'Completed' This is where you can write a note and it goes on the Appointment book: but it's not a TRUE appointment No reminders. Other than maybe a task associated with this patient until it goes into their chart scrolling log It will then turn the note dark grey

This is where you can write notes and it goes on the appointment book; it's not a TRUE appointment No reminders, other than maybe a task associated with this Patient.
