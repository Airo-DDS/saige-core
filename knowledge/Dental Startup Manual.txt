# THE ULTIMATE GUIDES TO DENTAL SUCCESS!

# DENTAL OFFICE OPERATIONS MANUAL

The resources found in The Dental Office Operations Manual are the ultimate guide to creating your own in-office operations manual. We know how important it is to take time to create internal resources with a high level of detail. This level of detail will guide your team, organize your office and help to create that stress-free practice you're striving for:

# THE ASSOCIATE MANUAL

Many dentists are getting to the point of burnout because their practice is growing and patients love their personalized care. However, at a certain point, they cannot do any more dentistry. When this problem occurs, the most common answer is to grow the business and hire an associate. Unfortunately, most dentists do not plan or execute this idea well at all. This leaves the owner frustrated and the associate in a bad spot after a few months. This book is the answer to help avoid those problems, keep the owner of the practice happy, and give systems to help develop the associate into an amazing clinician and member of the team:

# DENTAL OFFICE ACQUISITION MANUAL

This 339-page instructional manual covers everything you could need in buying a dental practice. From scouting locations for possible acquisitions all the way through the challenges that may arise as you take ownership and work with a new team: This is the book we wished we had as we ran the gamut of acquiring offices.

# How to Use The Dental Startup Manual

Thank you for purchasing The Dental Startup Manual! This book is a compilation of many of the top resources we have to help dentists as they traverse their startup journey: We wrote this book to boil down some of the information we have learned over the course of owning and managing 25 dental clinics (at the time of this writing).

We have not always had it 'figured out'. We have made many mistakes. Some have cost us hundreds of dollars, some have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, through these experiences and in coaching more than a thousand dentists over the past 10 years, we have learned the best and most economical way to execute a startup clinic.

This book is just part of our plan to help dentists. As Co-Founders of the Dental Success Network, our entire goal is to help make the lives of dentists easier. That is what we do every day: Inside the Dental Success Network; our goal is to make dentists' lives better with three main points: saving them money; teaching them new skills, and connecting them with colleagues in a positive environment to learn collectively.

# Chapter 1

# Vision

When you think about the next stage of your dental career; are you looking for a fresh start, a new location; and a new dental home that you can own and call your own? Are you ready to leave a job that does not energize you? Have you been thinking that there is a long list of things that you would do if you owned your own shop?

That's why you have your heart set on a startup.

There is joy in creating a business from scratch, watching it grow, and finding success by birthing something from your own hands: There's a certain gravitas to the respect you earn when doing a startup. We get it, we have been there.

However, let's not fool ourselves into thinking a startup is easy: There's checklists that have hundreds of items, all to be completed at specific times. Add that list to the complexity of simultaneous checklists, and that will cause panic attacks for even the toughest minds.

As you go about the process of evaluating the startup, you will need to make a list of pros and cons. Here's our list:

Pros:Choosing your own locationChoose the aesthetic vibe of the officeHand picked staff from day onePractice the dentistry YOU want to practiceFinancial benefits of ownershipYou are the boss and have complete controlAbility to help staff grow and realize potentialClean slate
Cons:Security in choosing own futureMedium debt loadSlow revenue start
---
# Establishing a solid new patient flow from ground zero

# Creating all new systems from Scratch (BUT this book will help)

The graph to the right shows the example of Startup Revenues approximately how much debt you might encounter in a start up practice, and how the example revenues might be. While sometimes that much debt is scary; the positives of the situation can be much more important:

To achieve greater clarity on whether this debt load and situation is truly what you want; the next exercise is going to be extremely important:

# Ideal Practice Exercise

Most sports psychologists will have an athlete picture themselves winning before a game. The athlete will picture getting the ball with 2 seconds left and shooting the game-winning shot. They will picture sprinting and leaning forward to break the tape first. They will picture throwing a pass to score a touchdown as time expires.

With that same mindset; we will now go through the following exercise. Go through the following questions to envision the ideal practice in your future.

For some answers, you may not have a good idea of where you should be, and that is absolutely fine. Not everyone understands what is possible, and not everyone knows exactly where they want to be in 10, 20, or 30 years.

# Step 1

Start by writing down answers to all the following questions:

- Where do you want to live:
- What type of patients do you serve (Fee for Service, PPO, Medicaid, etc):
- How many practices are in your perfect business:
- What's the size of the facility of the business in square feet:
---
# How many operatories:

# How is it decorated:

# What 'feel' does the office exude when you walk in:

# What brands or stores does your dental practice mimic or remind your guests of:

# What colors and materials will be the main look of the practice:

# How is it unique from the competition:

# How many dental (dentist) associates (if any):

# How many people are on your team:

# What is the annual production and collections:

# What is your personal production per month:

# What is the overhead and profitability percentage:

# How many clinical hours do you work per week:

# How many CEO hours do you work per week:

# How many weeks do you take off per year:

# What is your personal take home income:

# Does your practice bring you peace of mind, fulfillment; freedom and joy:

# How old are you when you sell the practice and retire:

# How will you spend your days during retirement:

# The purpose of owning my practice is to:

# My business will allow me to:

# Will build this practice so that can:

# This practice will give me the ability to:

# What skills will need to improve on:

# What habits do need to remove from my life:

# Lastly; What type of owner/dentist/leader do need to become to achieve the goals set forth above?

# Step 2

Take the answers to these questions and write out your manifesto in paragraph form.

Example: On June 14, 2034, at the age of 60 years old, will transition out of my dental business by selling my group of practices to four dentists who were previously associates and later became minority partners. When the business sells, it will have a total of three affiliated dental practices producing $7M with no debt. The EBITDA will be 20% and the practice group received a 6X valuation. The sales price will be $8.4M. As an 80% owner of the entire group, will receive a pre-tax check of $6.72M.
---
# Included in your Manifesto

- Your Age when "It's Done" and you're ready to transition
- The transaction value of the business and your take home pre-tax
- Exactly what the practice looks like: physical size, decor; location, team, to the type of services rendered, purchaser.
- Your overall health, your relationships, your mental health (4 Futures Score)
- Plan for what to do with your days
- What's your next chapter?

# Step 3

Create benchmarks with exact dates and specifics that lead to the eventual end goal.

- Age 30
- Age 40
- Age 50

# Step 4

Review your Manifesto, Benchmarks and Timelines each month from now until your ultimate deadline.

# Creating Your Ideal Office

Once you have set your vision in larger terms, the next step is getting down to the physical aspects of the office that will set you apart from other dentists in your area. In this domain, the next steps are to focus on the 5 senses, and see where they lead you in terms of the 'feeling' that a patient would get when they enter and get treatment in your office.

With each of these senses, we need to focus on the details of each:

# Visuals

- Colors
- Cleanliness
- Materials
- Designs (shapes)
- Accents
- Modern or classic

# Smell

- Clean
- Sense of warmth or clean or fancy
- 10 Basic Categories of smells: fragrant, fruity, woody/resinous, (non-citrus), chemical
---
mintylpeppermint; sweet; popcorn, lemon and two kinds of sickening odors: pungent and decayed

# Touch-

High quality in front- less fancy as you go further back in the office

# New vs. Old

Hard, soft, smooth, rough

# Hearing-

Noisy or congested

Music-Style/energy/volume

Sound engineered to cover for noise

# Taste (highly associated with smell)

Coffee stations or drinks

Prophy polish taste/varnish/aesthetics

Rinses (post appointment)

Facial Wipes

Many of the qualities you might dream of for your office listed above might make you think of your favorite brands or stores. When you compare stores that you like to some of the dental offices that you have been in, you might wonder; why aren't more dental offices like fine stores? As you dream about your new dental office.

# Find brands that you like/love

# What is it that makes them different from competitors?

# How do the stores feel? How do they make you feel?

# Brand- what sets them apart?

# How would you apply these values/standards to your practice?
---
# Example: Starbucks

dark wood, rich smells, lighting, sounds

# COFFEA ARABICA

At this stage in the process, the next step is to start to compile a powerpoint or slideshow of stores, places, smells, and images that you like. It can be of anything that moves you: Sometimes you can just start taking pictures of stores or places you like, and then compile all those when you are ready:

This PowerPoint presentation will then be the basis for an interior designer; architect, and marketing person to work together to make sure your startup has the right feel for your goals.

After you have this vision in place, the next step is to start looking at the financial picture of what it will take to get you to your final goals.

If everything you've done up until now is in alignment and still points you towards a startup, the next stage is to prepare documents and start talking to banks to discuss how their lending package will look for a dentist in your situation:

---
# Chapter 2

# Financials

The next stage in the startup process is to get all your financial paperwork together to make sure that a financial institution or bank will lend you the money it will take to do a startup. This process will make you extremely familiar with either Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. Access all of the documents below needed for this stage of the process with the QR link at the beginning of the book:

To begin, you'll need all these documents:

1. Personal Financial Statement
- Loan Calculator
2. Business Plan in written format
- Using many of the spreadsheets listed here
3. Construction Costs
4. Budget + Gameplan
5. Master Formulary
6. Supply Budget

All of these are important as you approach banks, but the last few will help you execute as you begin to make sure you stay on track towards your vision:

# Personal Financial Statement

First you will need to create an updated Personal Financial Statement (PFS): A PFS is really just a snapshot in time of the financial picture of you: It includes:

- Cash in banks
- Accounts Receivables that are to be paid to you
- Securities/stocks/bonds owned by you
- Any real estate you own
- Any vehicles or other assets you own
- Any insurances you own that have cash surrender value
- Any debts you owe in student loans
- Any real estate debt
---
Any vehicle or asset debt

Any accounts payable (bills that you have due)

Usually a bank will also want to know your occupation, place of employment; length of employment;, income, and your typical monthly living expenses. This will give them a pretty good idea of the risk profile that you have, and whether they feel you would pay back the money they lend to you:

Here is the example of the PFS that is provided in the document vault:

We really encourage people to update their PFS monthly or quarterly: Although it seems like a worthless endeavor; it will always keep you on track for your vision. It will also be needed for financial institutions many times throughout your life, so keeping it updated will ensure it's readily available in the future. In essence, it shows your real-time net worth.

There are few web applications that are very popular nowadays to keep track of everything automatically; but possibly the best one is Mint' by Intuit: This is the same company that created QuickBooks; and their web-based software can tie into any other bank software and mortgage schedule to keep you with an updated PFS in real-time.

# Loan Calculator

It might seem a bit backwards, but now that you have your PFS, you have probably already gone looking for all the loan paperwork for any real estate or vehicle loans you have. This spreadsheet is great for tracking all of your loans in one place.

# Loan Balances

|1|Get the paperwork for each loan you have for any business/personal entities|
|---|---|
|2|Start at Loan A|
|3|Place the Entity, Lendor; Loan Title, Term, Rate, and any other information|
|4|Make sure to put the monthly payments in the column as hard-coded|
|5|If the interest doesn't accrue correctly, you may have to type that amount in each month as well (Some banks do daily interest- which is hard to replicate)|
|6|Go through steps 2-5 for each loan|
|7|In Summary Cell L2- pick the matching correct number for the month|
|8|Zero out any unused sheets|
|9|Going forward, any month that you pay additional- put that added principal payment in the column on that loan|

# I. Instructions: Executive Summary

The Executive Summary is the most important part of your business plan. Often, it's the only part that a prospective investor or lender reads before deciding whether or not to read the rest of your plan. It should convey your enthusiasm for your business idea and get readers excited about it; too.

Write your Executive Summary LAST, after you have completed the rest of the business plan: That way; you'll have thought through all the elements of your startup and be prepared to summarize them:

The Executive Summary should briefly explain each of the below:

1. An overview of your business idea (one or two sentences):
2. A description of your product and/or service. What problems are you solving for your target patients?
3. Your goals for the business. Where do you expect the business to be in one year, three years, five years?
4. Your proposed target market: Who are your ideal patients?
5. Your competition and what differentiates your business: Who are you up against; and what unique selling proposition will help you succeed? Describe the competitive landscape around your area.
6. Your experience in the dental field, or your consultants that you're hiring to help. What do you already know about the dental field that will help you succeed? What do your consultants bring to the table that will give your business a competitive edge?
7. Financial outlook for the business. If you're using the business plan for financing purposes, explain exactly how much money you want; how you will use it, and how that will make your business more profitable. Use the Pro Forma Spreadsheet to help you in this process.

Limit your Executive Summary to one or two pages in total.

After reading the Executive Summary, readers should have a basic understanding of your business, should be excited about its potential, and should be interested enough to read further. After you've completed your business plan, come back to this section to write your executive summary on a full page:

# Instructions: Company Description

This section explains the basic elements of your business. Include each of the below:

1. # Practice mission statement

A mission statement is a brief explanation of your company's reason for being: It can be as short as a marketing tagline or more involved. In general, it's best to keep your mission statement to one or two sentences.
2. # Vision

1. a Where do you see the company in 1, 3, and 10 years?
2. b What will it look like? How many employees? Use the vision statement from the last exercise to help write this section.
3. # Core Values

a What are the company Core Values that will guide you in making many of your decisions?
4. # Demographics of your Ideal Patient

You will cover this in-depth in the Marketing Plan section: Here, briefly explain who your target customers are.
5. # Dental Industry

Describe your industry and what makes your business competitive: Is the industry growing; mature or stable? What is the industry outlook long-term and short-term? How will your business take advantage of projected industry changes and trends? What might happen to competitors and how will your business successfully compete?
6. # Legal structure

1. a Is your business a sole proprietorship, LLC, partnership or corporation? Why did you choose this particular form of business?
2. b If there is more than one owner; explain how ownership is divided. If you have investors, explain the percentage of shares they own. This information is important to investors and lenders.

After reading the Company Description, the reader should have a basic understanding of your business's mission and vision, goals, target market, competitive landscape and legal structure.
---
# III. Instructions: Products & Services

This section expands on the basic information about your products and services included in the Executive Summary and Company Description. Here are some items to consider:

1. Your practice's products and/or services: What kind of dentistry will you be doing? Will you see patients of all ages? Do you prefer to focus on a specific type of patient? Will you be having hygienists as part of the team, or prefer more of a doctor/surgery-centric model?
2. Any features that give you a competitive advantage: Do you have exclusive agreements with suppliers or vendors to sell a product or service that none of your competitors sell? Do you have a skillset that other dentists in the area do not have? Do you have an in-house lab to fabricate special prosthetics? Do you print 3-D aligners? Do you place implants? Do you fabricate sleep apnea devices?
3. How you will price your product or service: How does your product or service fit into the competitive landscape in terms of pricing - are you on the low end, mid-range or high end? How do you plan to set prices? What percentile will you place your fees? Will you choose to hover towards the 60th percentile of fees in your area, or go more for the typical 80th or 90th percentile in fees? Will you try to attract more Fee-for-Service patients or go In-Network with PPOs and Insurance companies?

Does your pricing strategy reflect your positioning and vision? Compare your prices with your competitors'. Are they higher, lower or the same? Why?

Do your competitors offer any specials that you will match or differ from? How important is price to your customers? It may not be a deciding factor: What will your customer service and credit policies be?

What Payment Plans will you offer? Any Day-of Discounts?
---
# IV: Instructions: Marketing Plan

This section provides details on your industry, the competitive landscape, your target market and how you will market your business to those customers:

# 1. Market research

There are two kinds of research: primary and secondary. Primary market research is information you gather yourself. This could include going online or driving around town to identify competitors; interviewing or surveying people who fit the profile of your target customers; or doing traffic counts at a retail location you're considering.

Secondary market research is information from sources such as trade organizations and journals, magazines and newspapers, census data and demographic profiles. You can find this information online, at libraries, from chambers of commerce, from vendors who sell to your industry or from government agencies.

This section of your plan should explain:

- The total size of your market
- Trends in the market: is it growing or shrinking? New housing going around you?

# 2. Barriers to entry

What barriers to entry does your startup face, and how do you plan to overcome them? Barriers to entry might include:

- High startup costs
- High marketing costs
- Brand recognition challenges
- Finding qualified employees
- Need for specialized technology or patents

# 3. Target customer

Describe your target customer: (This is also known as the ideal customer or patient avatar:) You may have more than one target customer group. For instance; if you sell a product to consumers through distributors, such as retailers, you have at least two kinds of target customers: the distributors (businesses) and the end users (consumers):

Identify your target customer groups, and create a demographic profile for each group that includes:
---
# For consumers:

- Age
- Gender
- Location
- Income
- Occupation
- Education level

# 4. Key competitors

One of the biggest mistakes you can make in a business plan is to claim you have "no competition." Every business has competitors. Your plan must show that you've identified yours and understand how to differentiate your business. This section should:

- List key companies that compete with you (including names and locations), products that compete with yours and/or services that compete with yours.
- Do they compete across the board, or just for specific products, for certain customers or in certain geographic areas?
- Also include indirect competitors. For instance, if you're opening a restaurant that relies on consumers' discretionary spending; then bars and nightclubs are indirect competitors.

Competitor Data, Locations, and Type of Dental Practice

Use the area here to describe your competitors, but also use the chart on the next page to put into more details the areas where you differ from your competitors.
---
# Competitive Analysis Worksheet

For each factor listed in the first column, assess whether you think its a strength or a weakness (S or W) for your business and for your competitors. Then rank how important each factor is to your target customer on a scale of 1 to 5 (1= very important; 5= not very important). Use this information to explain your competitive advantages and disadvantages.

|FACTOR|Me|Competitor A|Competitor B|Competitor C|Importance to Customer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Type of Dentistry| | | | | |
|Price| | | | | |
|Quality| | | | | |
|Hours| | | | | |
|Google Reviews| | | | | |
|Stability of Doctors| | | | | |

|Location| | | | | |
|Appearance| | | | | |
|Sales Method| | | | | |
|Credit Policies| | | | | |
|Advertising| | | | | |

# 5. Positioning/Niche

Now that you have assessed your industry, product/service, customers and competition, you should have a clear understanding of your business's niche (your unique segment of the market) as well as your positioning (how you want to present your company to customers): Explain these in a short paragraph.

# 6. How you will market your product/service

In this section, explain the marketing and advertising tactics you plan to use.

Advertising may include:

- Online
- Print
- Radio
- Cable television
- Out-of-home

Which media will you advertise in, why and how often?

Marketing may include:

- Business website
- Social media marketing
- Email marketing
- Mobile marketing
- Search engine optimization
- Content marketing
- Print marketing materials (brochures, flyers, business cards)
- Public relations
- Trade shows
- Networking
- Word-of-mouth
- Referrals

What image do you want to project for your business brand?

What design elements will you use to market your business? (This includes your logo, signage and interior design) Explain how they'll support your brand.

# 7. Promotional budget

How much do you plan to spend on the marketing and advertising outreach above:

- Before startup (These numbers will go into your startup budget)
- On an ongoing basis (These numbers will go into your operating plan budget)
---
# 8  Location or proposed location

If you have a location picked out; explain why you believe this is a good location for your startup.

If you haven't chosen a location yet; explain what you'll be looking for in a location and why; including:

- Convenient location for customers
- Adequate parking for employees and customers
- Proximity to public transportation or major roads
- Type of space (industrial, retail, etc.)
- Types of businesses nearby

Focus on the location of your building, not the physical building itself. You'll discuss that later; in the Operations section.

# VI. Instructions: Management & Organization

This section should give readers an understanding of the people behind your business, their roles and responsibilities, and their prior experience. If you're using your business plan to get financing; know that investors and lenders carefully assess whether you have a qualified background in the dental industry that warrants lending:

1. Biographies
Include brief biographies of you and any key employees. Include resumes in the Appendix. Here, summarize your experience and those of your key employees in a few paragraphs per person. Focus on the prior experience and skills that have prepared your team to succeed in this business. If anyone has previous experience starting and growing a business, explain this in detail.
2. Gaps
Explain how you plan to fill in any gaps in clinical time.
3. Advisors
List the members of your professional advisory support team, including:

- a Attorney
- b Accountant
- c Board of directors
- d Advisory board
- e Insurance agent
- f Consultants
- g Banker
- h Mentors and other advisors
---
# VII. Instructions: Startup Expenses & Capitalization

In this section, detail the expenses involved in opening for business and how much you'll capital need: (Do not include ongoing expenses after your business opens; those are listed in the Financial Plan:) Estimating startup expenses as accurately as possible helps you gather enough startup capital:

# 1. Start-Up Expenses & Construction Budget

Download and complete the Construction and Equipment Worksheets. In working on this Business Plan, you should already have gathered most, if not all, of the information you need: In the body of this section, be sure to explain all of the assumptions behind the figures: How did you come up with these expenses? If you've secured or expect to secure loans, explain the source(s), amount(s) and terms. If you've secured or expect to secure investors, explain how much each investor will contribute and what percentage of ownership each receives in return:

Be sure to include extra capital for unexpected expenses. Opening a new business almost always ends up costing more than expected, and you need to be prepared: We have been calling this the Line of Credit and is the amount of money you will have to spend more than your initial budget to just get the business started: Use the Pro Forma to estimate these costs.

# 2. Personal Financial Statement

If you are using the business plan to seek financing, include personal financial statements for each owner and each major stockholder: The personal financial statements should detail each person's assets and liabilities outside of the business and their personal net worth. Investors and/or lenders typically expect business owners to use personal assets to finance a startup, and they'll want to see how much capital you have available from your personal finances.

# 3. Pro Forma

Create two forecasts (or Pro Forma Spreadsheets): a 'best guess' scenario (what you really expect) and a 'worst case scenario (one you're confident you can reach no matter what).

Keep notes on the research and assumptions that go into developing these sales forecasts. Financing sources will want to know what you based the numbers on:
---
# IX. Instructions: Appendices

After reading the Startup Expenses & Capitalization section, the reader should know how much money is needed to start the business and how well capitalized you are.

Don't slow your readers down by cluttering your business plan with supporting documents, such as contracts or licenses. Instead, put these documents in the Appendices, and refer to them in the body of the plan so readers can find them if needed.

Below are some elements many business owners include in their Appendices:

1. Agreements (Leases, contracts, purchase orders, letters of intent; etc.)
2. Intellectual property (trademarks, licenses, patents, etc.)
3. Resumes of owners/key employees
4. Advertising/marketing materials
5. Public relations/publicity
6. Blueprints/plans
7. List of equipment
8. Market research studies
9. List of assets that can be used as collateral

You can also include any other materials that will give readers a fuller picture of your business or support the projections and assumptions you make in your plan. For instance, you might want to include photos of your proposed location, illustrations or photos of a product you are patenting, or charts showing the projected growth of your market.

After reviewing the Appendices, the reader should feel satisfied that the assumptions throughout the plan are backed up by documentation and evidence.

# Instructions: Refining the Plan

Modify your business plan for your specific needs, audience and industry: Here are some guidelines to help:

# For Raising Capital from Bankers

Bankers want to know that you'll be able to repay the loan: If the business plan is for bankers or other lenders, include:

- How much money you're seeking
- How you'll use the money
- How that will make your business stronger
- Requested repayment terms (number of years to repay)
- Any collateral you have and a list of all existing liens against your collateral
---
# Pro Forma Spreadsheet

One of the most important spreadsheets to include in your written business plan is the Pro Forma. While bankers and financing institutions will want to see it, it's also a worksheet for you to really iron out that this project is financially feasible. After going through the exercise, you will get to see exactly how much money you will need from the bank in the form of 'working capital'. (Working capital is a short-term loan from the bank that covers operational expenses for the first few months and then is paid back quickly because it is usually at a higher interest rate. Sometimes working capital is also called a line of credit.) The Pro Forma is also extremely useful to plot out how much you think you'll want to spend in different departments in order to hit the growth goals you have set out for yourself.

Download the document; and then follow these steps. The mock sheet has you starting your practice in July:

1. Along the top, put in the months in text boxes.
2. Start to put in how much revenue you will plan on receiving each month: This is not 'production', it is only collections: Keep in mind that collections always trails production by at least 30-60 days, especially at the beginning of your startup. This is typically due to insurance negotiations ongoing, payment plans, and the slower flow of patients.
3. Put in all cost categories and their expected monthly cost
- a. Some are based on a percentage of revenues like supplies or lab costs. Simply put; these are the variable expenses:
- b. Some are more stable costs like rent, utilities, or insurance. These are considered the fixed costs and do not change with increases in revenues.
4. The staff payroll line is calculated off of the second tab, and is a computed number based on the hours of an employee each month, as well as their pay rate. Put in each employee's start date, pay rate, and expected hours.
5. At the bottom of the sheet, you will see that the costs start to add up and then culminate into the 'EBITDA' line. This is your overall profitability line. At first, this line will be negative. However, after about 6-9 months, this line will become positive and you will start to make money. The line below the EBITDA line is then the Net Negative financial number: This is how 'low' your bank account will go during the first phase of your startup: This is also the number you should tell your bank to prepare in a working capital loan.

# Keys to the Pro Forma:

- Always overestimate expenses and underestimate revenues
- Always tell the bank a higher working capital loan

# Startup Budget Manager

As you go through the process of a startup, your mind will always go to the financials and the costs. Of course there are some pretty large numbers. There's also silos of equipment; technology, construction and other things that keep the hamster wheel going in your mind almost all day and night: As you start to think, download the 'Startup Budget Manager' to keep your thoughts straight, and to help keep costs in line as you go throughout the process. In general, the costs are split into a few major categories:

1. Summary Page
2. Construction
3. Equipment
4. Technology
5. Marketing

The Summary Page is shown to the right; and includes a quick overview of the major categories, their budgeted costs, amount spent; and remaining budget: It also includes a line of credit to plan for:

|Equipment|Budget|Spent|Remaining|
|---|---|---|---|
|Tech|$4,999|$0.00|$4,999|
|Construction|$39,767|$5,923.61|$33,843|
|Marketing|$38,000|$5,923.61|$32,076|
|Line of Credit|So|So|So|
|TOTAL|$282,266|$197,346|$84,920|

After having done the Pro Forma spreadsheet; you will have a good idea exactly what dollar amount in line of credit; or working capital, you will need: Put that number into this cell, and the total underneath that column will be the total financial package you will ask the bank for:

The first area you'll want to figure out costs is the construction: In this area, you'll want to put the size of the space in sq. ft: (Or if it's rectangular just put in the dimensions:) Most construction companies will give approximate costs per square foot; and so putting in the square footage first helps start to identify approximate costs.

# Buildout/Construction Costs

| | |Budgeted or Planned|Actual| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Size of Space|28.5| | | | | | |
|Per Sq. Ft| |70| | | | | |
|Total Sq. Ft| | | |Actually Spent| | | |
| |Planned Costs|$199,500.00| | | | | |
|General Contractors|Finish & Furniture| | | | | | |
| | | | | |Architect|Insurance Policy| |
| | | | | | |Loan Advances|Other Improvement|
|Demolition|$0.00|$0.00|$29.25| | | | |
|Design|$5.00|$9,975.00|$42.37| | | | |
|Construction|$105.00|$209,475.00|$216,511.22| | | | |
|Contingency|$15.00|$29,925.00|$0.00| | | | |
|Signage|$5.00|$9,975.00|$0.00| | | | |
|Tenant Allocation|$30.00|$52.02|$216,832.84| | | | |

We have split out the costs into demolition, design, construction, contingency, and signage. One area that might be confusing is contingency: This is usually considered the 'budget' factor; where we don't know what will go wrong, but we expect that something will cost more than expected: We will either forget something or the construction will go over budget in some areas. To help plan for this, add in another 10-15% of the project costs to make sure you have enough budget for any problems that may come. The last normal category is signage. Although signage would sometimes be put into marketing, it's usually a major expensive cost and you should have an area where it should reside.

Areas on the left side are where you can put rough budget numbers, and then all the areas on the right are where you can put expenses: As you go through the process, you can then keep on budget as you track costs. In the last right column; you also have a space for Tenant Improvement; or TI. TI is the money that some landlords will give you in order to help you complete construction. Keep in mind that this isn't always the case, but there is a chance that you can get some tenant improvement dollars from the landlord:

On the equipment page, it has a few of the major categories of equipment that you will need to remember to purchase. In it, it also has two major columns; where you can put the name of potential purchases, the brand, and the cost: Option 1 and Option 2 is a way for you to organize your thoughts, because very often during the process you will come across an equipment solution that could go two very different ways. For example, do you go wet vacuum or dry vacuum? Or; will you choose to use a Statim Autoclave or an M11 Ultraclave? These are not checking prices on the same piece of equipment, it is truly two very different options with different consequences to purchase.

The next column asks how many of each piece of equipment you will need, and then you get to choose the option of either #1 or #2, and that drop-down menu then helps select the price and equipment that you will purchase. It will then add up all the costs of the equipment and allow you to know your exact equipment budget from the start.

If you need more equipment that is not listed on this page, put more sections at the bottom but make sure to increase that added 'Total Budget' number to include any extra categories or equipment.

Next up is the Technology page: Very similar to the equipment page, you get to pick out what equipment you need, the cost of the equipment; the number needed, and it will spit out the budget that you should plan for: It is very difficult to plan for all the costs you'll encounter; so just make sure to account for higher costs than expected, and then you'll always be safe in the budget area:

# Marketing

Marketing is the last piece of the financial puzzle that you will want to include in your startup loan package. Included in this plan are all the main things that some startups look at doing: Of course, this is a substantial amount of money; but if there is return-on-investment for these marketing costs, then you will do well: With different vendors and ideas you can change these budgeted numbers to be whatever you want with different vendors and ideas, and then you'll be able to track actual expenditures easily:

# Budget + Gameplan

Once you're up and running; the Pro Forma Spreadsheet no longer works to track real-time expenses: While the Pro Forma is great for setting out a plan in the future to get financing; you need a dynamic sheet to help in the operational aspects of your new business. That's why you created the Budget + Gameplan sheet. See it here:

In this sheet; it gives you a 12 month picture of your practice and all expenses. This sheet is organized in a similar fashion as the Pro Forma, but can also be changeable to the specific areas of your practice where you'll have expenses. There are 3 main tabs in this spreadsheet:

1. Gameplan
2. Actual
3. Comparison

The Gameplan is the 'Budget' - in layman's terms: It is the expected revenues and costs of the practice over the next 12 months. All the revenues fall down into the 'Total Income' column, and then all expenses are below: Each category of expenses is a computed total line for the category, and then it is all added up into the total net revenues at the bottom.

For setting up the Gameplan, we usually suggest that you do this in about November of the previous year: During this time, you should review all expenses of the practice, see where you're above normal percentages, see where you're doing well, and then plot out the next full year: through this exercise can take some effort, but then you can start to plot out where you should be for the next year: It helps to plan for both staffing levels, expected profit; and taxes as well.

When putting in the Gameplan numbers, remember that some columns are going to be variable expenses, and we suggest trying to tie those costs to a percentage basis of the revenues. For example, your goal might be to keep dental supplies at 4.5% of revenues. In this case, you should put 4.5% X Revenues for this cost category: However; some are fixed expenses, and in
---
this case you should put those as flat-line numbers across the sheet For example; rent will not change month-to-month, so you should put in the costs and you won't need to correlate this number with production at all.

The Actual tab is the costs that you will put through the year: It will start out empty and then you will add your costs each month as you go through the year: One thing to remember is that as you change anything on the 'Gameplan' tab, that you'll want to change it on the 'Actual' and 'Comparison' tabs as well in the exact same place.

So the final tab, and the place where this spreadsheet truly helps - is the 'Comparison' tab. On this page; it will show you the dynamic Month comparison, year to date comparison, and end of year comparison. The only box to be changed on this page is to do the pull-down menu picking which month you're at so far: After you pick that; it will decide which columns to add up on the other tabs, and then you can start to do an analysis on what is going well and what is not.

# Master Formulary

The best way to control dental supply costs is to keep a master formulary of supplies: This will be the top 400 items that you order on a semi-regular basis. All your composite, impression materials, stone, plastic pieces, personal protective equipment; and so on.

# ANESTHETICS

|SKU|Description|QUANTITY in PK|
|---|---|---|
|8053006|Accuject 27g Short Needles|100|
|8871416|Monoject 30g Short Needles|100|
|8871418|Monoject 30g X-Short Needles|100|
|8200360|Carbocaine 3% Plain|50|
|8050215|Citanest Forte 4% wlepi|50|
|9515510|Lidocaine HCL 2% wlepi|50|
|8053850|Polocaine 3% Plain|50|
|9533808|Protector Needle Sheaths|500|
|9515480|Septocaine Gold 4% 1:100|50|
|9515482|Septocaine Silver 4% 1:200|50|
|3414070|Sharps Container 1.Sqt| |
|9521621|Topex Topical Gel Cherry (Sultan)|1oz|
|9521658|Topex Topical Gel Strawberry (Sultan)|1oz|
| |Stabident|20/pk|

The first step in the process to create your own master formulary is to create the list of all the supplies that you will ever order: When we say all, we truly do mean all: This is going to seem like an insanely tall order; however it is vitally important in your startup to keep costs down: You will not want people ordering random supplies from different places. You know what you want; so set the ground rules from day one that these are the supplies you like.

After you have the supply list, then you will want to go through and find the best cost for each supply: In the past; I've had an assistant do this for me. Or else, you can do this by hand: Thankfully, there is also a way that you can do this using a software. Currently our favorite is called Dentira. It is a real-time calculated software that will help you keep supplies at the lowest cost possible.

# Cost Comparison

|4651205|$26.15|9515510|$27.16| |
|1500004|$47.51|8053850|$43.75| |

|3127938|$10.79|9521658|$58.13| |
| | |Stabident| |$44.95|

After you have the costs into the spreadsheet; if you choose to do it manually, you can then create orders as often as you want; and then you'll go to wherever you can purchase that supply the cheapest. You can then order from that warehouse/company, and keep your supply budget at the lowest possible amount.

# Supply Budget

The biggest cost overrun for most practices is supply budget: We have found that time and time again in small practices, and even groups that have revenues upwards of $8 Million a year: Sometimes it's just a percentage creep, where at one point the practice was spending only 4.5%, and then suddenly it's 6% or 7%. Spread out over lots of revenues and over time; this can eat away hundreds of thousands of dollars, stretching even to millions.

The best way to combat this is to track your supply spending in a detailed way: This spreadsheet will help. To start, you will want to put in your historical revenues into the first page shown below: In this example, it starts with April 2021 with $20,000. Then $50,000 in May and going forward. Basically your target supply spend should be anywhere between 4 and 5% of the last 3 months averaged revenues. So if you're always making $50,000 in revenues, then the average 4% times that number is $2,000 a month to spend on supplies.

|All Smiles Dentistry|Jan 2021|Feb 2021|Mar 2021|Apr 2021|May 2021|Jun 2021|Jul 2021|Aug 2021|Sep 2021|Oct 2021| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Revenues|520,000|850,000|350,000|550,000|850,000|550,000| | | | | | | |
|Percentage Target| | | |61,400|61,600|190|52,000|52,000| | | | | |
|Budget| | | |81,400| |52,000| | | | | | | |
|Actual Spend| | | |00%|00%|00%|00%|0 0026|00%|0 0092| | | |
|Actual| | | |0| | | | | | | | | |

Remember that in growth mode it is not a good idea to try to squeeze too much in savings, due to the risk that you could run out of materials and not be able to finish a procedure. Due to this fact you'll want to base your ordering off keeping a minimum quantity, while always keeping an eye on the budget: As you approach your predetermined budget limit, you'll want to start making the tougher decisions on where to cut costs.

# All Smiles Dental

|Date Order|Vendor|Supplies|Total Spent|
|---|---|---|---|
|April 2021|Details| |$518.32|
|4/2/21|Ultradent|desensitizing gel, microbrush tips|$135.06|
|4/6/21|Ebay|coupler/handpieces|$1,449.00|
|4/6/21|Darby|saliva ejectors small/medium gloves, chlorhexidine, 256|$383.26|

As you start tracking your orders, use the second tab in the spreadsheet: The top line of the spreadsheet will have you put your budget in large numbers. This is the number copied over from the first sheet: Then, in each line below that; you'll put what date you ordered, which vendor; the supplies you ordered, and the cost: As you're adding in each order; and receiving an invoice later; you'll want to verify that it was the exact cost; because there's often discrepancies: After each month ends, you'll then move all those cells downward, and add in enough space to put a new month in: Thereby you'll always keep all supplies on a running tab, and be able to verify that you received the order; and that you'll keep costs within the budget for each month.

# Site Selection

# Demographics

Once you are ready with a vision for your practice, and the financing is approved preliminarily, the next step is finding the actual location for the practice. While each stage of the startup process is critical to the future success of your business, this stage is quite possibly the most tenuous because of the wild differences we've seen in what things cost and how your location may affect your future success:

In the first and second chapters, you have already started to identify exactly what type of practice you will create. Below are a few of the points you will need to identify:

1. Will you be in network with insurances? Or will you maintain 'out of network' status?
2. What sort of procedures will you perform?
1. Fillings/simple extractions
2. Wisdom tooth extractions with sedation
3. Invisalign
4. Dentures
5. Traditional braces
6. Pediatrics - will this be a special focus
7. Implants
8. All on X dentures/prosthetics

From this data, you will then be able to identify the sort of patient that you're going for: If you're trending towards wisdom teeth extractions and traditional braces, then you will know that your ideal patient is probably younger and being near a high school is a better idea. If your ideal patient includes dentures or all-on-X prosthetics, then your ideal demographic might skew towards the higher end of the age spectrum.

While evaluating locations for a potential startup, you need to make sure that your ideal patient demographic is at the top of your mind when evaluating each site. Remember that sometimes a site will have great demographics from a national scale. However, if they don't match the...
---
demographic of the dentistry you want to do, then your practice will fail to become successful and it will be a tough few years to gain traction.

Once you have your ideal patient demographics, the next step is to start evaluating potential sites and areas in the city you want to live in. Remember that a dentist will generally pull a high density of patients from about a 1 to 3 mile radius range. That small circle around your future practice is where it is the most important to have good demographics. When running reports, we will also include the 5 mile range, but that radius is not quite as important:

There are a few different softwares that compile demographics data: To see all your options, go to the document vault and look for 'Demographics Data Resources' - it gives the most up to date options that are all free.

While those softwares all have positives, we think simplicity is important and so we are going to suggest you use ArcGIS for all your needs.

Since different data sets told us important facts about possible startup locations, we used to run a couple sets of software to help us decide traffic and demographics. Fortunately now, they have all been rolled into one software, ArcGIS. Below are the instructions to help you run demographics:

To start; go to ArcGIS (www.arcgis.com): On this website there are many 'apps' that include different subsets of information. Sign up for a free trial: Once you are logged in, choose the Business Analyst' app.

After you have accessed the Business Analyst' app, click 'Create New Project', give your project a name, then click the 'Create' button.

After a brief load, you are able to open your new project and will be taken to a map. To create your first site, type in an address in the search bar at the top-right to place a pin at that location:
---
From the menu above your new pin, click 'Create site' and define the boundaries you want to use for your analysis, e.g. mileage rings, drive time, or walk time. After clicking apply, you will see your site as well as the boundaries you just created.

Back

|Rings|Drive time|Walk time|
|---|---|---|
|Radius|miles| |
|1|Lawndale Dr|Ok|
|U| | |
|2|6| |
| |Bureau of Land Management Esri. HERE| |

Now that you have created your first site you are able to view reports, infographics, and comparisons for data within that area. You can select these options by clicking on 'Reports' on the toolbar at the top of the page. From the reports screen, click 'Run Reports' in the toolbar to view infographic or classic reports, or click 'Comparison Reports' to compare data from your selected site with data from the same ZIP code, county, state, country or even another created site.

Lets start by running a classic report: from the 'Reports' tab click 'Run Reports' and then 'Run Classic Reports'. Make sure that the site you just created is selected at the top; if not you can click 'Add Sites' to select it:

Select sites to report on. Add Sites Selected sites L1 / Clear all

Select reports to run: Infographics Clas 815 N College Rd, Twin Falls, Idaho, 1, 3, 5 miles

Name

Now you can choose any one or multiple reports to run from the list below by clicking the checkbox next to each one you want to run. Hover your cursor over the icon to view a summary of the reports contents and click the magnifying glass icon to see a sample version of that report:

- Esri reports
- 2010 Census Profile
- ACS Housing Summary
- ACS Key Population & Household Facts
---
You will see all of the reports you have selected in the box on the right: From there, you can choose whether you want to download each report as a PDF, an Excel file, or both:

|Twin Falls County, ID|526,783|555,708|571,865|

As an alternative to running classic reports, you may also choose to 'Run Infographics' which will display the same data in various interactive infographic formats. Lastly, you can choose 'Comparison Reports' to view comparisons of data such as population growth, average household income and more between your selected site and the same ZIP code, county, state, country, or another created site. Use the dropdown menu in the top-left to change which data you are comparing:

We get questions all the time about; "What are the best demographics for starting a dental practice?" and "What is the minimum population/dentist ratio to start a practice?" These questions are difficult to answer because there are so many variables at play: This could include What is the percentage of the population in that area that goes to the dentist? Do all the people in this zip code have money to spend on dental services? Are the other dentists in the area competing for the same patients you want? Are these other dentists going to be direct competitors?
---
All of these questions go to show that there is not one type of dentist; and not one type of patient: Different cities and areas of the country can have wildly different demographics. In these demographics, you can find successful startups and dentists. So, study the demographics and then see how they match up to other areas to find the best one for you:

# Traffic Numbers

While the demographic statistics can greatly impact the success of your practice, the next largest factor is visibility of your practice. Of course you can be in the middle of New York City with a million people in a 3 mile radius; but if no one can see your practice, it will be hard to be successful:

So the next most important factor is visibility and traffic numbers near your practice. We all know that major corporate dental chains prefer to have high visibility spots. They will pay anywhere between $35-45 Sq: Ft. for lease space each year; and then pay all insurances, taxes and utilities on top of that!

We need to take a similar approach and understand that visibility is key to the success of the startup. In our Expense Breakdown reporting and analysis, we always preach that facility and site costs should be under 9%, and advertising should be under 4.5%.

# Expense Breakdown

|Front/Back Office|585.767|Expense %|Industry Standard|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hygiene Salaries|576,187|16.07|12.167|
|Payroll Taxes & Fees|51,217|2u1*| |
|Fringe Benefits|80|0.007| |
|Total Payroll|517,171|27.967| |
|Land/Facility|530,400| | |
|Dental Supplies|542,041|6.717| |
|Associate Salaries|8|0.007| |
|Office Consolidation|511,382|48*| |
|Total Doctor Salaries|SiLiU|17.787|Jo.0r|
|Advertising|19,856|3.475| |
|Other Expenses|4,108|0.6698|0|
|Other Expenses|543,552|5.3675| |
|Insurance|564,115|101| |
|Legal & Accounting|532,026| | |
|Office Expenses|1,888|2.229| |
|Facility & Equipment|566,791|10.667| |
|Telecom/Internet|51862|0.467| |

However; we always take a holistic approach to the costs, and if we can spend a little more in facility costs to get a better-visibility spot; we just need to then remove those costs from the advertising section to balance out and come to the same end-point for profitability of the practice.

The software we use to do traffic analysis is called ArcGIS. This is a high-level software that typically costs quite a bit; but there is a trial account that you can sign up for and get 60 days free. I would suggest doing this when you are ready to start running reports since you don't want to have to start paying for these reports.

ArcGIS will give you the traffic counts in specific spots along your roadways at different points in time over the past few years. So you will only want to run these reports once you're narrowed down to a specific city or a part of the city:
---
Here's how to run these reports if you have just a generic email:

1. Visit Learn ArcGIS to create an account for a free 60 day trial
2. Sign up for an account; an email will be sent with your Username info and prompt to create a password
3. Once signed into the Learn ArcGIS website, click on the app icon that appears next to your name in the upper right hand corner

When your membership in Learn ArcGIS ends; content will be deleted and licenses revoked. More info: https://go-esti corLeamn-FAQ

With all the traffic reports, print and use them in your Business Plan to know exact traffic counts and to make sure you're going to get the visibility you want:

Now that you have the data for your patient demographics and where your patients are driving around in your city, you will want to evaluate the number of dentists and type of dentistry being done around your location.

It would be very simplistic to say that all dentists are doing the same work and in the same way: We all treat dentistry slightly different; we all have different marketing techniques, and we might be going for different demographics of patients.

To illustrate this point; we will use the restaurant business as an example. Applebees is called a 'Mid-market American-Style Restaurant' by the National Restaurant Association. When they do site research, they really only care about similar 'Mid-market American Style Restaurants'. If there is a Dairy Queen next door to a potential site, they really don't need to worry: Dairy Queen focuses on walk-up and drive through traffic. Dairy Queen's price point is $3-8 a plate, whereas Applebees is $9-23 a plate. So, whereas they both sell food, they have no competition between each other.

The same might be true for your new location: A dentist down the street that has been there for 30 years and is trapped in an older medical building might not be the competition that would affect your new startup.

To evaluate the competitive landscape, you will need to:

1. Evaluate your competition for your targeted demographic
2. Use Google Maps/My Maps
3. Create a new Dental Office Locations map
4. Add layer
5. Add in locations for other dentists
6. Get a visual representation of competition
7. Count and Add into your spreadsheet

Once you've located all the dentists within a 5 mile range of your new possible location. You will now want to categorize these patients into groups. Create three different subsets of dental practices:

1. Dentists like you
2. Dentists who do not compete with you
3. DSO Corporate

Remember to evaluate along these competitive points:
---
# PPO's vs FFS

# What are their marketing styles?

# What are their hours?

# Do they have a decent website?

# Do they offer similar services as you will

Remember: your only competition are those dentists in your 'group'

It is also important to consider future demographics into the picture of how good a site is. While the current demographics might be very good, the future demographics might be so good you'll want to retain the option to build more square footage than originally planned.

To look at future numbers, check with your local planning commission or municipality about plans for future roadways, zoning, or new subdivisions. Here's a few key points to ask about:

- Will future construction be zoned commercial or residential?
- Even with commercial construction, will it be for 'Big Box' construction like a Wal-mart or smaller commercial strip malls?
- Will there be any major roadway construction that will block visibility or access to my site?
- Will there be any major roadway construction in the next few years that will restrict; even temporarily; access to my site?
- Are there any tax credits available to build in certain areas?

# Finding Properties and Planning

These days there are two major places to check for commercial real estate. Our favorite is LoopNet.com: It is the largest national website where most commercial properties are placed for sale. You can always sign up for a free or trial account, and it maintains the widest selection of leases and properties for sale anywhere.

If you are thinking of doing a ground-up build, there are a few key items to consider. These items will also be brought up by any real estate agent that is working on your behalf; but it's also a good thing for you to know: Here's a few main points:

- What zoning is dentistry in your city/municipality?
- Are there setbacks? (non-buildable sq. ft on the lot)
- - Utility Easement or normal non-buildable setbacks
- Is parking allowed on setbacks?

How is the site access? Is there a curb-cut allowed? Median blocking egress?
- Is it in a floodplain?
- What are the parking requirements per sq. ft legally? For dental and/or zoning requirements?

Remember that when looking at lots, an average of 10-25% of a lot is building and the rest is greenspace or parking.
---
Sometimes there just isn't any good land available, or you want to capitalize on an existing building lease to get into a space faster: When looking at leases, remember these key points:

- NNN means 'Triple Net' - and that means that the tenant pays all taxes, insurance and maintenance
- Replacement is usually on the landlord but not always
- Do you have exclusivity on dental in the development?
- What is the inflator? (How much does rent go up each year?)
- What is the traffic number on the streets in front of the practice?
- What cost will you put into the space over the next 10-20 years that you would be better off putting towards your own building? Do you have the financial freedom for that?

In either of the cases above, remember that start-to-finish takes a lot longer than you would normally expect. A startup in a lease space can sometimes take 9 months before opening, and a ground-up build can sometimes take 18-24 months before opening: Of course, there are many factors that can create changes in those times, but always count on construction taking longer than expected:

# Chapter 4

# Floorplan

As you continue your journey to building your dream startup, the next step is to start thinking about your floor plan: The floorplan is extremely important and gives character to the practice. One thing to remember throughout this process is that while we look at floorplans from the top-down; we walk through them in 3-D space. Sometimes that fact is lost on architects who design very neat looking buildings with rounded walls, angled hallways, or other fancy interior wall designs. However; when it comes to actually constructing the space and working in it; the fancy walls are then more expensive to build, and those curved walls actually create wasted square feet which contribute to operational inefficiencies.

In general, when we categorize dental floorplans for most typical startups in the 4-10 operatory range, we throw them into either oblong shapes or square-ish shapes. In slang terms, we call this the hotdog approach, or the hamburger approach.

The 'hotdog' approach is typical for narrow leasehold improvement spaces that have a narrow storefront. Typically these will have a long central hallway, and then all the rooms come off the left or right sides of this main hallway: This is very space efficient; because hallway space is kept to a minimum:

The 'hamburger' approach is more typical for larger buildings or stand-alone buildings built from scratch: This design application usually has hallways that are in the shape of the letter "O". As there are two hallways in each axis. While it might seem wasteful to have two hallways in each axis, it is almost a necessity because these 'hamburger' designs usually have more operatories and this is the only way to maximize the use of the space.
---
Once you have the exterior rough dimensions of the space, the next step is to start to layout operatories in the space and play with the general diagram of the space. As you look to fit in operatories, there's a general mathematical formula of 330 square feet per operatory: Generally if you take your square footage divided by 330, you'll approximate number of operatories to try to fit into a space. It can vary widely of course, to as small as 270, and as large as 400 square feet per operatory: At 400 square feet per operatory; there will probably be a lot of wasted space and we would not encourage that. It will feel very open and spacious, but the economics of that space will be less than ideal: You'll spend a lot to build out the space but the revenue generation on fewer chairs will be less than ideal.

At 270 square feet per operatory; it can feel two very different ways depending on the situation. With 7 or more operatories, 270 is a good number of square feet per operatory because there are certain spaces in the office that are the same whether you have 4 or 24 operatories. This includes bathrooms, equipment closets, and laboratory/sterilization to a certain extent. In the cases where you are trying to fit 4 or 6 operatories with 270 square feet per operatory; the office will feel very tight for sure. In cases where your floor plan will move towards that lower number of square feet per operatory, then you will need to utilize high ceilings or other design-build aspects that will make the office feel larger than it truly is.

# Blocking Diagram

After finding the exact number of operatories that you want in your space, you will start to place operatories and other major areas of the office into the exterior shape of the space. This process is called the 'blocking diagram' and it will help you start to get an idea of how many operatories can fit into a space and in which direction: Generally, the blocking diagram puts a general size on the operatories, and then colors them green. Then, all patient-only areas are colored in yellow; and staff-only areas colored in light blue. Hallways are then colored in gray: Arrows are used to indicate doorways, and there can always be two, or even three, doors into a room:

It is important to remember that most operatories generally fall in the 11-13 feet from head to foot height, and 7.5-10 feet width from right to left: If you follow the philosophy of saving square feet; then we would suggest the ideal measurements would be 8.5 feet wide by 12 feet long: You can definitely go smaller for hygiene operatories, but this is a very comfortable size for a dental operatory:

In the operatories described above, these are generally pretty spacious, but only when the cabinetry is minimal. Typically this will include a cabinet behind the head of the patient; and there should not be any side cabinetry at this width: The cabinet behind the patient can include a computer spot; a nice counter-top, and then some cabinetry below for some small storage. The wall in between the upper and lower cabinetry can sometimes be used to mount the computer screen, but can also be used to mount an aluminum slat wall that can host any mixture of flexible shelving options:

Another option for if you choose to go with minimal cabinetry is carts. There are some dental-specific manufacturers that are very good for carts, however the price on these is sometimes $600-1,000 per cart, and so we tend to recommend cheaper carts off of the internet that are sometimes $99-149 in cost and have no drawers: The reason for choosing something without drawers is so that nothing can ever get left: We usually use clear containers on these carts and it works well.

Traffic flow is something that you will focus on with the blocking diagram: As you start to place rooms and spaces into the exterior shell of the office, you will start to see how the traffic flow of the office will go. Remember that each extra step that a team member has to walk in the office is another wasted few seconds and possibly a longer route to walk for any patients who are elderly: Try to minimize repetitive walking patterns, and minimize overall traffic in between working areas.

It is good to imagine the wheel and spoke approach: Imagine that sterilization and lab are at the center of the wheel, and the spokes are the foot traffic to each of the operatories. The floor plan shown next is a good example of proper flow and centrally located sterilization. The operatories sit concentrically around the sterilization in equal fashion. In this pattern, the foot traffic is equal to almost all the rooms: We have seen where the sterilization and laboratory is at the end of the hallway, and mostly this is problematic because there will be a constriction of foot traffic at the end of the hallway as too many team members are trying to go in and out of this room at once: The only time when we would say this could be a good idea is if you are planning on growing in.
---
the next few years: In that scenario, you could plan on having sterilization towards one end of your floor plan; so that after you build on another 4 to 6 operatories, it will be concentrically located for all operatories.

# Bathrooms

One of the next rooms to plan for is bathrooms: Bathrooms that are compatible with the Americans with Disabilities Act are generally 7 feet 6 inches wide by about 6 feet 7 inches tall. On architectural plans, you will see a large circle drawn in the bathrooms, and that shows if a person in a wheelchair were to turn around, there will be enough room: To get to this size of bathroom, it is also going to be necessary to not have a cabinet underneath the sink: The sink in most commercial bathrooms will be the type that is bolted to the wall and has nothing underneath except for the drain pipes.

# Hallways

Hallways are the next space that is generally planned out in the blocking diagram. Hallways can be sometimes as narrow as 3 feet 6 inches, or as wide as 5 feet. Any hallway that is around 4 feet or narrower will feel very constricted, however that is acceptable if the hallway is not very long in length. If the hallway is longer than 10 feet; it is recommended that it be 4 and a half feet wide, or possibly 5 feet wide.

# Lab Space and Sterilization

Lab space and sterilization is another area that will start cutting this space, we would not recommend getting carried away with space reduction in these areas. While we do not know what will happen or be available in the future, we suggest keeping some open space and power options for future CAD-CAM machines or 3-D printers. As you start working on your own blocking diagram, use the spreadsheet that is in the document vault to sketch out what you'd like. See the example here:

# How to hire an architect:

- Select one early on
- Interview at least 3 firms/people
- Get references from other dentists who have recently built; or other buildings you admire
- Ask firms to show projects that are similar to yours
- Request to see samples of the architects projects

# Questions for the architect

- What were the approximate total construction costs/architectural fee?
- How many other dental offices have you done recently (within 5 years)?
- Which other consultants or resources do you use on your decision making team?
- Which equipment contractors do you usually work with?
- Which cabinet makers do you work with?
- Can get references from previous dental clients?
- What is a typical timeline from other projects you've completed?
- What is your cost structure?
- Who will handle the contractor choice and change order?
- Tell me about your design philosophy. more cost conscious or artistic?
- Do you have in house interior designers?
- How do you gather information, establish priorities, and make decisions?
- What is your most common design mistake you've seen in a dental office?
- If a dentist wants to make crazy decisions about colors and design- where do you try to steer them and what is your tactic in doing so?
- What design elements do you find often go overlooked by the dentist or team?
- How involved should (the dentist) be in the process?
- Will you be handling the punch-list at the end of construction?

# How to hire a contractor:

- Select this person 2nd in the process
- Interview at least 3 firms/people
- Ask other dentists who have recently built or other buildings you admire
- Ask firms to show you projects that are similar to yours
- Make SURE the architect and contractor you select work well together

# Questions for the contractor

- Can see previous samples of your projects?
- What were the approximate total construction costs and contractor fee on those projects?
- Which other consultants or resources do you use on your decision making team?
- How many other dental offices have you done recently?
---
Do you usually do design-build with your subcontractors?

For subcontractors, do you use the same subs on each job or have them internally?

Can you call previous dental clients as references?

What are the typical timelines for projects you've completed?

What is your cost structure?

Bid, construction manager at risk or cost-plus?

Who will the project manager be on site most often?

What are the most common mistakes you've seen in a dental office?

How involved should (the dentist) be in the process?

Will you be handling the punch-list at the end of construction?

How long after a project is finished do you guarantee your work?

# How to select an equipment representative:

# DON'T

We joke about equipment representatives and salespeople, but we really don't think they're needed at an early stage of the project. Sometimes larger companies will offer 'free' floor plans and designs, but this is a very transparent way to help you build a clinic that will house all of their equipment: Typically all the dental chairs and operatory units in a clinic can be purchased for anywhere between $6,000-8,000 an operatory: The cabinetry then can also be purchased for about $1,000 an operatory: Avoiding the dental "tax", will save you many thousands on this process, and so probably avoiding the dental salespeople will be your best route early on.

After hiring an architect and possibly a contractor to help you go through the design process, the next important step that we suggest is to utilize the free software called 'Sketchup' to start designing the space in 3 dimensions to get a better feel for the space. Started by Google as a side-project over 15 years ago, it was split off and now looks like this:

SketchUp Products Plans & Pricing Industries Resources

Try SketchUp

Where great ideas get to work

Design delightfully: Collaborate clearly: Build better buildings.
---
Go to their website, start a trial account; and then download our play document called Dental Startup 30.skp. It is a .skp file which is a 3-D file and has a bunch of items started for your use. As you start to play around with Sketchup; you will find that it is very easy and simple. It is quite literally a poor-man's CAD option. Part of the .skp file you will have some blocking diagrams laid out with more colors. This can help you decide what your new office might look like. There's also other sample floor plans that have some rooms placed and walls drawn in for your help.

As you get your floor plan closer to completion, you will want to import a PDF file of your plan into the Sketchup Software. Then you'll want to go all-out in full detail on the plan: Raise the walls to the exact height, create cabinetry, and even put in your sterilizer and other equipment as needed. Then you can color the equipment with wood, stone, or other colors to start to see very closely how it will look when finished.
---
One of the biggest reasons to do this is to catch potential problems as you're building: you

By doing this in 3-D first; you can avoid costly mistakes, or even avoid just small things that will annoy you for the next 15 years.

Here's a few points to look at as you are evaluating the plans in Sketchup:

- Look at sight-lines: Do hallways and rooms have good views of things, or will you be looking at odd doors or other things when walking places?
- Do you have enough space to put equipment as needed in the lab, sterilization, employee break room?
- Where will noise travel from different areas of the practice?
- How will the cabinetry look in the rooms and with the doorways?
- Will doors hit in odd areas and block off other areas to make some spaces less-usable?
- What will the floor-types be in different areas? Plan for transitions.
- How will the rear cabinet unit look? It would be a good idea to check with favored team members (or future team members) for feedback on design at this point.
- How will the building look from the exterior? (if you have control over that)
- Will the siding and other accents make it look interesting?
- How is the roof-line set up? Will it be good for different times of the year with sunlight; snow, etc?
- How will the building be set on the lot?

Overall, the process of using Sketchup is very simple, and you can learn it in a couple of hours. Using the document vault; you will be able to get a great head start on the process. We hope that the software is as useful as we do, and that you can help avoid some of the common mistakes we've made in the past in our practices.

While we can put a lot into text and story-telling, there's some things that only pictures can tell:

Below; we've decided to show you some pictures of items in offices that give either hints of things to do, or items to avoid if at all possible.

# Things to take into consideration:

# TV Screens

We have loved having TVs in spaces where windows were not an option. We usually encourage putting a TV screen over the patient's head, as well as at the patient's foot. We connect both to the computer in the rear; however usually the overhead one is always on a different video/music setting. When the toe-TV is set to be a computer screen extension, always put a nice fancy screen background on it and then it looks very nice. When you need to explain any radiographs, then you can pull up the radiographs over from the computer in a matter of seconds.

# Ceilings

High ceilings always give an impression of a larger space. We encourage 9-11 foot ceilings in all operatories to give the impression of a larger square footage. Another strategy is to do extremely tall ceilings in the waiting room and hallways. In the picture shown here, the central hallway has lighted boxed accents, which drop down to 12 feet from a 14 foot ceiling:
---
# Design with wear and tear in mind

You never know when something will break; or when something will happen that requires some pretty hefty fixing. To prepare for that, always build in functionality that can allow you to fix something without having to tear into some drywall.

Sometimes that means the rear wall in the operatory can be fully removed with just a few screws. Or, like in the example aside, the top of the door frame is actually just a 2 x 6 wooden beam, which can be easily removed by just a few screws to get to the metal tract.

Pay very special attention to the floor transitions and the baseboard. These quick turns, like the picture shows, can sometimes lead to baseboard popping off and looking very poor. In these scenarios, be very firm with the architect and contractor that you want these edges to meet up perfectly.

Baseboard is always good bumpers for carts/wheelchairs to keep from scuffing drywall. Be strategic in placement (making sure they meet up properly so you don't have to re-glue often).

# Take into account sunlight

Windows create natural light and warmth, but beware of western facing windows in the afternoon, and even East/South facing windows in almost any time of the day.

Install disposable frost adhesives in summer to block heat and light in unwanted places.
---
# Watch where people kick

When people come up to the checkout desk, make sure that the front-facing side of the desk is some harder material that will not show dents, dirt; or wear and tear:

Tile is one of the best because it's easily cleanable and almost destruction-resistant:

This is also a great place to show that the front desk should be very nice quality and high-end finishes: As you get further towards the back-office, you can go with cheaper materials: However; the front office should be the nicest stuff you can afford to put in.

# Create a nicer touch with tile on the wall of the patient bathroom.

This is about a $600-1000 cost; but can make the bathroom feel much nicer; and will give the high-end feel that you might be looking for: Plus, for cleansability, tile is much better for handling bleach chemicals than any drywall/paint or wallpaper:

# Use stick-on glass frosting to give the fancy appearance of etched glass at the cost of about $7 per window:

The image shown here is of the skyline of a town, and was purchased in sheet form for about $9. It was then cut out and applied to the glass. After 24 hours it is dry and can be rubbed against without any wear and tear on it:
---
Use glass or steel inserts to create the illusion of a wall, especially when low on space. This could be for the treatment coordinator's office, or for a separation between a sterilization area and some operatories.

Utilize wall inserts for gloves and paper towel dispensers as much as possible to minimize on wasted space in the operatories.

Install slat walls at the head of the operatory to mount computer and run wiring behind. Make sure you are aware/plan for where wires will need to come out for computers and outlets.

76
---
The floorplan phase is usually the most stressful because there are quite a large list of things to think about; but we generally have enjoyed this phase of the project in our new clinics. We hope that the blocking diagrams will help you start with a vision, and plan for flow: The flow is quite often the one most missed by architects because there are very few architects that understand the flow of a dental office and the operational efficiencies that can come from proper planning: We also hope that after you get some clarity with a blocking diagram, that you can use the 'How to Hire' questions to help find a high quality architect that will help turn that blocking diagram into walls and cabinetry: With all that put together; the Sketchup Program will be the best help you can in finding little things that might annoy you in the future. The easiest time to move walls and change cabinetry is while they still line on a computer screen, so take advantage of this time!

# Exterior Design and Roof

If you are doing ground-up construction, the first thing that any patient sees about you is the exterior of the building: In our experience we have hired architects who have taken this aspect of the process and tried to be fancy: We have seen costs skyrocket and the design elements of the project outweigh the usefulness and economies of construction. This sometimes has come in the form of fancy roof-lines, lots of bump outs, and fancy materials on the exterior of the building: While this looks very neat, sometimes it just doesn't work very well.

On the other hand, we have also had architects who built beautiful facades, but within a budget: For example, we have seen the exact same floor plans of buildings, built with different roof structures. The fancy roof structure was curved steel, skylights, and looked very modern: The second was a large sloping piece of wood with long wood beams that looked classy; with only one set of skylights at the end. The first steel roof cost $700,000 more than the wooden one due to customization!

# Key Rules for Evaluating the Exterior of a Building

- Curved and rounded walls are not a good idea: This will increase cost and windows that are on a curve are generally more prone to weather-related leakage.
- Flat roof lines look neat; but generally are more prone to leakage: Flat roofs can have all sorts of issues: Evaluate whether there might be any trees nearby which could mean that leaves get caught on the roof: Also look at the weather in your area and whether snow is a possible issue to have to deal with.
- The most economical roof type is a large sloped roof with peaks: This is the normal type of roof done on 90% of homes with asphalt shingles. Shingles do wear out; but for the cost of a few thousand, they will be replaced every 20-30 years.
- Smooth exterior walls are easier and cheaper to build: When looking at the exterior of the building, lots of random bump-in and bump-out areas do create for interesting visuals. However; this also creates a...
---
ton of extra cost because every time you have angles in the exterior wall, that also means more angles in the foundation, drywall, and any utilities. It also creates a lot of wasted space. Try to keep these aspects to a minimum:

# co ~dermotolooy

Use different materials to create interesting visuals. Just because an exterior wall is flat; does not mean you cannot use different materials on it to create the impression of change. The picture to the right shows a smooth wall, but the accented stone on it provides some eye-catching features: Of course, there is also a fake roof-line that extends off this flat wall, but that will not significantly increase costs versus actually changing the outside dimensions of the building.

While it can be enticing to want to build a fancy office with a beautiful exterior; look for ways to achieve the same goals without the cost. Also remember the usability and lifetime costs of the building: The more things you add into the building, the more the lifetime costs will increase as you maintain these things.

# Billing Coding and Insurance

For many of you, going in-network with insurance companies will be a necessary step to getting the new patient flow you want in the new office. Of course, there are times when a dentist can start and be only fee-for-service, but that is becoming rare in today's economy: With that, we will need to traverse a landscape that is both complicated and long: It is complicated due to the fact that many insurances 'rent' out fee schedules and can be put under the umbrella of other plans: This alone is confusing enough to make Oral Pathology look easy: However; when you compile the fact that many of these same insurance companies are not driven to offer timely service, you get irritation compounded over a long period of time. So how do we attack this problem? We will start at the beginning and walk you through, but always remember that outsourcing some of these things will most likely be the best use of your time.

# Negotiating and Credentialing with Insurance

If you choose to negotiate yourself, the timeline can sometimes be short to get to the negotiating point: (You can also hire a company like PPO Profits who will do that for you, as they are a favorite inside the Dental Success Network:) Typically this can be 4-8 weeks of back and forth. Ideally you'd have a list of the top codes you 'expect' to bill for: Now, as a startup you have zero history, but we would suggest looking at the codes that you are currently producing to find these top codes. Or else, if you are a new graduate, then we would prefer you just ask around for a list of the top codes and ask for that list:

The top 20 codes will be what insurances want to see when they start to negotiate with you. These codes may vary depending on the demographics of the area you're going to. More affluent areas might include more crown and bridge codes, whereas some areas might include more fillings and dentures.

After having these codes, you will want to also establish the Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) fee for these, as well as the fees for all your dental codes. To create this fee schedule and all fees, you will want to visit the website NDAS.com: On this website, they compile and sell the data from each zip code around the country: For less than $200, you can buy the data needed for you to set your fees according to the usual rates of dentists in your zip code:
---
After having some of this data in hand, you will want to pick the percentile of where you want your fees to be in relation to all other dentists in the area: The data includes where you could set your fees within the 5th Percentile all the way up to the 90th percentile. Typically; insurances will negotiate best if your fees are in the 80th percentile of all dentists in the area. This means that only 20% of dentists have any fees higher than you, but that 80% of all dentists in your zip code have lower fees: This will be beneficial for you as you negotiate because insurances will plug this into their system and usually give you higher expected reimbursement rates.

After setting your fees, you will want to call up an insurance company and ask for the 'Retention Specialist'. You, as the doctor, will want to establish a good relationship with this person, making sure to note their name, and any other aspects about your conversations with them. They have the power to make your negotiations easy or hard. Typically, we suggest using language that appeals to them like, "I would like to negotiate closer to the fees I'm requesting, because I really want to be able to help more of your patients out." However, if they're too low; "I don't know if I can do that." Trying to work with them will take time, but usually it does help if the doctor is actually the one talking and doing the negotiating.

Remember that fees can be re-negotiated every 18-24 months. This is a time-consuming process and so you'll be thankful that you only have to focus on it every 2 years. As you are starting to go in-network with insurances, try to only be negotiating with 3 to 4 at any given time. It is also important to remember that you don't need to negotiate ALL the codes. Many codes are things you'll never use. Don't worry about these codes: Focus only on those codes that you reasonably expect to complete with frequency, and forget about the codes that you will not be performing.

Most applications are straightforward and simple to fill out. The variables in credentialing are the reply times and how to add locations for a provider: Timelines can vary widely. It could take approximately 1-2 days to go in-network with one insurance because they handle everything digitally and internally themselves, not utilizing any 3rd party processor. In these cases, the provider relations representative will process your application and all of your credentialing requirements directly. It could also take months if they outsource the verification and only have approval meetings once every month to discuss applicants.

Adding locations for doctors that work at multiple practice locations differs by insurance companies. It is important to be aware that some insurance companies might require complete credentialing applications at each location, while some only require a 1-page "add location" form.

Keep your network status in mind when scheduling your first patients. Even if you are not in-network with that insurance company yet; you can always charge them as if you were an in-network provider and give the patient a discount. You can also hold claims until you do attain in-network status, as some insurances will retroactively date and credential you to pay.
---
in-network fees. These are important questions to ask for each insurance company representative at the beginning of each process:

1. Will my credentialing be retroactively dated to the date of application submission?
2. How long should expect for my application to process?
3. Are there any other accounts can set up in the meantime? (Web page for verification/tracking of application and electronic payment accounts)

Keep track of all of these insurance questions on a spreadsheet to know how you will treat patients as you start to see them.

# Deciding on Becoming In-Network Providers

There is a huge divide in dentistry currently between doctors who are espousing the benefits of staying out-of-network, and those who go 'in-network' with insurance companies. There are many differences in those models, but for start-ups, we recommend taking PPO insurances with in-network status. There are two strategies to execute when deciding which companies to go in-network with: First would be to see what insurers are the most used by large local employers. Second would be based on how well they pay versus your UCR fees:

# Find Large Employers

Start by narrowing down the list of top employers in your area and reach out to their HR departments for dental insurance information: Being a provider for the major employers in your area will help your practice grow more quickly: Employers will usually be inclined to give you their information, and might even include your information in their onboarding packet if you develop a good enough relationship: If an employer is large enough, it might even be advantageous to go in-network with this company even if the reimbursement rates are not as high as desired.

In some rural areas, you will have more leverage due to scarcity, or if you are a specialist: You can use this to your advantage and if you are one of the few providers, the employer might even be able to negotiate on your behalf to get you on board with their insurer. For example, if you are an oral surgeon, the employer can ask that you be contracted with as an out-of-network provider on their medical insurance side. This means that you will come up on the medical provider list but only for the approved list of services. By utilizing the gap in the market; you can serve patients that would normally have to drive hours to go see another provider: You also get to capitalize on out-of-network reimbursement rates, and if leveraged correctly; you could also help patients meet their medical deductible. In this case, you would still utilize the dental insurance as secondary to keep patients co-pays within a reasonable out-of-pocket expense.

To start a list of employers, think of local colleges, hospitals, large manufacturing facilities, and state and local government: Keep in mind that each insurance company usually has their own fee schedule for PPO providers, however that does not mean there aren't other options. They may also pay off other company fee schedules by renting fee schedules from other PPOs.
---
Keepin mind that you are allowed to talk to all of them and compile as many fee schedules as you want before signing any contracts. Reach out to these insurance companies and express interest in joining their network to request a fee schedule. Through different employers and plans, one PPO might actually have 5 or more fee schedules that pay from! They will automatically try to choose the lowest fee schedule if you are in-network with all 5 schedules, so make sure you know exactly which schedules you are signing up for: This is all part of the negotiation process, and this will be extremely important when entering fee schedules into your dental software.

# Payment Versus UCR and Cost

Some insurances will come back with great rates, but that's not always the case. When an insurance company comes back with rates that are close to your UCR, it will be easy to say that you will accept their offer and go in-network. However; remember that there are always clauses in the contracts that do limit some things. These clauses can sometimes be negotiated out of the contract with them. This includes the clause called 'Least Expensive Alternative Treatment', or LEAT clause. We have seen this contract statement removed by the insurance company if they are negotiating with the doctor directly.

If you decide to accept; this is only the beginning of the process. In this situation, you will then work for about the next 2-3 months to fill out all paperwork and wait for their credentialing application to join their network committee to approve your application. This seems crazy, but some insurance companies only have committees that meet one half day a month, and so you might have to wait months before they get to your application.

However; some insurance companies come back with rates that you are not sure you can afford to accept.

To find chair time, you will want to put in the expected total cost for all office expenses, minus clinical staff hours. If you put those costs into the box on the right hand side of the page, then you will come up with what it costs to run a chair per hour in your office. Once you find that number; you can add that into the left part where you add up how much chair time each procedure might take.

In the case of the crown, you will also sometimes have a build up procedure, and so this is separated out. Then the final part is if you have a separate crown seat appointment. For those of you with CEREC or in-office milling capabilities, this part will still be part of the main appointment:

It is important to remember that you will need to include all costs from sterilization as well: This will include the full cycle of the procedure; from setting up, completing the procedure, sterilizing the room and instruments, and then getting it all the way back to clean.

Once you know exactly how much each procedure costs you to complete, that will give you a better idea of whether you will want to accept certain fees by certain insurance companies. You might find that you're willing to accept these fees at first; but it is important to remember that your choice to be in-network or out-of-network can always change over time. Even though some patients might leave the practice over in-network status, a certain portion will stay and pay the fees even if you're out of network:

The goal is to only write off less than 40% of your UCR fees to most insurances. This can always vary per procedure, but in total, if you're billing out $100,000 to a certain insurance company over the course of a year; then you will want to hopefully be paid over $60,000 from that company plus patients, only writing off less than $40,000.

We hope that it's much better; but anything over 40% and the insurance company is probably not reimbursing you enough:

# Adding Specialty Providers

Remember that specialists usually demand, and receive, a higher fee schedule. While this is a complicated process, there's a few large keys to remember: Even if the office information stays the same on claim forms, Box 48 on claim needs to reflect the specialists information. Also, in order to receive payment; the specialist needs to add a location with the insurance plan and make sure that the insurance plan knows that they are now a providing doctor at this new location:

# Billing Entity

As you start; and especially if you're doing this yourself, remember these key points about the billing entity versus the treating doctor: Remember to always put the billing entity in Box 48 on your claim. This means that the billing entity will get paid for services completed. Keep in mind that the rendering provider is the individual completing the work but not always the one getting paid.
---
paid by the insurance. This would include situations where you have an associate doctor and an owner:

# Here's a few notes and things we have seen with associate and owner complications:

- Provider might have many locations
- Provider might have their own practices
- Checks might be sent to those other offices, electronic checks are preferred to easily track payments AND prevent fraud
- Do not add an associate as a billing entity
- If you are adding a location you can use the same tax ID

Remember that with a new tax ID, you have to re-credential provider with all insurances. This is typical with most acquisitions, as well as startups: With your new startup, your new Tax ID will have a clean history with insurances, which will offer a unique opportunity: This is actually the best time to negotiate with insurances because the lack of history will not give them anything to decrease your payments with.

# Hiring an Insurance Negotiator

There are already a few other areas where hiring an outside expert can save time and money: Sometimes this is an easy decision and sometimes you might have enough expertise to do it yourself at the same level or better: In our experience, hiring an outside insurance negotiation company is preferred due to the time and complexity of the insurance landscape. There are strategies that are changing weekly and monthly, and sometimes getting the right mixture, connections, and fee schedules can be the difference between receiving $671 for a D2740 vs $1,301 for the same procedure. Once you get better rates on a few items, paying the fees for insurance negotiations is a no-brainer:

While we won't give any credence to any negotiation companies in writing here, we do have a few favorites and those might change over time. To find the ones that we trust at the moment; head on over to the Dental Success Network's private portal. Inside the network you can reach out to see who we are using these days, and what the approximate price is. Sometimes we even get better vendor savings than what is out in the public.

Typically you will see fees for a startup negotiation anywhere between $4,000 and $6,500. This is an investment, and we think it's a great use of time, especially at the dollars per hour that most dentists make. Also remember that the outcome that an insurance negotiation company will get you, might be exponentially better than what we can get ourselves.

# Timeline and Details

Remember to start the insurance negotiation process about 6 months prior to opening: This process takes much longer than expected, and so planning for that will help you be in-network with as many as possible from the day you open your doors: Some insurances will even still be

# Insurance Company Negotiation Checklist

|Insurance Company|Recieved all Paperwork|Terminated paperwork to complete|Submitted to Company|Confirmation that they have paperwork|In-Network Information|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Aetna| | | | | |Most recent mailed paperwork on 1/15th.|
|Ameritas| | | | | | |
|Assurant| | | | | | |
|Blue Cross| | | | | | |

Above is a snapshot of the spreadsheet we provide that includes a simple checklist of insurance companies and what stage of the process you might be in for going in-network. Use this to track where you are with each company, as it will get confusing very fast with multiple companies going at the same time.

As you start to negotiate, you will need to have a few things set up:

1. Company/Clinic website with a phone number
2. Company email account
3. Phone number set up
4. Fax number set up
5. Mailing address

It seems crazy to set up a website that early on, but some insurance companies will check your website and want to call your number for verification. Even a super simple website will work for these purposes. Similarly with email, phone number; fax number; and mailing address, you will need all these for them to connect and verify your identity. You will want to set up a company email account on Google Business Suite or similar platform to receive emails. You can even set up a Google Voice phone number if your phones aren't set up. In case you're going to use Mango Phones, you can get set up with a virtual number many months before you actually receive your physical phones. With Fax, Mango Voice can also set up a virtual fax machine where faxes come in and out just like email: And of course, the mailing address is the trickiest; sometimes if you are going to a new construction/build or otherwise. In these cases, use your home address as the 'mailing address' and the office address as 'service' address.

In all, insurances can absolutely help bring a great flow of patients into the office from day one. Usually we know it's part of the game and we accept this, but trying to maximize value for us and for the patients will bring financial stability and success to us much quicker!

The last document we will share with you that will help as you get started is the Insurance Verification Form: This form is a very comprehensive form that will cover almost anything that you could need in an insurance verification. While comprehensive, it might be overkill for most practices. The best thing to do here is cut out any questions you do not need asked, and simplify this down to the form that you need in your practice. Of course, just like insurance negotiations, sometimes it will be better to outsource this as well.

# Construction, Cabinetry and Equipment

The longest part of any startup is the construction phase. Incidentally, it is also the most expensive. It is long and pricey, and it might feel like the project will never come to fruition. However, with the right information and vendors, the construction part of the project can also be the largest area to save money:

Now that we have covered site selection and floor plans, I’ll have the plan in place to get you ready for construction. The steps preceding actually starting any construction is to actually prepare from a legal side to either sign a lease or purchase some land. Let us take a look at leases first since that is probably more common with most startups.

# Lease

There are a few different kinds of leases that are available. However, the last type is most common for most landlords. Here's a quick rundown of the types of leases:

- Gross Rent Lease: one amount for all rent and incidentals, single monthly amount. This is by far the simplest for the tenant and landlord; however, the landlord might be stuck with increases in other costs, and so it's not extremely common.
- Modified Gross Rent: landlord and tenant share a portion of all expenses. This type of lease is not very common in most commercial settings.
- Net Leases: rent is paid to landlord; then tenant pays all other incidentals.
- Triple Net (NNN): tenant pays all taxes, insurance, and maintenance on building. The triple net lease is by far the most common type of lease because the landlord covers their portion and then it is up to the tenant to cover all other costs.
- Percentage Rent Lease: tenant pays base rent and then a percentage of sales over time. This is not very common in most commercial real estate; however, it is used mostly in malls and shopping centers.

As you start to try to negotiate a lease, we recommend getting yourself your own real estate broker: A good real estate broker will meet with you to go over your budget; goals, financial profile and help identify properties if you haven't already. After identifying them, they will set up tours and help you negotiate the top three spots. Hopefully you already have your top spots, but if the landlord in the top spot is not able to match the economics you'll need, then you need to be able to walk away and go to your next option.

# Things to Look at When Negotiating a Lease

- Look at your sublease clauses to evaluate opportunities to pay rent and avoid a hefty termination penalty
- Negotiate common area maintenance fee increases by writing in a "cap" in your lease agreement
- Set your occupancy date to take physical possession of the property before your rent date
- Have a clause for 'first right-of-refusal' to purchase the building
- Always ask for Tenant Improvement Buildout Costs: Typically ask for about $30-60/Sq. Ft: for buildout costs from the tenant. Average would be $35/Sq. Ft:

And of course there's always stories where a lease negotiator failed their client: Although many are well-meaning, if they forget something it can cause you great harm down the road: Here's a list of some of the biggest negotiation failures we have seen:

- If there's a relocation clause landlord with 30 days notice can move a tenant into a 'similar space' within the shopping center
- Landlord requires certain working hours
- Mechanics liens: a lien that could stop the tenant from working if a mechanic files legal paperwork: To solve this, try to make sure the tenant has a right to work around any liens from contractors. (Bonding around a lien)

So there are good things and bad things, but here are some other points to negotiate and keep in mind as you're trying to get a lease signed.

- When to return a security deposit? Ask for 5 years
- Ask for specific inflators on the % so that you can know the exact cost over the life of the lease
- Try to get a 10 year with 2x (5 year options) so that you can amortize your investment over 20 years, even to have the option for more is a good idea
- Ask for Latent Defect protection - landlord would pay for any defects that come to light in the building after tenant already moved in (ie. foundation, roof; etc)
- Make sure you find someone who only represents tenants
- A good negotiator will educate the landlord on the aspects of why having a dental tenant is a good idea
- Remember that even mid-lease you can hire a re-negotiator to help
- When re-negotiating - you'll need about 12 months lead time prior to termination to fully negotiate the lease
---
Just because neighbor is paying S2O/NNN doesn't mean you should be paying that. each tenant is individual.

You need your own broker in any project; do not just call up the name on the sign, it is NOT a do-it-yourself project: We have done it correctly, and we've done it absolutely horribly as well: The lease is one of the most fixed, longest costs that you'll have in the practice. You don't do construction on a do-it-yourself basis, nor architectural drawings, nor equipment; so remember that a lease will cost more than all of those put together:

So, if we were to boil lease negotiations down to the top 10 items that are the most important; you will want to make sure you've covered your bases with all of these points:

1. Always negotiate a cap on lease net costs (maintenance and insurance)
2. Never let a landlord limit certain working hours
3. Always have Latent Defect protection - make sure any structural issues won't be your responsibility to fix
4. Know the exact inflators over the life of the lease
5. Get your security deposit back after a few years
6. Ask the buyer for $30-60 sq. ft in Tenant Improvement (TI) (Ave. $35 sq ft)
7. Always keep the ability to audit the Triple Net Costs
8. If you sell the practice, make sure your lease holds over to the next person
9. Make sure your landlord can't move you to another 'similar' spot
10. Review lease termination/renegotiation conditions if your strip center or location goes into foreclosure (Security Non-Disturbance Clause)
11. Ownership change of building doesn't break the lease

# Land and Ground-Up Construction

While it is less common to do ground up construction, sometimes that is the only option. Usually ground up construction takes much longer; but the rewards are getting a building that is 100% what your heart is set on. As you start the process, remember that from the birth of the idea through opening day might take 18-24 months. Land acquisition is probably the longest and most boring part of the process, and this usually takes 6-8 months for site selection and land acquisition:

Buying land is a long process, and it is mostly due to the fact that all the land rights and paperwork are very arduous. In the process, there are a few things to remember about buying a piece of earth that will forever be yours. You'll want to engage a realtor and negotiator early on in the process: They will help you find land that may or may not be publicly for sale. Remember that negotiators for buyers do not cost YOU any money: Their payment always comes from the seller:

When looking at ground; there's a few considerations to evaluate:

Ingress and Egress from the site
---
Will the municipality allow for slow-down lanes off major streets, or will they even allow access to the land at all off the major roadway? Can guests turn left into the site? Sometimes there is a concrete median that will not allow for access.

# 10%-25% of the site is buildable

The rest of the site will be parking, sidewalks, and greenspace. This can be greatly affected by 'set-backs', which are legal zones where you cannot put parking or building:

In the case where the setback seems excessive, you can always ask for permission to put signage or parking on this area, even if you cannot build on it:

For set-backs, make sure to have a complete understanding of the rules and regulations surrounding this, because it greatly devalues the land in that specific area: Build that price decrease into your offer; and make sure you explain why you would be decreasing the price due to those factors.

# Future demographics

Remember that even though an area looks empty today, in 2 years there might be 10,000 people living in a mile radius.

# Prior history of the dirt

To evaluate a piece of land, you will most likely be required to do a Phase Environmental Assessment: This is a paperwork exercise that goes through the history of the property to see if there were ever any uses on the property that might warrant soil testing or evaluation: This would include gas stations, dry cleaners, or chemical factory-type uses. They are usually $1,500-3,000 and take a few weeks to complete:

In the case that a Phase 1 Assessment finds something, then you will need a Phase 2 Assessment: A Phase 2 is when engineers will come and take soil samples from different points on the lot to see if there's actual contamination: This can sometimes be $3,000-10,000 and can take 2 months:

# Example Calculation

Let's run through an example to explain. Let us assume that you want to build an office that has 8 operatories. With our general formula, we will assume that 8 X 330 square feet per operatory equals 2640 square feet. With that size of building, we will most likely need a piece of land that is 10,560 square feet (if the building can take up 25% of the area), all the way up to 26,400 square feet (if the building can take up 1% of the area).

# Timeline of the Process

The timeline of the process after land acquisition is still long: While a lease space already has the shell, you will now need to design and build the shell before you get to finish off the interior:

The shell can be anywhere between $80 per square foot all the way up to $150 per square foot depending on style of building and basement needs. Obviously, a basement adds much more cost, but is typically not needed in most dental offices. The shell process will most likely take 4-6 months depending on weather and contractor availability:

Following all those initial steps and phases, now you can continue with the interior design and building; which follows the same or similar path in both leasehold improvements as well as new.
---
# Construction

Construction is the most variable part of any project. In general, there are so many individual pieces of the project throughout the construction phase that it might become hard to give any advice on this part of the project: However; we will try here. In previous chapters we have described how to pick the right contractor: We hope that will help find a good company or person to help you navigate this part of the project:

In that last chapter; we had a lot of questions, but we find it important to review one question in particular:

# What is your cost structure?

- Bid, construction manager at risk or cost-plus?

The 'Bid' process is where a contractor gives you a price for building your dental practice. For example, that can be $500,000 for the project. In that bid, they are making many assumptions, but to a certain extent; they will stick to that price as long as nothing about the project changes. Now built into their assumptions is certain 'levels' of cabinetry, countertops, flooring, etc. If you decide you want granite on that surface rather than laminate, you will get up-charged. Here is where the price can start to creep upwards. In these situations, this is called a 'change-order' and you will get charged an extra fee on top of the regular bid price to fulfill this change-order:

Construction manager-at-risk is a way where the contractor gives you a final price and then the promise to keep the price underneath that dollar amount or else they eat the overage costs. This is common in some municipal contracts, but extremely rare in dental construction:

Our most preferred method of payment and contract is the 'cost-plus' model. In this scenario, the contractor gives you some approximate numbers at the beginning of the project to run your financials off of. They will say these prices, but the way they are paid is off of their costs, plus their profit margin: For example, they might say that they expect all the costs of the project to add up to $450,000, and then the profit margin is 10% on top of that cost: So in that scenario they would get an extra $45,000 in profit; for a total of $495,000.

The cost-plus model is most likely the best because the contractor is only paid on the work they do for you, and there is no funny business. Often in a contractor's contract you will want to make sure it is 'open-book', which means that you get to review and see ALL invoices throughout the project: Sometimes untruthful contractors will add in extra costs, but if there is an open book policy, then you can see and review all expenses anytime you want: In some projects, you can even negotiate that you will pay all subcontractors directly; thereby saving a few percentage points on the profit margin if the general contractor does not have to carry that cost for any number of days.
---
In the cost-plus model, remember that the profit margin is absolutely negotiable. They will often have a regular margin they ask for; but this can be negotiated as long as you can give them things that might be of value to them: This includes faster payment, or possibly paying their subcontractors directly from yourself.

In general, the contractor will be your partner through about 6-12 months of this process. You will hopefully get along with them well, but in the end you need to remember they work for YOU. You will be holding them accountable throughout the process and they may not like it. In fact; it's usually the case that they do not like this at all. There might be hard feelings as you find things about the project that did not go as planned and they will need to come back and fix them: This is very typical in all construction projects, so just make sure that you keep this in mind and take all interactions with a grain of salt.

# Operatory Design and Equipment

The biggest place to be efficient and save money during the construction process is through proper operatory design: If you have been to any number of dental offices, you will have seen many different designs for operatories that will mix in any combination of cabinetry and dental units:

# Room Design

In general, there are a few different designs that we can review here. For those of us who have acquired offices, we have been able to try out a few different designs. As a startup, you are not tied to any historical precedent, and so you can make your own choice and decide which positives mean more to you than any of the negatives.

The first operatory design we will look at is the normal operatory with cabinets on both sides. In this picture, the dentist can be grabbing the operative handpieces from either the side cabinet, or on a bar that comes from the dental chair:

|Pros:|Cons:|
|---|---|
|Assistant has lots of space and can rotate from the back to the side to get supplies| |
|Space available for specialty equipment like implants, IV sedation, or endodontics| |
|Patients generally do not see the handpieces or equipment| |
|Can be converted from left-handed to right-handed generally well; as long as it is built with rear-delivery| |
---
Disinfection/cleaning of treatment space is labor intensive (not a quick turnaround time).

Doctor and assistant might be forced to turn widely for utilization of all counter spaces.

Room has lots of cabinetry; which is expensive and can lead to lots of supplies getting left in cabinetry over time.

Supplies are not easily accessible for neither doctor/assistant.

By far this first design is the one where the most space is wasted. Typically we have seen these operatories to be about 10 feet wide, and then there is lots of expense tied up in plumbing if there is a sink on one or both sides.

If we were to cut out one of the cabinets and try to save possibly 1-2 feet in width, what would that look like?

# Side delivery

Pros:

- Smaller room size - typically 8-9 feet in width and still 12 feet in height.
- Handpieces can be hidden underneath the side cabinet.

Cons:

- Disinfection/cleaning of treatment space is slightly labor intensive.
- Assistant is trapped in room.
- The cabinetry is still more than usually needed and can lead to overstocking and extra expense.
- If you try to convert from a right-handed person to a left-handed person, the conversion is poor: supplies within a small range-of-motion.
- Doctor or assistant cannot reach all range-of-motion.
- Specialty equipment (procedure carts) cannot be mobily deployed.

You never know whether you will employ a hygienist or a dentist who might be left handed or right handed: Having operatories that are built for only a right handed person can be a nightmare if you are about to bring on a new person who is not ambidextrous: For this reason, the above operatory design is a poor choice in most scenarios.

By far one of the most popular designs is the rear-delivery design with a smaller room profile. In the next picture, you will see what it looks like to have no side cabinetry, as well as a rear delivery: In recent years, this has become the most ubiquitous design and is very popular for both cost savings and great working styles. Here are some of the major features:
---
# Over the head delivery

# Pros:

- Smaller room size- as small as 7'6" wide
- Inexpensive to build
- Space available for specialty equipment if you decide to use mobile carts
- Handpieces close from the 12 o'clock position
- Assistant free to enter and exit the room via a second doorway
- Great for dentistry from 7 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions
- Patients do not see handpieces or dental equipment when they enter the room
- Conversion of the room from a right-handed setup to a left-handed setup can be done quickly

# Cons:

- Handpieces may be at doctor's non-dominant hand
- Some doctors are not used to having the assistant hand them all their handpieces, can be a learning process

While the rear delivery option like the one above is quite popular; it's actually not the cheapest. This is due to the cabinetry in the rear needing to be slightly specialized and larger due to housing the dental unit. The next scenario fixes that while adding in a few other aspects which might make or break the plan:

# Over the patient delivery

# Pros:

- Smaller room size still 7'6" as the narrowest design
- Inexpensive to build
- Space available for mobile carts
- Handpieces based off chair and can be switched from right handed to left handed in most equipment very quickly

# Cons:

- Doctor must reach slightly to side to grab handpieces
- Assistant is sometimes trapped if not given the second doorway in the design
- Dental equipment is visually seen by the patient when walking into the room

Throughout all these designs it is important to make a decision based upon what you think will be best for you over the next 15-20 years. Salespeople and consultants will tell you many different pros and cons as they try to steer you one way or the other; but in the end, it is your decision.
---
decision. Try to look at all the pros and cons to see exactly which type of room and cabinetry fit your style: Once you have that; it will start to set your budget for the room cabinetry and will then dictate what sort of decisions you have to make next:

# Lighting

After figuring out where the operatory setup will be housed, and where you have cabinetry, your next choice will be to decide on where the operatory light will be housed. There are typically five different options:

1. Overhead stable mount position coming off of one point
2. Overhead sliding track over the patient
3. Wall-mounted off the doctor or assistant side
4. Chair mounted
5. No lights - doctors and assistants wear headlamps all the time

From a cost standpoint; the overhead mounts are most expensive because it creates a need for the contractor to put extra backing in the ceiling and this can be quite a bit of work. If you want to put a TV on the ceiling, it can also create a point where they will not work together due to hitting one another:

A wall mounted option is sometimes sold by major vendors. This is just a nightmare due to shoulder rotation pulling from far off to the side. We do not recommend these options - both due to the muscular strain as well as having to add power in another point in the room which is another added expense.

The best two options in our opinion are the chair mounted light; or no lights at all: You can purchase headlamps that are very high quality off the internet for about $40 a kit; with multiple batteries included. For this cost; the added cost of many thousands of dollars for an overhead light will seem crazy:

The other best option is the chair mounted light: While sometimes consultants will say that patients do not like visualizing the light; we do not think it is a large enough detriment to cut it out. When it is based off the chair; there is no extra cost in electrical or structural add-ons. The added cost into the dental equipment is usually a few hundred dollars at best, so the cost is economical as well:

# Cabinetry

The cabinetry needs of the practice are mostly based on the room design. Cabinets are beautiful sometimes, and most dental salespeople will try to sell you large banks of cabinets. However; we have always thought that cabinets are just used to store supplies and sometimes those supplies age and get forgotten in the back of the cabinets, thereby wasting supplies and driving up costs. In our opinion, less is better:
---
Also remember that cabinets are very permanent: While they can be changed, sometimes it is prohibitively expensive and then you'll be repairing drywall, flooring and other things that are very expensive. So, once you put them in, they will most likely be there for 15 years.

When looking at cabinets, remember that most of the time local cabinet shops are very good and can give you the same level of quality as the large 'dental' manufacturers can: When choosing a cabinet maker; you should be able to choose the types of laminate that are both on the inside of the units, as well as custom laminate choices for the outside. Any laminate that can be used on a countertop can also be used on the outside of cabinets, for both sides and fronts of all the units. To get an idea of the types of laminates available, go to any local countertop or cabinet store, and then they will have all the small samples like the picture shown: The top right laminate in the picture is Wilsonart Laminate 7947K-18. Asian Night Premium Aeon. Check out Wilsonart for both their premium line of laminates as well as the more economical choices.

It is typically best to design the cabinet 100% yourself from scratch, as there typically is not much added cost to this level of customization. When designing, ask for specific things like soft-drawer closing features, or thinner edging to the corners of the doors and drawers.

To help you build the best cabinet; use the Sketchup Program to decide which is best and what features you want:

# Junction Boxes

When building the operatory, you'll need your dental equipment to hook into water; compressed air; and suction in a certain place. This is usually named the junction box and is typically a cluttered, compressed mess of cords, hoses and power outlets. There are a couple of ways this can typically look.

# Above the ground:

Many old practices have it this way, and the box is typically right underneath the foot of the patient chair: This is very normal for older practices; but sometimes can be kicked often from patients as they leave the chair:
---
# In-Wall:

This is becoming more popular; and mostly because there is nothing on the floor to get damaged or kicked. However; there is going to be a 2" line that goes from the patient chair to the wall, so there is a slight annoyance to be cleaning a floor and having to move around this added hose. Many architects will also warn you about patients tripping over this cord, but that is typically overkill and we have virtually never seen that happen.

Cost of this option is generally quite good because you can add it into existing spaces easily if the ceiling can be accessed easily: Generally all the air; suction, water; and power come from overhead, and are run into the wall space. The biggest hindrance in this is making sure you have a large enough suction to pull the fluids up the wall: However; when you have the proper equipment; then this setup is the most economical and still looks very clean:

# In-Floor

This option shown (above right) is by far the cleanest look, however it does take some planning ahead and extra cost. When ordering from specific vendors, they will send you the plastic box and preliminary cover over the box to then mount your flooring to. Inside this box is all the general things, with custom hose holes cut out for the hoses coming out of the floor: This removes the clunky box at the base of the chair; and also creates a very clean look in the operatory:

# Sterilization

One of the biggest mistakes we have seen in sterilization is that often the spaces do not have a good flow: We have seen beautiful cabinetry that; for one reason or another; does not actually work for most dental professionals.

It is of great importance to make sure that you plan this area with great specificity and make sure that it will work for your uses and that your team will actually be able to execute sterilization with efficiency:

# Few notes about sterilization:

- Make sure your sterilization has a flow
- You don't want any backtracking if possible
- Make sure there is a clear "dirty" and "clean" side or section
- Organization is key; plan for each piece of equipment
- Consider exhaust/steam from sterilizer (especially if they are inside cabinetry) when choosing materials
---
Typically if the sterilizer is set into a box in a cabinet; make sure the interior of this box is sealed with caulk and quartz countertop on all sides including the top aerosol of ultrasonic in mind when planning the organization of supplies (nothing above to avoid contamination)

Using the Blocking Diagram Spreadsheet given out earlier to help you plan the areas of Breakdown, Sterilization, and Restocking:

Another common error we see in sterilization is keeping too many doors on cabinets. We are not a fan of this unless it's required by OSHA standards because we find that cabinet doors leads to over stocking of supplies and losing track of things you have: We have also found that less cabinetry usually leads to a cleaner look.

We suggest keeping the cabinetry and shelving very simple at the beginning, and if you need shelving in the future you can always add it in yourself.

The picture shown is a great example of starting with less complex cabinetry at the start. As needed in the future, you can then add more shelving yourself further down the line.
---
# Restocking and Storage:

An often overlooked area of any new office is the counter-space and storage needs that will contribute to efficiency and maintaining a good percentage spend on supply costs. The biggest thing we can teach in this area is that clear tip-out bins are the absolute best cost you will ever incur:

The picture to the side shows an example of what is needed in almost 90% of practices. These clear tip-out bins are sold from a company called Simplastics, and a set of these is usually $600-800. This includes the larger bins towards the bottom of the wall, medium in the middle, and smaller towards the top: This usually also includes a rack on the back of them that is mounted to the wall so that all these bins actually stack into a metal track and stay stable as a single unit. We highly recommend these units as it makes re-stocking very easy and quick.

There are also the smallest tip out bins that are about 2 inches wide by 2 inches tall. These are great for managing your collection of burs, and can actually be set up to match your bur block with the same burs in each 'spot' on the block and in the tip-out bins:

Another idea to keep in mind in your sterilization and restocking area is that packages from the dental supply companies come in every few days. Sometimes these are small boxes, but oftentimes a delivery person will drop a huge pile of boxes and it can clog up traffic. One idea to mitigate this mess is to create some counter space that is 'floating' with no cabinet underneath it: Sometimes this is a great spot for a small refrigerator for some dental materials, but it can also be used as an area where you can put packages as they come into the practice.

# Compressor

If you do not have compressed air; the practice is hypothetically dead in the water: With this equipment; it is important to remember that you should invest in good equipment and make sure that you have a service technician on call who can fix these things when and if they break:

# Here are some notes on the air compressor:

- Air quality and dryness
- Both oil-less and lubricated compressors are used in dentistry
- If you go with oiled there will be a filter
---
# Dryer in the compressor- good idea, but not always necessary

Noise level-typically 60-70 decibels

Use an acoustic hood or special wall designed to mitigate noise

Having 2 "Heads" will sometimes decrease wear; and create a backup, but not always

More moving parts=more chance of failure

# Good questions to ask when buying a unit from a salesperson:

- How many 'heads' on a compressor unit?
- How many ops per size of the compressor in their opinion

It's a safe bet that you rely on compressed air; yet the compressor is usually thought of only when purchased or when it demands immediate attention. In addition, dental compressors are often selected based on purchase price and quick availability criteria that rarely lead to acquiring a quality product. Since a practice cannot run without them, it makes sense to pay attention to what you buy:

# Sizing your compressor

To properly size a compressor; you need to know your air consumption and the capacity of the compressor: Consumption is usually determined by how many operatories are in use at a time. Capacity is the compressor output in cubic feet per minute (cfm), and can usually be found in product literature. As a rule of thumb, each chair needs approximately 2 cfm.

Dental compressor suppliers often simplify all this and just tell how many users a compressor will support. This is helpful, but you must check the duty cycle and actual flow to ensure you're getting what you expect. Product literature may state pump displacement but not true capacity; which is a combination of actual volume output, duty cycle, and tank size.

"Duty cycle" the percentage of time a compressor can run without having to cool off.

EX: Some compressors have a 30% duty cycle. This does not mean it can run three hours straight in a 10-hour day; but more like 18 mins an hour.

The key point is that two compressors may put out the same cfm, but the one with the lower duty cycle cannot run as much without reducing its service life. Duty cycle varies widely among compressors, so ask your supplier about it:

# Air quality

Compressed air quality depends on the inlet air and what the compressor adds to it. Both oil-less and lubricated compressors are used in dentistry: Both require particulate filters to remove any airborne dirt and dust. With a lubricated compressor, the system must also include reliable coalescing filters to ensure patient safety.

Most dental compressors include a dryer to remove moisture. The common types are desiccant and membrane. Both types use air to purge the saturated desiccant material or membranes. This reduces the air available chairside. When selecting, consider how much dried, compressed air is needed for the purge.
---
Manufacturers make choices in design and materials to meet target price points, so quality varies widely: Following are some points to consider when comparing compressors.

Heads should be made of quality materials and designed to remove heat: Finned cylinders, large cooling fans, and filters are important features. Components should be designed to be serviced, not replaced.

Other signs of quality include robust tubing and fittings, as well as good vibration isolation to prevent loose wires and fittings. This will often look like rubber feet and springs at different places on the equipment.

In general, we think that having a two-head, oil-less compressor is best; but we are agnostic about the brand: We are, however, not agnostic about price point or the systems to have a backup ready at the drop of a hat. We know that going without a compressor might mean a loss of $15,000 in production in a day; so we need to make sure to have a backup option ready to go immediately.

In this scenario, we follow a protocol of the 'Critical 4 Inventory'. We keep an equipment spreadsheet on all the largest units in the office and what happens if one of them goes down: The Big 4 includes the server; the sterilizer; the compressor; and the suction unit. Download the document from the vault to get access.

# Suction Unit

There are two major types of suction units that can be used in dentistry, wet or dry: In older offices, the wet vac was the most common type. This uses water run side-by-side to then create a suction which then powers the suction to the operatories. However, in recent years the dry vac has become more popular because water usage is expensive and wasteful: Here are some notes on vacuums as well as questions to ask a salesperson who can help you purchase these units.

# What are the major differences between the older vacuum units and the newer wet and dry vacuum systems?

Both systems work well for dentistry: However, a new wet vac creates up to 15" Hg suction pressure while a new dry vac (some but not all) creates up to 25" Hg. This provides the power and performance that the dentist expects from the vacuum system: This is probably the single most important factor to consider when selecting a new vacuum and should be carefully researched. (Some dry vacs produce only 8" Hg suction pressure.)

# How does the decreased water consumption benefit the practice?

Wet dental vacuums use clean, fresh, drinking water to create suction power for the dental practice, ½ gallon per minute per horsepower: Most dental offices use 2 x 2 hp wet vacs (2 gallons per minute or 200,000 gallons per year): All Canadian municipalities currently meter water/sewage (or will in the near future) and charge according to usage. The above usage rate of the typical wet vac translates to an average cost of $2000 per year for a dental practice.
---
# The new "dry" vacuums are "oil-free" What does this mean from a practitioner's perspective?

Many of the currently available dry vacs utilize oil in their motors for lubrication and cooling, much like a car. The "oil" dry vacs therefore exhaust oil vapors which pollute their immediate environment. They also require regular oil maintenance. The newer dental dry vacs can create a powerful vacuum without using oil. Carbon fiber vanes eliminate the need for oil in the process. There are no oil levels to check, no oil to add, no oil to change, and most importantly, no oil in the exhaust that can be harmful to people and animals, and can cause severe damage to a roof or building exterior.

Draining the vacuum system is always a chore for the staff. Typically dry systems have a 'tank' where all the suction contents go. Many systems will have an automatic function whereby when you turn off the vacuum, it will do about a 5-10 minute auto-clean cycle.

Bacterial buildup in the vacuum system has always been an unspoken concern. Do the "dry" vacuums offer any benefits? Dry vacs do not have any water flow; and thus no concerns for backflow or bacterial contamination. No backflow preventers are required.

When the vacuum system is installed in close proximity to the operatories or reception area, it can be very loud. Do the newer vacuum systems improve on noise management? Vacuums now are typically variable speed and so make more or less noise based upon the needs of whenever suction lines are opened in the operatories. Typically they are quieter than past models which sounded like a constant 'jet engine' noise.

# How big is the vacuum unit these days?

Typically both the compressor and the vacuum can be stored in about a 3 feet deep by 4 feet wide closet, as long as you have 8 feet of height to place a shelf in the middle. The compressor can sit on the floor and the vacuum on top of it. The vacuum unit is about the size of a large pot and the tank is slightly larger than that.

Dry vacs, unlike wet vacs, require an air/water separator to hold the collected debris. A 6-12 gallon tank can be attached to the motor or installed at any location in the plumbing system. This tank drains any material it collects automatically.

# How complicated is the installation of the "dry" vacuum system that replaces the existing "wet" unit; and how long does it take?

Today, most dental dry vacs fit the same plumbing pipes that wet vacs use. The most popular wet vac plumbing size is 1-1/2". It is important for the dentist to confirm that their new dry vac system conforms to this standard. The time it takes for an experienced technician to switch from a wet to a dry vac is the same as the time to replace a wet system.

Calculate that it's about ½ a gallon of water for each horsepower every minute.
---
So possibly up to about 200,000 gallons of water a year; or about $2,000 in extra water bill a year. Of course each area is different; but talk to your dental representative to see exactly what you need in terms of suction power as well as what your local regulations require. In general, most of the vacuums we've seen installed recently are dryvacs.

# Autoclave

Typically the last important piece of equipment I'll need to review is the autoclave. Without an autoclave in good working condition, your practice will be closed very quickly: So, how do you decide what you need?

Generally you'll need to evaluate how fast you'll be seeing patients and the number of providers seeing patients as well. There's a ton of variables, but in our experience, there's pretty much only one way to go with a sterilizer; and it is to go larger at first to make room for growth. Our go-to recommendation is the Midmark M-11 Ultraclave. It is by far the most widely used unit in all of dentistry and medicine. This means that the parts are easily findable; the maintenance is minimum; and it has the capacity to deal with quite a bit of growth in your practice before you'd need to look for any other options.

If you start with an M-11 unit, the only thing you'll need to consider in the future is when your growth will outweigh the capabilities of this unit: At that point, then you'll need to look at a Statim or other unit to add on.

# Office Furniture and Working Furniture

Office furniture and waiting room furniture can be a place where you could either save big or spend big: In some medical office furniture showrooms, you will see waiting room chairs for $800 a piece: These are great chairs of course, and they will last you a long time, but if you're having to buy any number of them, it will start to add to your costs extremely quickly.

With office chairs and desks for doctors and staff, there's a few things we've learned to keep costs down and still have great quality: Here's a few notes on these areas:

# Waiting Room Design Tips

- Place furniture as you would at home
- Add end tables and put plenty of space between seats
- Try to avoid typical lines and rows

WayFair website has good options for couches, chairs and tables:

Almeda Side Chair is $105/chair as seen in picture.
---
Keep clean and neat (both by looks and health wise)

Flowers and plants add a touch of warmth; but don't over do it

Avoid strong smelling disinfectants

Quiet reception music can be used as a good sound control

Pleasant; vague outdoor scenes are usually safest for pictures/images displayed on walls

Televisions are seen differently by everyone

Some see it as an inconvenience (who controls the remote? What if people don't want to be forced to listen to it?)

Others see it as a relaxation mechanism

Create a space that is friendly to all ages (children-elderly)

For office furniture, we also recommend Wayfair or other websites. The working chairs we have purchased from these sites are significantly cheaper than normal office furniture, and they do have a good lifespan:

Possibly the most ground-breaking idea we have tried in the offices we have built is to do stand-up desks in the doctor office. While trying to save money on cabinetry; we have tried this idea with good success. See the picture aside. While built-in cabinets are expensive, they are also very permanent: With a doctor's office that might someday be switched to an operatory, these desks are a simple way to go that builds in versatility as well as cost savings. The typical powered stand-up desk like this is $500 and looks very modern and sleek. The small form factor PC is then put on the back of the computer screen, or under mounted on the desk.

Overall, employing a few of these furniture ideas will surely save you tens of thousands over regular furniture, but it will also save you many thousands on reducing cabinetry as well: It is good to remember that any architect will definitely try to steer you away from these cost-saving techniques, however it is important to hold your own and make sure you stick to these rules when trying to save money on the buildout.

# Chapter 7

# Technology and Softwares

When it comes to technology and softwares in the practice, there are seemingly a million options. With many options however; there are also quite a few options that can be enticing at first; but come with strings attached later: In this chapter; we will help you through the process to make sure that you get the end product you want; at the price you can afford.

At the beginning of the process, you will need to figure out where you want all your computers, printers, phones and other equipment. During the construction phase, you'll need to find where you want all these things so that an electrician can put in electrical and data lines: Of course Wi-Fi can run many things, but the truth is that wireless connections are typically much slower than actual cabling, and present many more problems. So we will start with the process of figuring out where to place things.

# Physical Placement of Tech in the Office

As you begin this process, you’ll want to start with the floorplan of the office. An example is on the next page. When you look at the floor plan, you will want to use the following system to place where you want each of these points in the key below. Placing colored dots, or any insignia, next to where you want these things, will help the subcontractor understand exactly what you want: Remember that these subcontractors are not dentists, and they do not understand the efficiencies of proper placement:

To start; place Yellow dots wherever you will want a phone. Then place green dots wherever you will need a TV: Remember that in some places, the TV might be on the ceiling or high up on a wall. In these scenarios, you will want to have a second drawing or mock-up showing exactly what height the TV will be at:
---
In the 3-D Sketchup software, you can always mock up exactly where you will want these things, and then at the end of the project; more specific instructions lead to a more perfect outcome.

After placing phone and TV dots, then you'll want to see wherever you need Computers or possibly jumping connections between computers and TVs. Use blue dots for the computer or data drops. Each yellow and green dot will also have an accompanying blue dot since they will all run off data as well:

|[co|Lur|
|---|---|
|1|QVaD|
|1|Futurdi|
|DATA|MONITORITV|
|AudIO|MCDO|
|ALARM|Eo|
|0|lana|
|045|Photdss|
|KATCH|E0|
|CO|106|
---
After you have all those things placed, make sure that each operatory and complicated area is fully defined in terms of the exact placement of these things. Again, use Sketchup to help give subcontractors the perfect placement for any of these items: You can also add in your cabinetry, countertops; TVs and Computers into the Sketchup drawing so that they understand your final outcome. This will help them see where you are headed with the project. See the pictures here for more details.

Now all of these things run off of data of course, but you'll also need power: The universal insignia for power is a circle with two straight lines through it. Use that as a sign to show where you want power placed.

In each operatory; you will want to make sure that all the data and power needs are met; and it's never a bad idea to plan for more than possibly needed: In the operatory; there's also times when you wish a cord was available above or below a cabinet. In these scenarios, ask the subcontractor to put rounded pipes into the walls behind the cabinets and walls so that you have a channel where you can run USB cords, data cords, or anything else you need.

After you have power and data needs satisfied, the last two items are optional; audio and security alarm system. We highly recommend that the office has some sort of music playing throughout the space, and there are a few ways of doing that. One of the easiest options is having wireless Sonos speakers placed in each operatory and room throughout the practice. While slightly expensive at first; it is wireless and easily run by a phone or iPad in the office.

Another option for music would be to have music run through a central TV system that goes to each of the TVs in the ceilings in the rooms: While this can be easy, it is slightly limited because it will only play music in operatories, leaving out the waiting room. In this case, you'll want to get a different speaker or music option for the waiting room:

One of the nicest things that we have done in terms of music ambiance is to actually run an Apple TV in the main server closet; with music playing off the TV into each of the operatories. On Apple TV, they have very relaxing slow-motion video screensavers that are of some of the neatest places on earth. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, New York City skyline, the Northern lights, and many different satellite pictures floating over the earth. It is constantly revolving and is very.

aesthetic. While it does not give the patient the option to watch their favorite TV show, it does give a relaxing ambiance to the practice and can be a very easy way to have copyright free video playing all the time. To set this up, order an HDMI splitter from the internet; and then have your wiring subcontractor place HDMI cords from the closet to each operatory TV. The splitter should cost about $100 or less.

The last option is to have speakers placed into the ceiling in each operatory, hallway, and waiting room. These speakers are surprisingly cheap, sometimes about $50 per spot. Then you can have the volume control placed into the wall in each room, and the speaker wires all go back to a central controlling unit that powers and runs the sound to all of them. Sometimes this entire setup can be about $2,500 for a practice. While slightly more expensive, it does look very nice.

After you have all the other parts of the practice defined, you'll want to define exactly what the server closet looks like. Here's a few notes on that:

- Try to have a 4-plex of power in the closet: While you will be running a battery-powered backup/surge protector anyways, having extra power is always nice.
- Mount plywood into the wall of that room, and then mount as many things as possible to that plywood. If they already built in the drywall, then just mount plywood over that. See the pictures below for how to start that.
- Remember that the server should NEVER, NEVER, NEVER sit on the floor: In any case where water floods the practice, this is the recipe for disaster. Try to have shelving built in, or mount the server to the plywood so that it sits high up.
- Higher the better for all cords and everything: The more that someone could bump or move the server or any cords, the more chance that they get unhooked, and then you are running into problems.
- Do not have any sprinkler system heads in the technology closet.
- Have the ability to keep the server in a locked closet; even if the entire rest of the practice is locked, this closet needs its own door and lock.

See example pictures here for possible ideas.

While a lot of the construction planning can be done by yourself; the next stages get a lot more complicated. So the next part will help you find a good technology company to help with the needs of your new practice.

# Server; Workstations, and CBCT

# Server

As you're looking for a server; you will have to rely on the people you hire. These people should know exactly what to look for that matches your practice situation and plan for growth:

In general, you'll want to see what others have used, but here's a good example of a few options: On the lower-cost end, you could build something similar to this Intel Xeon 8 Server:

|Intel Xeon 8 Core Business-Class Server|$ 2,865.00|
|---|---|
|Includes the following: Intel Xeon processor (8M Cache, 3.40 GHz), 16GB RAM, mirrored (RAID 1) 2TB Enterprise Ultra Fast hard drives, Intel RAID controller, internal DVDRW, integrated video, 2-port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 card, 1GB server network card & 1GB failover network card|Includes the following: Intel Xeon processor (8M Cache, 3.40 GHz), 16GB RAM, mirrored (RAID 1) 2TB Enterprise Ultra Fast hard drives, Intel RAID controller, internal DVDRW, integrated video, 2-port SuperSpeed USB 3.0 card, 1GB server network card & 1GB failover network card|

However; if you're looking to build a larger practice or possibly run multiple locations off of one server; then you'll want to go a little larger: In those cases, here's another option from another manufacturer; HP. On this server bid, you will see a few things that stand out that are important for organizations that want 99.999% up-time during the course of a year: (That means approximately 4 hours of down-time per year):

One of the first things to notice here is the dual power supply: In this scenario, there are two power sources to the entire server: If one were to break down; the server can still run on the other power supply, and then a service technician could actually replace the second power supply at the appropriate time. The other option is the RAID controller and hard drives: A RAID basically a constant backup between two hard drives, so that no matter what happens, your data is secure and live on one or both of the hard drives: In the case where a hard drive breaks and you need to replace it; you could actually pull the hard drive out while the server is still active and powered: Then replacing it with a new hard drive while the server is still on, the new hard drive will program and upload all the data from the still-good hard drive. Of course this does not mean you can forget about either local backups or cloud-based backups, but this is a great way to make sure that your server will be up and running for each day you need it to.

# Workstations

As you are finishing out your equipment selections, you will need to pick the workstation computers for each operatory and desk in the office. These can get quite expensive, but we have found that staying economical works with the right software. If you are on OpenDental, you will find you do not need a fancy PC to run the software. Even most imaging software is
---
Alright to run on most workstations. For these run-of-the-mill usages, let us review the typical workstation you could purchase. The computer shown to the side here is about the ideal practice computer you would need for 90% of all uses (We will discuss CBCT uses below:) You should ideally have an i5 Intel Processor; 8 GB of Memory, and at least 256 GB hard drive.

|OptiPlex 3080 Micro|Ideally you would even go 500 GB hard drive; but that is not always needed. In general, $600-8850 per computer is ideal, so this $639 price is a great option. Also, remember that this does not include screens, mouse, keyboard, or any other accessories:|
|---|---|
|S639.00 s1098-57|You Save $459.57 (42%)|
|Free Shipping| |
|10th Generation Intel® Core i5-10500T|Windows 10 Pro 64bit English|
|8GB, 1X8GB, DDR4 non-ECC Memory|M.2 256GB PCIe NVMe Class 35 Solid State Drive|

In case you are going to be doing a lot of CBCT and 3-D planning, you'll want to super-charge your workstations that you'll be using for those needs: For those, you will not want a 'small form factor' computer; because you might need to add in a graphics card into the workstation to be able to process the CBCT images. In general, you might spend about $2,000 per computer that can manage all of those computing needs:

# Cone Beam CT Machine or Pano

Deciding on the best pantomograph or CBCT can be a stressful experience because of the high cost and the nature of buying a big piece of equipment. In general, there are two main ways to go about purchasing this that are economical. To lay the groundwork however; neither of these options include going to a large showroom of equipment and getting sold on a unit from a large company: While this seems like a very sure deal, it's also sure to buy the salesman a new car:

One of the best ways to go about buying a unit for a startup practice is to go with the company called Renew Digital. They are a national company that helps resell some new and lightly used Panos and CBCT machines. They are extremely economical and they even send the computer and a technician to come install the entire thing for you: In our experience, their customer service is high and their quality is good. We recommend checking this option out:

The other option to research is buying group deals, like the ones we get inside the Dental Success Network. The network has deals that are not publishable due to confidentiality agreements: However; you can get new units with other perks and warranties for the same price you will pay for a used unit. Check out the Dental Success Network Vendor Page for more details.

# How to hire: Technology and Service:

Hiring this person is a huge key to the success of the practice, and to mitigate headaches as you go through the entire process. Review these notes as you go through the process.

# Keys

- Most tech salesmen have incentives that are opposite of yours
- They make more money when you spend more money
- Do not sign up for a high monthly recurring service
- Try to find a service that charges per hour; typically $80-150/hour
- Get recommendations from other dental offices

# Questions to ask tech service

- What are your preferred backup methods?
- Methods should include both in-cloud and local hard drives
- Ask for current clients/referrals from existing clients - similar in size to your dental office
- Do you know how to set up an active directory from scratch?
- Do you have a list of clients?
- How do you structure recurring maintenance fees? What do you charge for (make sure they aren't nickel and dime-ing you on everything)?
- Do you have warranties on services provided?
- What are your holiday/after hours policies?
- What is your response/turnaround time on emergencies issues?
- How many employees do you have vs how many clients?
- What is your familiarity with dental tech?
- Is your software/service HIPAA compliant?
- If my server went down, how fast could you physically be on site?

# Practice Management Software

While there are seemingly endless solutions for dental software, there are a few key players that have risen to the top of the market when you're looking for the main practice management platform: Eaglesoft, Dentrix, and OpenDental are all the main names in software, but one stands out for a few reasons.

OpenDental is the only software that is truly 'open'. While it is not free, it is insanely cheap, and really all you pay for is the ongoing support fees. The support fees of around $180 for the first 6 months, dropping lower after that; also allow you to vote on new features as well as updates to the software to fix bugs and add improvements. This crowd-sourced approach to development has made them a fan favorite for more than a decade. Here's something written about them and why they are eating market share faster than Eaglesoft and Dentrix:
---
We are at a tipping point: In the next few years, Open Dental is going to be the most widely used software in dental- and every other platform will be a minor player: Place your bets now: Why should we be so confident about this?

Nathan Sparks, the CEO of Open Dental (OD), knows that OD was a startup software created by a user who just wanted it to work for what they needed- particularly for his brother; and getting better reports. So why is this startup going to rule the marketplace? Here's my bet- Disruptive Innovation.

For those who haven't heard of the term, suggest you Google it and watch Clayton Christensen- a Harvard Business professor and author of the book 'The Innovators Dilemma'. In the book, he explains how late entrants join a market and may offer a seemingly less quality product: They are often short on cash, resources, and potentially short on technology (Think Apple 1985). There are established players in the industry, that should be able to evolve, and they have all the cash and resources in the world (Think Microsoft).

The smaller players are able to maneuver the marketplace and technological curve much faster; and develop technology that tackles the needs of the customer more closely than large corporations- where the timeline for development may take many years:

From Dr. Christensen:

Characteristics of disruptive businesses, at least in their initial stages, can include: lower gross margins, smaller target markets, and simpler products and services that may not appear as attractive as existing solutions when compared against traditional performance metrics. Because these lower tiers of the market offer lower gross margins, they are unattractive to other firms moving upward in the market; creating space at the bottom of the market for new disruptive competitors to emerge.

In the case of OD, they started small- solving the problems of just Dr. Jordan Sparks' office. As a dentist; he knew what the dental industry actually needed. Rather than being driven by a large player like Henry Schein, Dr. Sparks could actually design software that solved the solutions on the ground level for all in the dental field. Oddly enough, he built it on a platform- SQL Server- that is easily attainable, and open-source. OD was also cheaper than all other options- both to start and in monthly costs. It started as a no-frills product; attacking the bottom of the market. This would make it seem like a low-quality product: That couldn't be further from the truth.

That's where Disruptive Innovation happens- at the 'seemingly' bottom of the market. For years, OD has functioned as a product that has no marketing team, and where users vote on the next feature to be added by the development team.

At first; Henry Schein and others didn't even pay attention to the fly on the wall. OD was
---
just an upstart like all the rest: HS had the money, and they were building great products like Dentrix Ascend (Hold the Laughter). Dentrix Ascend was meant to be the next 'Sustaining Innovation' where all the data could be in the cloud. This has turned into a colossal failure, and they are seeing users flee as fast as they can 're-brand' and re-unveil the software.

OD has now morphed into a major; strong dental platform. Used by corporate groups that have over 120 offices, down to the boutique dental office on the street corner: The different services that can sync into the software make it usable by many varieties of users. The reporting features make it very clear; and you can easily add more 3rd party reporting software to get higher level reports.

Since 'Disruptive Innovation' is a theory only coined in the last 20 years, it's entertaining to see it happening in the dental field. One of the most special things - and why this theory applies accurately is that OD asks its users every day to Vote on features they want. They are crowd-sourcing the next developments that users want to see. Even the CEO is on a Facebook group asking and responding to the day-to-day issues that come up. It is because of Disruptive Innovation that Open Dental is going to be the biggest dental software in the next few years:

Dr: Addison Killeen, June 2018 on Dental Success Network

So the above information points to a bit of the advantages of OpenDental over its competitors. But if we were to really list it out; here are the big advantages, in order of priority:

1. You own your entire database and all the data within it; 100% control
2. Customization of the software to meet your needs
3. Modularity - meaning you have the ability to utilize many 3rd party softwares that work well with OpenDental's platform
4. The ability to use from the cloud if you want to
5. The ability to use many different imaging softwares
6. Lowest price

# Additional Softwares

Paperless Forms, Treatment Planning; and Online Scheduling

While OpenDental does have the ability to do online scheduling, paperless forms, and other add-ons, we have had really good luck with some 3rd party providers. The two that are most chosen by the members of Dental Success Network are Flex and Modento. Both of these softwares are very highly rated, and here are many of the problems they solve:

- Online Forms
- Digital consent forms
- Reminders and Confirmations, text or email
- Online Scheduling
---
# Online Bill-pay, text or email-to-pay features

# Treatment plan presentation

No matter which of the two softwares you use above, we know you will be happy: And although we could get into a detailed description of the companies and their advantages and disadvantages, we know that by the time you read this book; any comparison of features will be obsolete due to the speed of innovation.

# Imaging

We have used both Apteryx XVWeb and XDR for radiology and intraoral photography needs. Check both of these options out- however they differ significantly now: Apteryx XVWeb is now completely cloud-based, as the company has sunsetted their server-based version. XDR is still server based and does not take up any internet bandwidth.

The reason that these two are the chosen ones is that they also work well with many different kinds of sensors from the Dexis to Schick. You never know what is going to be the best technology the next time you need to buy a sensor; so having the ability to buy any brand is very nice.

# Insurance Verification

Sometimes we need extra help at the front; and during a startup this is especially true. If you have front desk people who are already feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work they need to do, we suggest you try a few of these insurance verification vendors. We have used Verrific. Verrific, and its forthcoming Veriffic Plus, has the leg up at the time of this book due to the fact that it integrates with OpenDental. To get an insurance breakdown on a patient; the staff member presses a button, sends it out; and then within a day or two it comes back in a fully uploadable file that will give a ton of information about the patient and their insurance benefits.

# Phones

Phones are the easiest decision you'll need to make. Mango Voice is the overwhelming favorite inside the Dental Success Network, and we agree. For phones, you'll be able to buy a phone line and phones for about $25/phone/month: Usually when you pay for a full year upfront; you will get all the phones for free. Built into the software is the ability to have a digital fax line, whereby faxes get treated like emails for both incoming and outgoing:

Mango has a few nice features that make it great for the typical startup dental office. They can give you a phone number many months before your start date. We highly recommend this, and then have this number forwarded to the 'Mango Go' app on your phone. As you work together to set up the office, you can have the office number forwarded to your phone so you will never miss another insurance call, potential employee, or the coveted new patient:

Another nice feature about Mango is the ability to have all calls recorded for quality assurance purposes: However; it does not stop there. If you use Modento or Flex, you can seamlessly
---
add in to OpenDental all the logs of texts and phone calls that occurred. It will show up in the account portion of OpenDental, so you can always see if a patient called the office, as well as the duration of the call. Then, if you want to actually see what was said on the call, you can go to the Mango Web Platform to listen to a recording: All recordings are saved for 12 months as a standard timeframe.

# Analytics

There are a few analytics platforms that we like and have used over the years. There is the largest in the industry; Dental Intelligence. This company; usually called by their shortened name of Dental Intel, has been around the longest and has an active web-based dashboard. They have a few nice tools to use, and they have a large following of users, however the $39/month fee is prohibitive.

The choice we usually go with for a startup, and even for all the clinics we own currently; is Divergent Dental: True to its name, Divergent goes in a different direction and does not have a web platform: They only send out executive-style reports each morning; night; week-end and month-end. These reports are emailed to whomever you want, and they are a super succinct way to look at the practice from the analytical perspective. For less than $200 a month; this software is a no brainer; but might not be needed until month 3 or 4.

# Summary of all Softwares

In all, this is the 'stack' of softwares we have used and see as the most popular options in Dental Success Network:

1. OpenDental
2. Flex or Modento
3. Apteryx or XDR
4. Mango Phones
5. Divergent Dental Analytics

If there was possibly one more software that is quite popular; that would be Gusto for payroll and HR needs. They are an extremely simple platform that can help you manage payroll; onboarding; and the HR needs of the normal small business: We highly recommend checking them out for payroll needs, as they continually add functions and services on an almost monthly basis.

As a new practice, you have the opportunity to choose whatever softwares and hardware you want to go with, but remember that reinventing the wheel can sometimes be costly and time consuming: Following what many other experts have done is going to be the best route for success and ease. We hope the notes in this chapter have helped find some efficiencies and save you time and money as you move forward:

# Chapter

# Marketing and Branding

When you're starting from scratch, it can be a gut-wrenching experience trying to get the right message out to the community where you are new and have no status yet. When you open the doors, the goal is to have a flock of patients waiting to enter; but oftentimes that's not quite the case. So how do we bridge the gap between newcomers that have no street credibility, and becoming the go-to place for new patients?

While there's the thought that patients will refer other patients, the math does not work when you start out with zero patients! So, marketing and branding are your only options to start getting the word out about your new practice. While many people think that marketing is all about 'advertising', it is not. Advertising would be considered the buying of ad space in different mediums like radio, billboards, and mailers. This is part of the plan, but not all-encompassing: Marketing is more wide-ranging and encircles all of your activities from the physical space you have, to your communication methods with patients, to your advertising; to your patient experience, and finally through your patient follow-up.

However, all of your marketing activities are based around your brand. The brand is the one thing that corporate dentistry knows well, and they spend obscene amounts of money on a brand which will get ingrained into the brain of many patients. They spend hundreds of millions of dollars across the industry on web-advertising, Nascar sponsorships, and TV ads just to get their brand across. So if they're spending that much, how do we, the newcomer, compete with that? Quite simply, good planning and executing on platforms where they are weak; but you can be strong:

Remember that Dental Success Network has a 4 Hour Marketing Course taught by Dr. Addison Killeen and DSN Faculty Member Ryan Gross, the CEO of myCMOshare. This course is a good synopsis of all the marketing techniques and expands on a lot of the information found in this chapter: Use the QR Code Here to jump to the course:

# Brand

Your brand is something that will be with you for a long time, so as you start to come to decisions on names and branding, you'Il need to consider the entire package. You need to remember what makes you different from all other offices in town, going back to the vision part of this book. You will want to market an experience, and make sure that your brand follows that train-of-thought into your branding: Decide what you want the feel of your office to be and create your brand from there. Also remember to stick with your branding throughout the entire process. This includes the logo colors chosen at the beginning of the process all the way through colors chosen to paint the walls of the practice. Be deliberate to make sure your practice interior matches the brand and experience you're going to be putting out into the world. As you start to create this, constantly be asking yourself; "What is my story?"

Now a brand is much more than a logo, but the logo is where it starts and where it can make a huge difference in the ease of spreading the message. As you are choosing this logo, you'Il want to consider how it will appear in a few different settings:

- Billboard appearance
- Printing appearance (shirts) - keep it simple
- Stitching appearance on shirts
- Embroidery can be difficult if logo is too complicated
- Make sure the colors you pick match the feel/brand
- Choose clean colors with no gradient
- Pick a logo that is easily definable
- Draw familiarity from local landmarks

As you are going through the design process with a logo, you'Il want to lean on expert help throughout the process: In the past; we have used 99designs or logocontest.com to help us come up with a bunch of ideas, but in the end we then take those ideas to a trusted graphic designer who can then help us through the process: The graphic designer will go through what colors mean, how they interact with each other; and address all of the issues discussed above.

One thing that you will want to give direction from the start is the major colors that are in the logo. Here's a quick rundown of colors and large words that they are usually associated with.
---
# Color Associations

|RED|ORANGE|PURPLE|BLUE|GREEN|BLACK|WHITE|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EXCITEMENT|SUCCESS|ROYALTY|DEPENDABLE|WEALTH|POWER|PURITY|
|POWER|FRIENDLINESS|IMAGINATIVE|TRUST|GROWTH|DOMINANCE|EFFICIENCY|
|ENERGY|COURAGE|CREATIVE|INTELLIGENCE|TRANQUILITY|LUXURY|SAFETY|
|ATTENTION|HAPPINESS|AUTHENTICITY|SECURITY|NATURE|PROTECTION|INNOCENCE|
|STRENGTH|CONFIDENCE|LUXURY|COMMUNICATION|SECURITY|SOPHISTICATION|CLEANLINESS|
|PASSION|CHANGE|EXTRAVAGANCE|CALMING|HARMONY|INTELLIGENCE|CLARITY|

# Branding Considerations

As you are picking some of the major colors and design features, you will also want to be checking the competition around you. There's a lot of dentists out there, and to be quite honest; we are not a creative bunch: There's lots of tooth-shaped logos and the chance that even your super creative graphic designer will probably design something that is close to what someone else already has. So, it is important early on in the logo choosing process to grab all the logos and names of the competition and plot those out so that you can maintain a different name and logo. We have seen failures in this when the name is too close to a competitor: We have also seen where the website URL for the new dental practice is similar to a competitor's website, and so then they have to change their name. With the logo, I want to make sure that your colors are what you're happy with, but also different enough from the competition to make sure you're not building up anyone else's brand with your marketing budget.

# Signage Importance

Signage on the outside of the building is important as this is going to be one of the first things they see when they pull up to your new practice. It is important to go the extra mile here and make sure that your signage is reflective of the kind of dentistry you will be doing: Sometimes this is a lighted box, but you could go slightly nicer and have custom cut-out letters that are each individually backlit. Typically a nice building-mounted sign will cost $5,000-9,000, so be prepared to add that into your startup loan package.

# Startup Phase

Once you have your logo and branding set in place, you will then want to start planning how to share your brand with the community: This will include a startup budget; hopefully added into your initial loan package from the bank. This 'startup phase' of marketing will be quite large, however it can be pretty economical if there is not a lot of competition that you're going up against. One of the first things you might be considering is hiring a marketing person or company to help.

# How to Hire a Marketing Company/Person

# Questions to ask

- Have you ever managed social media for a business?
- Walk me through the steps of how you would create an engaging Facebook post?
- Have you ever set up a Facebook ad? Or do you just 'boost' posts?
- When creating a Facebook ad, billboard and/or print ad, what kind of audience do you think you would want those ads to appeal to and how would you achieve that?
- What are the most important skills you have learned that you think would be important for this position?
- Are you more of a detail-oriented person or big picture and why?
- Tell me about a time when you created content for an email and the process you went through to create it?
- How have you measured success in your current/past marketing role?
- Give an example of a goal you had to achieve in a marketing role and what steps you took to achieve it?
- What kind of management style do you prefer?
- What motivates you to work hard and do well?
- Tell me about a project you have worked on that you are most proud of?
- Tell me about a position you've held where you have managed multiple projects, vendors and timelines.
- What do you do to stay organized?
- Do you prefer to do your own graphic design or work with graphic designers to execute projects?
- Tell me about a position where you worked with someone in a creative position and how you directed them to get the results you were looking for:

Our priority is to give patients the best experience they can have when visiting us. What could you do in this position that could help give patients a positive experience?

While we have had both amazing success and tragic failure with marketing people, we generally do see great value in their expertise. We have found the good ones are intimately involved in your decision-making, and they should know you well: The larger the company; the less they might care about your success, and so we enjoy finding smaller companies to work with.

However, whether you hire someone or not, you'll need to keep the process moving along: We also think that if you do it yourself; you can save a lot of money, but only take this route if you think you'll have the time to spend attacking these marketing problems.

# Next step is budgeting

Decide how much to invest in marketing at the beginning, and set a budget:

- Where do you want the money to be spent? (internal or external marketing)
- How are you going to track which methods are effective vs which are not?

Bigger investment = faster results and longevity of patients (reach more ideal patients)
---
One part of the project that we encourage is keeping all your ideas and marketing efforts in a large spreadsheet and making sure that you are remeasuring all your ideas and tracking all of them to make sure you pivot to wherever has the highest return on your investment: The picture aside here shows a table where you can start to track your ideas and see where you will want to spend money over the first few months. This picture here shows all internal and signage spend: In all, sometimes having internal marketing is more effective than external: Already patients will love the experience of a new office with clean surfaces, but to give away a YETI mug or bottle of wine is on an entirely different level. So keep in mind that spending money on patients that are already in the chair can be a very good idea.

As you are spending money out in the community, remember that some, if not all, of your marketing spend is about branding for the first 6 months. While you would love to be able to track each new patient and their source, that may not be possible at first: The money you have allocated during this 'startup phase' is going to be almost completely about branding, and not as much about specific authority-building and procedure specialization.

The 'startup phase' of marketing is going to be considered only the first 3 months, and then after that we switch our philosophy: Remember that during the first 3 months your revenues will be very small, so we need to build up a bank of marketing dollars that most likely come from the bank loan:

# Continued Efforts

Starting in month 4, we will not necessarily shift our marketing techniques, but we will shift how we pay for them: So, in the first 3 months we have a budget; which we will spend in increments over those first few months. At month 4, we will want to shift to using a percentage of revenues to decide our marketing budget for each month going forward.
---
For example, you have a $45,000 marketing budget over the first 3 months which includes initial signage, website creation, as well as a bunch of billboards, radio, mailings, etc. that are all getting executed over months 1, 2, and 3. At month 4, you will want to look at revenues and decide what percentage of revenues you want to allocate to marketing:

In the practices that we've seen do really well, it has always been higher than the normal marketing spend. In our reports, and what we see from clients and high achievers, we typically set a budget of 4.5% for marketing spend. That means that you will take 4.5% of revenues during any given month and that is the marketing budget:

However, 4.5% of a startup's revenues is not sometimes enough to make a difference. So in practices that we coach, we encourage them to go pretty high on marketing at first: This can be sometimes as high as 10%-15% during the months 3-9. After the revenues start to increase greatly; then you start to dial the percentage back as your revenues grow: In everything, the location and market saturation will have a large effect on how aggressive you will need to be in marketing:

Now, this starts to be a lot of money! So, here are a few questions that you will want answers to, and some of the logic we use to help decide.

- How much is internal versus external marketing?
- We usually see a 25% spend internally, and a 75% spend externally: This 25% internal spend is described later in this chapter.
- Where is the best return on investment?
- That is totally dependent on the area and the population you'll be serving: While there's no golden ticket, the baseline for almost all marketing is a website, so you will need to make sure you at least have a website so that if people look for you, they will find your name and phone number.

# Web Presence

Your website and web presence can be some of the best return on investment activity: Put your mind at ease with websites can be costly, but they are probably the single largest referral source for most new practices. As you evaluate a company and or marketing coordinator; use the questionnaire at the end of this chapter: If the company you are using is big in the dental field, make sure to talk to other clients to see their experience. While most of these will be glowing, especially if the company provided them, you'll get a better feel than just trusting their word.
---
# Website

Websites can be extremely different based upon what you need and the branding of the practice, however; the user experience for most websites will need to be quite similar: Here's some notes on websites and traffic patterns on them:

- Create a funnel for website traffic leading to a higher probability of scheduling
- 50% of your website traffic will be the doctor's 'about' page
- Next is financials
- a. Are you in network with their insurance?
- b. Do you have a savings plan for uninsured patients?
- c. Do you offer payment plans for larger treatment plans?
- Show office fees on the website, rarely done; but generates more of an opportunity for scheduling now that the patient knows what to expect. Also establishes trust and shows transparency with potential patients.

# Giving You the Full Picture

# Meet Dr. Addison Killeen DDS

At Capital Dental in Lincoln; we put you at the center of everything we do, which means being as transparent as possible about not only who we are and the services we offer, but also about how our fees are structured. We've listed most of our services with fee structures below. Please note that the price of each procedure could vary from these numbers depending on the need - every patient and every case is different:

# Preventative Care

|Cleaning; Exam; Full Series of X-Rays; Fluoride (D0150)|$395|
|---|---|
|Emergency Exam|$93|
|Deep Cleaning (D4341)|$302|

Certain PPO plans may cover 100%.

# The Personal Side

Dr. Killeen and his wife Rachel have two young boys who keep them busy! One son just starting school and the other is just learning to use the potty. Of course, both boys are huge Husker fans. In fact, his oldest son wants to be either quarterback Adrian Martinez or point guard James Palmer when he grows up. When he is not seeing patients, Dr. Killeen can be found on a desolate gravel road riding his bike with his friendly team, Lincoln Aprahams. His goal is to improve his time in the Dirty Kanza 200, a 200-mile dirt and gravel race.

# Fun Facts

- Favorite Board Game: Settlers of Catan
- Favorite Activity: Riding his bike
- Favorite Food: Chocolate ice cream bacon

Once you have a website up and going, you'll need to evaluate where your website is performing well, and where you are not. A few questions to ask yourself:

- Where is the traffic coming from?
- What is the bounce rate?
- What are the highest visited pages on the website?
- Is the traffic a result of phone calls leading to website visits or vice versa?

Phone calls require a 95% or higher answer rate, remember that missed calls equals missed opportunities to schedule.
---
One often-missed opportunity with most practices is leaving out online scheduling: We have seen that online scheduling options on a dentist's website results in not only more new patients, but Google and other search engines also rank it higher because it knows that your website will probably help people more than someone without online scheduling:

# Facebook

Most target demographics for dental offices focus on the female 25-45 age range. This is also one of the largest demographics of the Facebook platform, so it is a good idea to have Facebook be a large part of your initial marketing plan:

Remember to establish an organic presence on Facebook, creating connections with the doctor routinely almost every week. Keep many of them just posts, but then try to boost a post every once in a while; and then do Facebook Ads as well (Ads, not Boosted Posts).

Remember that Facebook does not generate new patients instantly: What Facebook allows you to do is build a connection with a potential patient; and then you can capitalize on that to focus a patient to your website, whereby then they will schedule.

Facebook 'Reach' is by far the most important statistic to watch, and you can track this yourself in a spreadsheet or just check the Facebook statistics every so often.

# Google Business Profile formerly GoogleMyBusiness

Google is of course the largest platform in the world to either generate patients for you, or possibly make you invisible to the world. In this case, you'll want to use every tool they offer to make sure you can be seen by as many people as possible. Creating and maintaining a Google Business Profile page is vitally important.

The most important piece is to make sure you are getting lots of 5-star Google Reviews: These reviews are typically what can move a new practice into the top ranking on Google without years and years of SEO and website history: So, make sure one of your top goals of the practice is to get a lot of Google Reviews, preferably 4 or 5 stars!

Next up is actually utilizing parts of the Google page that go unused by many dentists. This includes the 'Products' page as well as any other links that you can input into the page. While dentists do not sell 'products' as a major part of our business, we do dentures, implants and many other things that people are looking for: In this case, make sure your page has pictures, links, and relative prices for many different types of procedures to make sure that Google ranks your website higher:

# Internal Marketing

Like we said earlier; internal marketing can be a game changer in terms of gaining new patient referrals and creating that amazing patient experience. Once we create a good patient experience, we hope that they will then leave Google Reviews for us that are positive and we practice building:

# So, what strategies can we employ in internal marketing to help create a good patient experience?

Well, it starts with systems like the phone scripts, the new patient tour; developing connections with patients in the office, and reducing discomfort (sedation or painless injections). However; it also includes some things we might not typically include in marketing:

# Patient Experience must be amazing

Obviously you must have a great patient experience from beginning to end. A lot of that starts from becoming human. Go with real personal interaction, CARE about your patients, and just work on connecting with people at a deeper level. If you do that; no matter how you execute it; you will generate patients who think you are amazing: and that's where it starts.

# Scripts for phone work to develop

There are only a few categories where most callers fall into. Scripts that follow all those should be in your operations manual:

# Transfer of Trust scripts

In each section of the patient experience, you should have a transfer of trust: This should be a script where you edify who you’re handing off to. This should also be in your operations manual:

# Texting/Voicemails after difficult procedures (Implants, Endo, Extractions, Sedation)

After a difficult procedure, the doctor or staff should text or call patients who had a particularly difficult procedure. This means a lot to patients and is highly recommended. If you don't want patients to have your direct cell phone number; you can always get a Google phone # to use for patient-only contact. Some services do this automatically like Modento.

# Continuity of Brand In-Office

# Internal Office Paperwork

Brochures and items that are custom branded do your office. These could include brochures on extractions, implants, sleep apnea, caries risk, periodontal risk: Examples are shown:

|Benefits of Dental Implants|Benefits of Dental Implants|
|---|
|IMPLANT TYPES|YOUR Doctor Notes|
|Single-Tooth Implant|Missing tooth $ fcols|
|Implant-Supported Denture|Supported dentuli Ucola'|
|Implant-Supported Bridge|Option at|

# Business Cards

# Reappointment Cards

Custom business cards are commonplace nowadays. Remember that the quality of card is directly tied to the quality of perceived care they will receive in your office. Do not go cheap on these, splurge for the higher quality card, higher feel, heavier paper; etc. Also make sure they look amazing and do not have pixelated images or poor quality printing:

# Patient Giveaways:

# Tshirts

In our office we give away t-shirts randomly: We design t-shirts every few months that have neat images on them for the season. They are almost considered a collectible item because of the changing colors and such. Staff love them, and when given out; they are rolled up, tied with a bow, and a business card: (About $6.50 per t-shirt is the cost:) It is more expensive than other options, but they also become walking billboards for you.

# Wine

We go to Trader Joes or other stores and buy cheaper bottles of wine. Usually $3.50 or less per bottle, and then wrap them in a clear plastic bag from Amazon.com, and put a nice sticker on the bottle, and tie up with a bow: Each employee gives out a bottle of wine per day: It's part of their checklist to give one out to anyone they want: Very random, just pick a favorite patient that the staff member connected with.
---
# Steel-insulated Cups

Go to Alibaba.com to purchase, or else use my contact at this company: They are about $4.50 for a 20 Oz. mug that is EXACTLY the same as Hydroflask: (They are prohibited from printing Hydroflask on the bottle)

# Google/Facebook Reviews:

Swell CX software is a must needed addition to get more google reviews. We have tried a few; but we see that Swell does a great job in getting reviews faster than any other texting-solution:

# Giveaways

Buy a YETI Cooler and put somewhere in the office with a sign that each month or two you will give it away to someone who writes a google review:

YETO

# Email Batching to patients

Pull all emails from the past 6 months, send them emails (Usually 40-50 a day to not get into a spam-mode on the account and locked): These emails should thank them for being a patient, and remind them how important google reviews are to your business:

# Cards to Patients

# New Patients

Custom printed cards with a generic message where you can write any message. Must be high quality card-stock

Hello, Friend
---
Dear (patient),

Thank you so much for referring a friend to our clinic recently: It means a lot that you trust us with your care, and in turn tell other people about US. We appreciate it and want you to grab a coffee or smoothie on us today: Enjoy the gift card!

Thanks,
Dr Killeen, Chapek; and Team

# Special Occasions

Same card as above, but the idea is that when something is happening in a patient's life, have the staff write a 'Hello, Friend' card. The idea is that it just says "Hello, We're thinking of you". It could be a difficult time, it could be a celebration: Anything - people like getting a card. And if it's from their dentist or hygienist: it's that much more special. No gift in this card, just a message.

Overall, these internal strategies might seem like overkill for the typical general dental practice. However; we have seen that these strategies create an amazing patient experience that is difficult for other practices to replicate. When you focus this much on the internal experience, it will pay off in a very high number of patient referrals, and you'll have a bunch of patients who become raving fans of going to the dentist.

# External Marketing

External marketing avenues can be lucrative for new patients, and sometimes it can be a complete dud. Finding out which type of marketing is the most lucrative and which is the dud can take time and lots of mistakes. We have found many of them that are mistakes, but in each area, patients are quite different in how they respond. Finding what's best for your area might take some experimentation as well as time.

Here's a few of the things we have tried in the past; in a somewhat hierarchy of importance:

# Google Ads

While we do not like spending a ton of money on Google Ads, we do think they are important as a piece of the marketing spend.

# Facebook Ads

These are great for low-cost marketing spend to generate more awareness about the practice. However; we also do not typically spend more than $300 a month on Facebook ads per practice.

# Postcards

Postcards can be super successful marketing in some demographics. If they are successful during the first few times, then you should try it a total of 5 to 6 times, and then send them out every 2 to 3 months: People who are 20-55 surprisingly respond well to postcards.
---
# Billboards

One of the last recommendations for marketing; but they can work well: Typical Radio cost is $600-4,000 a month depending on the traffic and size of your market: Typically we have not seen great return on investment for radio.

# Guerrilla

Creative and unconventional marketing strategies that cost very little. They sometimes work well; but can be hard to measure.

# Tracking Return on Investment

Marketing your new dental practice. The most important piece we can impart to you as you start is that each avenue of marketing should be measured and weighed against each other: To do that you will need to keep track of your spending, and where each of your marketing tracks is generating the most new patients.

Part of that is your website and phone number: We do encourage that some marketing pieces have their own phone number: Using these different phone numbers means that you can track exactly where each new patient is coming from. However; sometimes this strategy goes overboard and you have 25 different phone numbers and patients get confused: So, in this way, remember the 'kiss' principle and keep it simple.

If you have only a few phone numbers, sometimes then you will need to just ask patients where they heard about you: Most practice management softwares will have a place for you to put exactly where the patient was referred from, so make sure you ask those questions in person, or in the office paperwork. Get a good handle on where patients say they saw you, and then you can track the return for each of your marketing techniques a lot easier.

Another way to track return on investment is trying to delineate if certain patients are worth more than others. For example, if you are marketing for 'All on X' procedures, these patients are worth much more than the typical cleaning patient, and so measuring what sort of production each of these patients is completing is also important.

# Here is one of the charts we use in our marketing evaluation:

In general, we see that more users to a website generally means more new patients, and then trailing is more production.

# Revenues

When you see a graph like the one above, you'll know that things are going well for a practice, as web visits are begetting production. All lines are moving in a positive direction.

|Web Visits|Production|New Patients|
|---|---|---|
|2020|2021|2021|
|2021|2021|May '21|

Some marketers like to just measure their marketing leads, and to see if they're generating new patients for you, at least from their end. These next reports are quite different: The first one here is a market research type graph of your website total traffic from search websites versus those of your competition: This is compiled by our website firm, and they do this analytics dump each month that is then sent in email form to us. While some return on investment is measured whether you are in the top 3 on any given search term, it can be misleading: Many people are, of course, searching 'dentist' and then city and state. However, the cumulative addition of all other dental search terms dwarfs this number. If you are only focused on being the #1 dentist if someone searches 'dentist san antonio tx', then you are actually missing out on tons of other leads that might be useful.

Through a strategy where you attack many keywords at the same time, you can actually get more web traffic across many different search terms, rather than having all your SEO focus on just one type of search.

In all, marketing is surely going to be the thing that skyrockets your business to new heights after you open your doors: Even before your doors, you will want to have people know your name and be talking about your clinic. To do this, it will take a mixture of brand, external marketing, internal marketing, and tracking the return on investment that you're getting from each of these routes.

# Systemization and Supplies from the Start

When you start up a practice, there is a certain beauty in the fact that you get a clean slate to begin with: There are no bad habits to fix, no systems that are broken yet. You get to design everything the way you want it; and design systems that are great from the start. While this is nice, it's also a daunting task because systems are hard to build from scratch unless you know exactly what you want them to look like.

Sometimes you also have to have worked in poorly systemized practices to know what you want in a good practice. These are the practices where the staff does not know what the doctor wants. The staff does not know what to expect of each other: Stress and hecticness follows when there is no foundation to run on.

With this in mind, we want to outline exactly what you should be looking at for systemization in your practice from the beginning: While we cannot go into extreme detail on each point; we will quickly give some highlights and point you to the resources where you can then grab example documents for helping you finish the rest of the systemization process.

# Prioritizing your systemization

Next is a list of the major categories of the Elite Practice Blueprint taught by the Dental Success Institute. The entire blueprint is the list of systems you will need in your practice. Thankfully, there is a hierarchy of needs from the first day: So we will help walk you through those needs and give you some example documents here. If you have been reading and working through this book in order; you will have already hit on a few major points and have a jumpstart on the process.

# Foundation

The First is Foundation: In this part of the process, you will need to clearly find these three things:

# Mission Statement

This is what your company actually does. It should be short and easy to memorize. A lot of companies get this wrong and end up using big fancy words that don't tell us anything: Your mission statement should also be specific enough that people understand what you do and how it may differ from your competitors. For example:

- Public Broadcasting System (PBS): To create content that educates, informs and inspires.
- Google: To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
- Make-A-Wish: We grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy.

# Vision Statement

This is what your company aspires to be; which can be much different than what a company is (mission statement): When done right, your vision statement can and should help drive decisions and goals in your company. Sometimes it is best to think about a 10 year goal, and actually put numbers into the vision statement to understand the vision more clearly:

Here are some examples of some good vision statements:

- Ford: To become the world's leading Consumer Company for automotive products and services.
- Avon: To be the company that best understands and satisfies the product, service and self-fulfillment needs of women globally.

# Core Values

Core values are what support the vision, shape the culture, and reflect what your company values. They are your company's principles, beliefs, or philosophy of values. Try limiting your core values to 3 to 7. Once you get beyond this it's hard for your employees to remember: Remember to keep them simple, and make sure these core values are used in your recruitment process, your on-boarding process, and accountability agreements. Here's a list of examples:

- Have each other's backs
- Demonstrate passion
- Bring high energy

There are two books that really help define these areas: Traction by Gino Wickman and Start with Why by Simon Sinek. After you have these, it is much easier to go through the rest of the process, and to hire, fire, and make decisions in the practice.
---
# Operations Manual and Systemization

After you have the foundation, the next thing you will want to get a handle on is the Operational Systemization and creating an Operations Manual: This document book is the real 'alien abduction manual' for each position in the practice. It is to be created so that if an alien abducted your best employee, that someone else could pick up the manual and do their job without the ability to talk to that person. It's the real; "How we do things here" document.

With coaching almost a thousand dentists over the past decade, we have seen a split in the type of dental offices: We have seen some that are staff dependent. They have amazing team members, and their offices survive ok. However; if a staff member is gone, then no one knows how to order supplies, and no one will pick up the slack and do certain jobs. On the other hand, there are practices that are systems dependent: These practices sometimes look odd because there's not a lot of verbal communication. Why is that? Plainly enough it is because everyone knows their duties, knows what other team members' duties are, and what the end goals of the process are. In this way, the practice runs smoothly because everyone is on the same page. If someone is gone on vacation, nothing gets forgotten because there are daily task lists, scripts, and sheets that let others know how to complete a task.

As you build your operations manual, here is a sample table of contents of the things you will want to consider:

- Foundational Principles (Copied from the previous section)
- Organizational Chart
- Protocol Sheets
- Accountability Agreements
- Patient Experience and Phone Scripts
- Monthly Performance Reviews
- Ideal Set-Up Pictures
- Common Area Pictures
- End of Day Protocol
- Downtime Protocol
- Universal Onboarding Documents
- Positional Onboarding

# Organizational Chart

From day one you will want to have an organizational chart. Here are some quick notes on that:

- As CEO you should strive to have the smallest number of people reporting directly to you as possible.
- No more than one person should fill a role, but a person can fill more than one role.
- A person can have more than one direct supervisor from different departments.

(clinical/administration)

To create your own organizational chart, you can go through these steps:

1. List out all positions in your organization
2. Give each employee a title
---
# Designate a lead for each department

Draw out organizational chart according to your practice's internal hierarchy. An example is below:

|Example Dental|Example Dental|Example Dental|
|---|
|CEO/Owner|Dentist|Office Manager|
|Hygiene|Assisting|Front Desk|
|Lead Hygienist|Lead Assistant|Lead Front Desk|
|Hygienist|Assistant|Front Desk|
|Hygienist|Assistant|Front Desk|

# Important Contacts

Marketing Director
Accountant
Banker
Insurance Agent
As you go about the process of doing this yourself, use the software called LucidChart to help you create beautiful flowcharts for this:

# Systemization Jumpstart

Rather than fill hundreds of more pages on systemization, we want you to copy what we have already built. Remember that members of the Dental Success Network get access to the Operations Manual Templates, so head to the website and sign up for a free trial if you want to download some example documents. There are hundreds of pages of documents to help jumpstart your own operations manual:

However, if we were to think about the absolute most impactful documents and systems we've seen in the practice, it is all encompassing in the jumpstart packet. This packet includes daily checklists, patient experience touch-points, and following the dollar exercises. By far the most impactful are the daily checklists. These lists are meant to just be helpful and remind each team member exactly what they should be focusing on during a day:

This can include a morning protocol, down-time protocol, and end of day protocol. If you start these things from Day 1, you will never have to undo bad, learned behaviors.

# Daily Task List

Next is a copy of the Daily Task list for an Assistant; Hygienist, and Front office. These are all created on Google Sheets, and can be copied from the document vault. Use these as the foundation for building your own, and look at other tabs in the document to see what other checklists you could create for your practice.

# Creating a Systemized Practice

Once you have created some daily task lists, then you can continue on with some other parts of creating a systemized practice. The flowchart below shows some of the biggest things to focus on as you begin your startup journey:

|Organize Systems|QpantoniManual|

# Here's a list of the biggest things to focus on:

# Patient Touch Point Exercise

In this exercise, you will want to follow a patient from their first interaction with your practice, throughout the process, up until they pay and leave with a rescheduled appointment. In general, you will want a rough script for how each interaction will go, with a possible flow chart of how conversations go.

For example, sometimes a patient will call and want an appointment and already trust and know you: This is easy, and the person answering the phone will get them scheduled. However, sometimes the person calling actually wants to know prices and whether you are in network with their:

insurance. In these cases, then you will need to have your receptionist trained to know all those questions:

# In General, here are the following pieces of the patient touch point exercise that you will need to have scripted:

- First phone call
- Reminder phone call
- Greeting when entering practice
- Calling patient back to the operatory
- Patient Tour of the practice upon first visit
- Seating Patient into the Chair; Building rapport
- Handoff from Assistant to Doctor
- Handoff from Doctor to Treatment Coordinator
- Collecting at the end of the appointment
- Rescheduling at the end of the appointment
- Walking out and finishing up appointment

For each of these interactions above, you should practice this script and role-play with team members on how each interaction will go.

# Follow the Dollar Exercise

Similarly for the financial aspect, you will want to do the exercise where you follow a dollar as it goes through your practice. You will need to list in order each time money or payment is discussed, billed, or collected as well as the team member associated with the task. Here's an example sheet you can copy and work through:

# Time Journal Exercise

|CEO/Doctor|TIME JOURNAL|
|---|---|
|For a period of five days,|journal your activities|
|from the time that you|wake up until the time|
|you go to sleep| |
|Highlight in yellow; all of|the activities that can be|
|eliminated or delegated|out for less than $100 (or|
|what you think your hour|is worth)|
|Highlight in blue, all of the|activities that cannot be|
|eliminated or delegated|out for less than $100|
|Definitions: Yellow time-|low value activities, Blue|
|time- high value activities,|White time- Free time|
---
# Team Protocol Sheet

The goal is to replace as much yellow time with white time and blue time.

For a period of three days, have each team member journal their activities from the time that they arrive at work until the time that they leave for the day.

Schedule a meeting with each team member to review their journal. Identify tasks that are continuously repeated throughout the day; redundancies, inefficiencies and overlaps in operations. Name each chunk of tasks (verifying insurance, setting up treatment rooms, etc).

Allot time and give a deadline for each team member to summarize how they perform each chunk of tasks. Schedule a follow-up meeting with each team member and review their summaries and convert them into checklists and protocols (their feedback and authorship is key in this step).

While this is not a complete list of systems, we hope that it at least gets you thinking about the systems that you will need to create and train on. In general, we encourage you to create a framework for these systems before your first day; and often spend about a full day training before ever seeing a patient in the practice. That training can often be considered boring or mundane, but the payoff is huge when patients see that you have a well-run practice.

Remember that inside the Dental Success Network, we have the full Operations Manual available for download. In order to access the file as a member; scan the code here and click the button: Download Ops Manual:

Then the next section continues the journey to better systemization as we look at how to properly hire and onboard team members in the startup scenario. However; before you get team members, you will need to order some supplies and equipment before you start.

# What Supplies are Needed to Start

There are hundreds of ways to go with different equipment from the start, but from our experience, we have found some things that are easy on the budget from the beginning: The key when starting is finding something that works well, so here's our current choices for things that are easy to work with.

# Intraoral Sensors

When looking at Intraoral radiograph sensors, it can be daunting to see all the options on the market. You could decide to go with a size 1 or 2 sensor; or a size 1.5 sensor; which is
---
In our proprietary experience, if you want to use a size 1 and 2 for different uses, then the Apteryx Tuxedo sensor might be the best option. The sensor is small form, rounded edges, and easy on the budget. You can buy them from Apteryx with the Dental Success Network pricing for a steal for under $3,500.

In case you wanted to go with a size 1.5 sensor; then we would suggest looking at Sodium Sensors (www.sodiumdental.com) and buying a refurbished Dexis Platinum sensor: They have different options for quality, Grade, including 'A', 'B', or 'C'. Progressing down the gradient; the lower grades do have imperfections in the image, but overall they are still high quality and might be a good option for a backup sensor: The cost on these usually goes from $2,000-8,900.

|Refurbished Dexis Platinum Sensors|Grade 'A'|(1)| |
|---|---|---|---|
|Grade 'B'|(201)| | |
| | |Grade 'C'|(13)|

The favorite aspect of the Dexis Platinum sensor is that as a universal size of 1.5, you will not need to carry different sizes of holders. One set of sleeves and holders is simpler to manage in the practice.

# CBCT

The standard of care in dentistry is quickly moving towards a Cone-Beam Computed Tomography machine, or CBCT. The market for CBCT machines can be very confusing as you decide what size 'field of view' (FOV) you want; and what definition, or pixel-size, you want. There will be a ton of research you will have to do to come to a good decision for your new practice, but in general, we have two places that are the best choice to look, Renew Digital for refurbished units, and Voxel for new units.

Renew Digital is a company specializing in the refurbishing and re-sale of panoramic and CBCT machines. Check out their website for the most up-to-date inventory; with prices ranging from.
---
S30,000-S70,000 for refurbished machines. They have options for large FOV, in case you are wanting to look at airway; and they have sit or stand models. These usually come with a full PC as well as installation and training: If you are wanting to get the CBCT technology with the lowest initial investment; then this avenue might be the best for you:

# CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED

# CARESTREAM CS 9300

# PREMIUM PANOREX + CONE BEAM

849,995

STARTING AT S44,995

Installation
Training
Warranty

In case you want to go with a new unit, then we suggest using Voxel with the Dental Success Network Discount. While we cannot publish these prices due to the confidential nature of the agreement; we can confidently say that these prices are much lower than the general market: Voxel carries three different models of CBCT, including VaTech, PreXion, and Rayscan:

# Handheld X-Ray Generator

The next piece of equipment needed to round out your radiology needs is an X-ray generator: Sometimes this is built into the wall, but most of the time we suggest doing the handheld X-ray generator to reduce cost and make it easier for team members.

In this market; we suggest two options. First would be to check out the Dental Success Network pricing with Voxel, as there are a couple manufacturers who have amazing pricing through Voxel. The other option is to go with Archer Dental, an online marketplace for new dental equipment: This option shown on the left is the Vector MaxRay: This has been a favorite of DSN users, and the price has held stable at $3,995 over the past few years.

# Vector MaxRay with Free Hygiene HPI

S3,995.00 S5,500.00
---
# Handpieces high speed/slow speed

Handpieces can be an expensive part of the startup equipment; and we suggest that you pick handpieces that are both economical and easily fixable by yourself. With these factors in mind, we suggest the Start 430 SWL. They have been around for many years, and have been the go-to choice for many dentists and dental schools for its easy ability to be repaired cheaply. In many cases, a start-up will need 4-6 handpieces, and these can usually be purchased either new or used. If you are ok going with used to start, they can be purchased on eBay for around $2,000 for a pack of 10 handpieces.

If you need to repair the handpiece turbine and push-button, they can also be purchased on eBay at a fraction of the price of the large distributors. These are typically about $43 each.

To finish out preparing your rooms for handpieces, you will need the couplers for both high speed and slow speed handpieces. These can often cost between $65 and $130, but make sure you know what type to purchase, as there are options for 4, 5, or 6-pin couplers. As you order your chair, you will get to choose how it is manufactured, so match what is on that order:

As you go to purchase your slow speed handpieces, there are 4 different pieces we suggest to purchase. They are:

1. Coupler simple (S65)
2. Motor
3. Straight Nose-cone attachment
4. Contra-angle adapter
5. Contra-angle Slow speed Friction-Grip
6. Contra-angle Slow speed Latch-Grip

The coupler can possibly be the same as the high speed coupler; depending on whether you need a 4, 5, or 6 pin adapter for fiber optic light needs. With headlamps becoming more ubiquitous in today's world, we do not think that handpiece fiber optic light needs are important anymore. If possible, we think you should avoid paying a premium for that part:

Next up you will need the motor: This is called the Titan 3 Low-speed Motor: This is a workhorse, as it can go forward and reverse, and never needs to be lubricated. It comes in both 20,000 and 5,000 RPM models to suit your preference. Most of the time we see the 5,000 RPM as the most popular. The price on these motors is about $250 used, up to $400 new.
---
For denture adjustments and other similar needs, you will need a straight nose cone to fit on the top of the Titan 3 motor: These are often available for less than $50 used, and are virtually never broken.

The contra-angle adapter is the next piece that we suggest you purchase for both sets of heads. This adapter is sometimes $100-$150, and will sometimes need a small amount of lubricant. You will want about 4-6 of these slow speed handpieces as well, virtually the same amount to match your high speed handpiece needs.

The final two parts you will need to finish out your handpiece setup is the friction-grip and latch-grip heads that attach to the contra-angle adapter: Make sure to get the push-button friction-grip type of head, because there are still some chuck-locked handpieces around in the marketplace. In a modern dental office, you will not have time to change burs in that system, so push-button is a must. These pieces individually are usually $50, however they are often sold with the contra-angle already, and so the price will be $150-200 per unit.

One last piece that can possibly be needed is the torque multiplier: This small piece takes the slow speed handpiece and multiplies the torque to avoid stalling out the handpiece. Used they typically cost $30, while new units can cost upwards of $100.

Those handpieces listed above are some of the best and most simple units on the market; and the test of time has shown them to all be worthy of purchase. The number of used and refurbished units on the market also show these types to be durable and fixable when things do break down, which happens no matter what brand or quality you purchase.
---
# Bur blocks and Burs

In our experience, we like to have all our burs as FG (Friction Grip): These small diameter burs can work in both high speed handpieces and slow speed handpieces, but in the slow speed units they spin with less vibration than the latch-grip type. We typically purchase small bur blocks with 27 holes in the 3 x 9 setup seen in the picture. We then have simplified our bur selection down to the most important burs needed for most cases, excluding the special endodontic burs. Below is a picture of our bur setup.

|Black Thick Chamfer|Black Thin Chamfer|Green Chamfer|Green Needle|Green Football| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Gold Carbide|Red Ball|Yellow Flame|Yellow Football| | |
|245 SS|330|256|6|2|Yz|

We leave many open holes in the bur block mostly for ease of use when grabbing and replacing the burs during a procedure. Typically this mix of burs handles 99% of our daily needs, although it can be important to have more burs kept in the office for special occasions:
---
For example, in endodontics we keep these two burs available. They are kept in a separate small bur block that is only brought out during those endodontic procedures:

- Endo Z
- Endo Prep Bur

In general, most of these burs are the 'multiple-use' type that can be sterilized and re-used. However, it can be noted that after a few sterilizations, some carbide burs just do not cut as well. It is recommended to always keep a fresh set of burs available in the operatory to grab as needed if the burs you are using are starting to dull and heat the tooth. We recommend keeping a 330 and 256 burs within reaching distance to switch out when needed.

# Hand Instruments

With the wide range of hand instruments preferred by different dentists and hygienists, it can be dizzying to try to guess what will work best in your practice. With the instruments listed below; this is an example and general guideline with what we have seen:

To start; these are the general packets of instruments we prefer to have on hand:

1. "Basic" Post-Op and Crown Seat (Have 5 Available)
- Mirror
- 2 Air/Water syringe
- Explorer
- Interproximal Carver
- Bite Paper Holder
- 2 Cotton pliers
- Periodontal Probe
- Bite Stick - Tooth Slooth
2. Operative (Have 4 Available)
- Mirrors (2) [doctor and assistant]
- Explorer
- Interproximal Carver
- Small Condenser/Packer
- Large Condenser/Packer
- Ball Burnisher
- Curved Flat or Plastic Instrument
- Amalgam Carver
- Spoon
- Cotton Pliers
- Articulating Paper Forceps
3. Endo (Have at least 2 Available)
- Restorative setup listed above
---
# Endodontic Instruments

- a. Endo pick
- b. Endo plugger
- c. Endo ring sponges
- d. Apex locator hook and file holder
- e. Rubber dam clamp/forceps/frame/dam punch

# Hygiene (Start with 4 setups per hygienist you have)

- a. Mirror
- b. Probe (3-6-9-12)
- c. Air/water syringe
- d. Explorer 11/12
- e. NE128 Anterior Scaler
- f. H6/H7 Anterior Scaler
- g. S2O4SD Posterior Scaler
- h. IUFW204 Posterior Scaler
- i. NEVI

# Extraction Instruments

With the plethora of extraction instruments on the market, it might be difficult to choose the best setup. Even if you are locked into a certain type of 150 forcep, the difference between brands can be significant: In general, we think that 2-3 extraction kits are best for a startup office, and then you will want to keep forceps separately to pull out as needed on a case-by-case basis. Here's our simple extraction kit; but customize as you prefer:

1. Molt 9 Periosteal Elevator
2. Double Ended Curette
3. Molt 2 Curette
4. Bone File
5. Small Straight Elevator
6. Large Straight Elevator
7. Curved Elevator
8. Bard-Parker/Blade of choice
9. Hemostats/Scissors
10. Minnesota Retractor
11. Bite Block (optional)

This kit will be the base kit for every extraction. As forceps are needed for certain teeth, you get them from sterilization. If you're starting out and want the most simple set of forceps, we can suggest the following:

1. 150 Universal Upper Forceps (Purchase 2)
2. 151 Universal Lower Forceps (Purchase 2)
3. Ashe (Bird-beak) Anterior Forceps
4. 23 Lower 'Cowhorn' Forceps
5. 19 Lower Forceps
---
# 6. 53 R & 53 L Upper Forceps

# 7. 88 R & 88 L Upper Forceps

While the list above should get you through most situations, you may have others that you prefer: The biggest thing to be aware of is that some of the 23 and 88 forceps have differing levels of curve to their 'beaks'. Make sure you choose ones that you are familiar with and that work in your hands:

No matter how well you think the extraction is going, root tips always break and then the extraction goes surgical. In these scenarios, you will want to have a few separate packs of instruments. Here's a few more set of instruments to have ready:

1. Surgical scissors and Needle Grabbers (Purchase 2)
2. Root Tip Picks (Usually a set of straight; left, and right angled picks)
3. Flags (East & West Cryers)
4. Potts Elevators (#6, and #7)
5. Tissue Forceps

If you have all these instruments above, you will be able to address most extraction scenarios. While there are many specialized extraction utensils, sometimes the best one is actually the surgical handpiece. With a flap and exposure, a handpiece can get you out of sticky situations. In this regard, the final piece of equipment needed for oral surgery should be a set of surgical burs that can be used to remove bone in those situations.

# Endodontic Instruments

If you are experienced at endodontics, you might already have your preferred set of instruments. These might include the burs listed previously, but you will also need to find the rest of the setup including apex locator; handpiece, and files. Here are some of our current favorites:

|Sybron Endo|Denisoly|Sirona|
|---|---|---|
|1 Endo Ring|This famous blue plastic ring is typically a very cheap expense at around $45, but is the preferred choice for most dentists. We suggest having at least 2-3 of these on hand for busy days of root canals.| |
---
# 2 Apex Locator

While the J Morita brand of Apex Locator is the industry standard, the technology behind apex location is simple and has been repeated widely in other brands and models: Choose according to your own budget and preference. The range of used locators is in the $100-250 range, with new J Morita locators around $950.

# 3 Endo Motor

There are many motors on the market currently; with more in development all the time. In the last few years; we have found two to be our favorites: The one we have used for a couple years now is the Dentsply Sirona X-Smart IQ Cordless Endo Motor: The biggest thing about this system is that it is cordless, but beyond that the name smart actually means quite a bit in this scenario. As you choose your file, the associated iPad (not included in purchase) will show a screen with all your favorite files. You pick which one you are utilizing, and it will automatically change the settings between rotary; reciprocation, torque, speed, and reverse-functionality: Whereas other systems you might have to change these settings manually, this system knows the best settings for each file. You simply touch the picture of the file you want; and it does the rest:

Another option in endo motors is the newer J Morita Tri Auto ZXZ. True to the historical branding, the ZX2 actually includes an apex locator that can be toggled on and off while filing: The cordless factor is almost a must-have these days, but this unit also includes reciprocation in a 180/180 fashion. This allows it to use almost all reciprocation file systems, however the instructions on many WaveOne files will say that they like reciprocation that is 150/90. Use WaveOne files at your own risk but know that some newer studies show equal efficacy even when the file rotation is not the manufacturers recommended 'proprietary' formula.

# 4 File System

Asking dentists their favorite file system is like asking for a favorite flavor of ice cream, everyone likes something different: We believe strongly that anything that works well in your hands is the best to use. However; if you are looking for something to try; we are fans of the WaveOne file system, as well as the WaveOne Gold Glider: In the case where you need to open up the top of the canal, we also like the ProTaper SX: While these files are certainly not cheap, their simplicity and resistance to fracture make it worth it from a clinical perspective.

# Hiring and Onboarding

It is an understatement to say that the job market has been on a roller coaster for the past few years. We have heard from many dentists around the nation that finding qualified employees is now tougher than ever: They are desperate to find anyone who will even come to train to be a part of their team.

With underqualified and untrained people, it can be difficult for them to know everything their job should entail. With this understanding, it now becomes even more clear that great onboarding systems are needed for all positions in the office to have the office run in a systemized fashion.

Starting to put together all these hiring and onboarding documents can be mind-boggling. So in this chapter, we have simplified it down to the largest things we want to focus on. Here's a list of the things that are important to have in the Hiring and Onboarding part of your practice's operations manual:

1. Organizational Chart
2. Job Descriptions
3. Hiring Advertisements
4. Interview Process
5. Onboarding Process
6. Specially for Startups - what are the first positions to hire for?

The organizational chart was addressed previously, so we will not go back and redo any of that. It is important to remember that each place on the chart can only be occupied by one person; however, a person can sit in more than one place. If we were to turn this example into an image, it would be shown to the side here. In essence, your new office manager can also be your 1. Insurance Verification, 2. Scheduler, 3. Biller, and 4. Treatment Coordinator. So, one person can sit in 5 or more seats, but there cannot be two office managers.
---
because we have seen clients try to have two office managers, and it is an outright disaster! So remember; one person, multiple seats. One seat does not equal more than one person.

However; once we have seats defined by name, what do they actually do? To start; you will need to define this very specifically and make sure you and the future employee are on the same page with expectations and duties. This is everything found in the job description, so we will start there.

# Job Description

Quite simply the job description is the list of tasks for the job. If you work in a current office, see what tasks are currently done by employees, and start to come up with a list of those duties. In the job description, try to think about the duties that should be done by a person, including those that are even done very infrequently: Also list out with excessive detail all the duties that are sometimes done incorrectly, because the more detail you can put into the job description the more likely they will do it correctly in the future.

It is sometimes helpful to also picture the 'perfect' employee. Try to list all their qualities, their attitude, and their work ethic. Going through this process of the ideal employee will help you write a better job description that will hopefully scare off applicants who are not a good fit: In this process, you should determine which skills are non-negotiable and which are just a bonus. Make sure to be clear with 'Minimum Requirements' with the non-negotiable attributes.

This job description, however boring it might seem, is also an advertisement for the office. Many people will read only the first few lines, so make sure you write it as if you are selling your office to this person: At the end of this chapter; we will give you examples of the top job descriptions for Dental Assistant, Hygienist, and Front Office Coordinator:

# Hiring Advertisements

When you go to start recruiting for this position, you will need a very attractive advertisement. You will need to switch your hat from administrative to marketing: In marketing this position, you will need to fabricate an advertisement that tells a story, creates a hook, and makes someone want to apply for this job over any others. At the same time, you will also want to sell why even though you are a start-up, that your culture will be amazing and that the applicant will want to work with you as you undertake this journey:

# Here's the big things in the job advertisement:

- Job listing headline
- Position and practice overview
- Responsibilities/expectations
- Job skill requirements
- Compensation

# Interview Process

Once you have a stack of applicants, we can then start running through the system of how to sort and choose between these applicants: Here are the primary steps to the interview process:

1. Phone Interview
2. Skills Testing
3. In-Person Interview
- Reference Check
- Background Check
- Working Interview (In some scenarios)

|Applicant Name|Date|Position Title|Availability|Full Time|Part Time|Desired Salary Range|Experience (Years)|Rank (1-3)|Personality|Attitude|Professionalism|Fluency|Knowledge/Position|Culture Fit|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | | |<1|376|56| | | | |Notes:|
| |158| | | | | | | | | | | | | |

# Phone Interview

The phone interview is the biggest thing that can actually save you time down the road. It's a quick (less than 10 minute) phone call with an applicant that quickly goes over the big points of the job and their history: During the phone interview you will want to know a few things:

1. Do they know the pay range?
2. When could they potentially start?
3. Do they have decent people skills and do you have a good feeling about them?

When going through this process, we like to have a quick phone interview sheet where we jot down notes. The example is shown in the picture, and we also have a sample document that is at the bottom of the page.

Check out the document vault for the phone and in-person interview help sheets.

# Phone Interview

|Name:| | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Reason for wanting to change:| | | | | |
|Energy|1|2|3|4|5| |
| |People Skills|1|2|3|4|5|

Tell me a bit about yourself?

What attracted you to apply for this position?

How would you describe your work style?

What can you tell me that isn't on your resume that is important for me to know about you?

Why are you leaving your job/why are you looking elsewhere?

What questions can I answer for you?

After you have them go through the phone interview, you will want to let them know quickly whether you think they will continue on in the process or not: If they are to continue on, you will want to email them the skills testing link.

# Skills and Personality Testing

As you consider the skills and personality testing, you will have two diverging options. One is the free options, which include websites like 16personalities.com or online DISC assessments. In these assessments, you will get personality testing and a fairly good feel for applicants.
---
However; these aren't super descriptive, and sometimes leave you wanting more information.

On the skills testing side, there are no free tests out there. However; if you are driven enough, you could always write your own skills tests, and then see if applicants can complete the series of odd tasks. For example, you could write down a series of instructions about creating a spreadsheet in Excel, and see if the applicant can do it and email the file back to you: Here's some quick notes on free tests:

As you look at paid resources, there are a couple places. The best one we've used is called HireSelect by the Criteria Corporation: The tests given out by HireSelect are both high in quality and in the range of tests they offer: They can do multiple different types of personality tests that are rated against the job you are hiring for: They can also give skills tests on Word, Excel, Web knowledge, computer literacy, and typing speed: Here's a quick summary of the options you have for paid testing:

# Personality tests

- Criteria Corp (Hire Select)
- Kolbe Index

# Skills Test

# PERSONALITY TEST

# Employee Personality Profile

A personality assessment that measures twelve traits. Scores for each trait are as a percentile ranking; which reflects how a person scored on that trait relative to other test takers. There are no "high" or "low" scores on the EPP; rather, people with certain traits tend to be a better fit for certain jobs. The EPP contains a series of job-specific tasks that assess how good a fit a person's personality is for a given position:

|Traits|Score|
|---|---|
|Achievement| |
|Impulsive| |
|Assertiveness| |
|Deferential|35|
|Competitiveness| |

|Competitiveness Percentile|72|Openness Percentile|57|
|The Competitiveness (CMP) score reflects the need to win, to perform better than others, or to surpass standards of achievement or performance. This individual's CMP score in the 72nd percentile suggests that he or she is likely to value competitiveness, but only in areas that are particularly important to him or her. The Openness scale measures the extent to which an individual is imaginative and creative, as opposed to down to earth and conventional. The Openness score of 57th percentile indicates someone who scored in the middle range in Openness; individuals are generally practical and down to earth. While averse to experimenting, such individuals often prefer conventional approaches and routines. People who score in the middle range are generally able to strike a balance between being detail-oriented and not losing sight of the "big picture."|The Competitiveness (CMP) score reflects the need to win, to perform better than others, or to surpass standards of achievement or performance.

|The Conscientiousness (CON) scale is an indicator of a person's tendencies with respect to being deliberate, self-disciplined, organized, and dependable. This person's score in the 66th percentile suggests he or she is reliable, hard-working, careful, and organized. Individuals with scores in this range tend to be goal-oriented, dependable, and persistent in work settings.

# In-Person Interview

The in-person interview can be stressful and haphazard the first few times you do it, but in everything - systemization works. So here's the big points about an in-person interview that has helped us through the years.

- Ask the person to explain what the position is or entails in their opinion
- Don't ignore gut feeling

# Questions to ask during the interview

- Can you tell us about yourself?
- Explain what drew you to this position.
- Can you give me an example of a time that you made a mistake and how you handled it?
- How comfortable are you in your skills with (position require skill)?
- (Role playing scenarios based on position)

# Examples

- Back office - Have the applicant present a treatment plan like they would a patient and explain financing and insurance coverage
- Front office - Have interviewee check a patient out, schedule next appointment; collect payment; and answer an "incoming phone call"
- Office manager - Have interviewee role play a call with a difficult patient who wants a refund or a situation where they must confront a subordinate about a mistake that was made

# Compensation

- When you left your previous position what was your level of compensation?
- What is your preferred compensation range for this position?
- Do you mind if we contact your previous employer? If no, why not?

Attached in the document vault is the In-Person interview help sheet. Take, customize, and use this sheet as you go through the interview process with applicants. Since most of the time you will not have an office yet; try to do an interview at a coffee shop or other fast-style restaurant.

After the interview process, you will want to check references. While this is mostly a routine exercise, you will sometimes find out interesting things about an applicant that are good or bad. These are usually 5 minute phone calls, and should always be done.

- Always check references
- Call previous employers
---
# Background Check

If they have good references, then the next step is the background check: This step is usually very cheap, but should always be done. The cost is typically $12-25 based upon the number of states they have lived in. It may seem like overkill to do this: However; we have sometimes hired people we wish we would not have, mainly due to their background check:

This is how you approach the background check with potential employees,

"At this point in the process we run background checks on all potential applicants, and will run yours today since you are at the final stages of the interview process. Is there anything I should know about that will come up on the background check?"

With this statement; you will give them an opportunity to explain anything that might be on there, but it's also the way they address this issue. If they come right out and tell you anything, their trustworthiness is higher in our book: We have had times when applicants have not told us anything; and then they were mad because those charges; "should have been erased from my record." That was the end of the hiring process for that applicant:

In some positions you will also want a working interview: This is only applicable after you have an office, but sometimes the working interview can help you see how a potential applicant answers the phone or works with patients. Here are some notes on working interviews:

- For compensation find the range and go towards the lower end for the day
- If hired, can add working interview compensation to first paycheck
- If not hired, have check ready for end of day
- Test direct skills- back office skills, insurance verification skills, phone skills, etc

If they seem like a good match, then you can offer them a position, usually with a written offer letter: If you are using Gusto, this letter is part of the software and can be easily emailed. If not, use the template below:

Hopefully you have built up enough authority with your advertisement and interview process that this applicant will jump at the chance to work with you: In that case, they will get moved onto the next steps of the process- the OnBoarding System.

# Onboarding

The onboarding process in many dental practices is broken. It is a mix of 'follow-the-employee' and watch me do this once. After they watch one of your people a few times, then they are expected to know exactly how you do things and what that looks like.

To overcome these inherent bad habits, you will need to create amazing systems that help onboard an employee with clarity and expectations. Clear expectations are usually very detailed, and driven along a timeline. In our sample documents, we have these laid out in a 30-60-90 format. This specifies what they should be proficient at in 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days: The 30 day list is the most rudimentary: At 60 days, they will know and be proficient in all things of the 30 days list, plus added responsibilities and knowledge applicable for a more seasoned employee. A similar checklist is used for 90 days. At 90 days, they should 'graduate and become a full employee, however; if they cannot complete many of the duties of the 90 day checklist; they are sometimes kept on probation for another 30 days. If they are failing at any of the points, it might be time to consider terminating them so that you can move them to a position where they will succeed.
---
# Onboarding Process Strategies

Throughout the process, you will need to have certain things in place to try to get them to a proficient status: Here's a quick list of strategies we employ to help through the process:

# What does success in this position look like?

- Provide all the resources necessary for success
- Education - Show; tell, do
- Online Videos
- Written Workbooks
- Set benchmarks and deadlines for skills proficiency
- 30, 60, 90 Benchmarks
- Pair with a mentor
- Make sure mentor/mentee are working well together

- Be positive and not always correcting mistakes
- Encourage questions and feedback
- Make sure the new hire is being heard
- Maintain disciplined adherence to the onboarding cadence
- Be present and keep up on progress
- Set Calendar reminders on your calendar to follow up with them

# Onboarding Packet

In the onboarding process, we really like to have everything in a packet that we can give them on their first day: This includes all the legalese packets, but also other checklists, documents, and the 30-60-90 day benchmarks. Below is a list of the things you might want to include in an onboarding packet:

# Universal Onboarding Checklist

# Positional Onboarding

Training should include but is not limited to:

- The Patient touch points and verbiage

- Accountability agreements
- 30-60-90 day expectations
- Weekly benchmarks and check-ins
---

- Positional training 90 days
- Weekly check-ins with trainer/supervisor
- Participation in weekly team growth meetings (lead measures)

We also have a mission and vision for where these rules will take us as we grow: Read this Mission_Vision Core_Values document - there may be a test - so memorizing these is a good idea.

To get a general sense of how we run as an office and how to do a few things around the office, we created a Universal On-Boarding document. Read that HERE. With any job, there's usually a legalese manual: It's boring and filled with a bunch of policies, however it does cover a lot of what it means to be a good employee with our company: So grab a coffee and read that HERE.

For your position as a Dental Assistant; there's a few documents that outline exactly what you will be doing as well as a few videos that will help you understand Open Dental better. Read and watch those below:

- Job Description for Dental Assistant
- Clinical Setups
- OD Video Overview
- OD Clinical Videos

If you have any certifications for your degree or skills, like radiology or coronal polishing, please bring a copy of that on your first day as well.

All our doctors and hygienists run by a general set of guidelines set up by our Doctors: We tried to codify these diagnoses and treatments as much as possible. It's a huge book; and is really just a primer on what and how to do things. It's not required reading but if you ever want to flip through it; you can read it HERE.

Overall we run a different sort of practice. It's based on the first core value of 'Fantastic Guest Experience'. All the systems listed above create a guest experience that is relaxing, well-timed, and smooth. We want every player on the team to be an All-star and we feel these systems get us there.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us, Dr. Killeen at (402) XXX-XXXX or Dr. Chapek at (402) XXX-XXXX.

Thank you again, we look forward to starting this adventure with you!

- Reception, insurance verification, collections, etc.
- Manage any 3rd Party outsourced vendors for front office needs
- New patient phone calls, billing, AR management; insurance verification, etc.
- Helping to hire next positions in the office

These are wide-ranging jobs, but this person is going to be the face of the practice before they meet any clinical staff. They really need to be very skilled at most front office duties, as well as being able to manage 3rd party vendors and multi-task with all the things that come with a startup practice.

The next position to hire is then a dental assistant, or chairside assistant. They will have multiple duties at the beginning; including:

- Managing Supplies
- Ordering New Instruments
- Managing all lab cases
- Assisting and Sterilization
- Possibly helping with all front office duties such as:

As you start, you should try to find an assistant who is comfortable being able to do all the dental assisting things, as well as more front office duties. As you get busier, an assistant who can review treatment plans, go over costs, and collect money will be invaluable for reducing stress on the front office positions. In many of our practices, we have had this as part of the dental assisting position, and it has worked well.

After those two important positions, then you will look to hire a hygienist: Remember that a hygienist is a 'revenue generating' position. While their revenues might not be great to start, they will eventually pay for themselves - even if it is a 1:1 ratio, they will allow you to take care of more dental procedures which is a better use of a dentist's time anyways.

# Chapter 11

# Overhead and Cash Flow

There is no doubt that starting and owning a dental practice is a great long-term financial decision. Over many years the income and tax benefits of owning your own practice are amazing: However; in the first few months, the numbers will look pretty paltry: They always do, even if you have stratospheric growth. Over the first few months you will pick up speed, revenues will increase, and everything starts to look more normalized: To see what these numbers look like, you will need to have a good baseline knowledge of financial reporting and the reports that an accountant will give you:

# Reading Financial Reports

Your accountant will give you three reports each month. The first is called the Balance Sheet. Like its name implies, it balances debt and assets: Here are some notes on the balance sheet for simple reference:

Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)Point in time "snapshot" of financialsShows-What you ownWhat you oweBalance or financial positionYou can have a negative "Net Worth"Should grow (positive) over timeSuccessive statements identify trends

A sample balance is on the following page. In this example, all of the assets are listed at the top: As you start your practice, they will all have a value which is close to the value you purchased them at: Underneath that is the liabilities that you have with any bank: All loans are included in this second portion.

The final number; which doesn't really matter much at almost any point in time, is the net worth: This is the 'intangible' value of the practice at any point in time. This is purely a financial metric, and should really not be used for anything more than pure internal documents. This is not the

# Income Statement (Profit and Loss Statement)

Shows money flow over time

- Month, quarter; year or other
- Indicates taxable income and expense items
- Indicates a profit or loss

Two types:

- Cash - what goes in versus what comes out
- Accrual - what goes in versus expenses that come out later (ex: lab fee)

We think this is a more accurate method for managerial purposes.

# Real world

Shows what 'profit' was made, before the next three items:

- Does not show actual cash in hand
---
Does not show debt payments

Does not show if your bank account balance

So the income statement is the most typical statement that you will want to look at after the end of each month: Typically your accountant or bookkeeper will take about 10-12 days to go through all income and expenses to clean everything up. They should then send you a preliminary statement that you can review: In this review; you will want to review all the expenses to make sure expenses are categorized correctly: Incorrect categories for expenses will make your reports very difficult to read and extract any wisdom.

# The Cash Flow Statement

The most detailed statement; which looks very similar to the Income statement; is the Cash Flow statement: Here are the quick notes on this type of document:

- Cash receipts and disbursements over a time
- Similar to Income Statement and P&L
- All inflows equal all Cash Inflows
- Cash Outflows

|Cash in:|Cash out:|
|---|---|
|Patient Payments|Pay bills|
|Insurance Payments|Pay loans|
|Borrowing|Pay taxes|
|Savings|Personal living expenses|

Cash in must meet or exceed cash out

- Non-payment
- Bounced checks

Shows spending patterns, savings, and investments

# Report by Custom Practice Analytics

Next is a report by Custom Practice Analytics, a company founded by Dental Success Network Faculty member Jake Conway: This is the best visual representation of a cash flow sheet we have seen: It wraps up all expenses, where the money is going, and what is your take-home pay after everything is done. (https://custompracticeanalytics.com/)

Overall; having a good grasp on the financials of the practice from the beginning will be key to long-term success: Even if the numbers do not interest you, there is a huge value on being familiar enough with the numbers to be able to make managerial decisions as you grow:

# Cash flow at the start

As you begin the practice, collections will be slow from the start: Here is a graph showing the start date (vertical line) and the cash flow of the typical startup over the first 6 months:

Typically cash flow is slow during the first few months for a few reasons. The main reason is that you will not have seen many patients and so there just is not much production. However; even if you do produce a lot; collections will lag due to insurances, credit card payments, and possibly slower patient payments if you've allowed any sort of payment plans. Keep in mind that any sort of super low overhead is not going to be possible in the first 6 months.

Of course even though you have slower revenues, there are many expenses that are accruing over the first few months. The graph to the right shows that there are still many fixed and variable costs that happen before you start: When you calculate this out; you will actually lose money in the first few months: This is the reason that we discussed working capital, or line of credit; back in chapter 2.

Once we add in all the expenses and calculate how far 'negative' the bank account will go, we look at the line on the chart to the left. In this chart; you see the first arrow points to the low point. This is the maximum negative number you will most likely see in the process. This is calculated off the Pro Forma spreadsheet that is in the document vault: In the graph shown, this negative amount maxed out at $30,000. The important part of this graph is to make sure that you have a line of credit that is large enough to run this deficit; and maybe even more. I would try to keep a very healthy buffer between your used line of credit and possible maximum limit.
---
You will see as the revenues of the practice catch up after months 3, 4, and 5, that the practice becomes profitable. This profit can then be used to pay back the line of credit, and the line starts to have an upward trend again. By the end of the year in the chart, it shows that the practice has made +$20,000.

# Accounting/Bookkeeping Principles

As you start a possible new relationship with an accountant or bookkeeper as they serve your accounting needs, we want to run through a few big things you should consider: Here are a few of the biggest lessons we have learned the hard way:

First is accrual versus cash accounting basis. We highly recommend accrual because it marks when the expense was incurred, not necessarily when it was paid: Sometimes bills are incurred on a credit card in January, but not paid until February or March: For reporting and management purposes, it is better to run accrual so that you can make accurate decisions on the production and expenses during a particular month.

Another thing we see with most accountants is that they will try to delay reports to later in the month: You should absolutely expect that your income statements, or P&L statements, should be done by the 12th of the month. Of course some accountants also try to do quarterly statements, but this is even worse. We encourage that you should have accurate and timely reports on a monthly cadence.

# Monthly Break Even (MBE)

One of the first things you will want to calculate as expenses start to stabilize at month 2 or 3 is the monthly break even point. This is the addition of all the fixed and average variable expenses, plus any debt service. Debt service would include interest and principal payments made on practice notes, equipment loans, and lines of credit.

# Ideal Numbers

As your revenues and expenses start to level out, you can start to gamify the numbers. We use the term gamify because getting more profitable is a game, similar to golf; where most of the time you just play yourself as you try to get better. Just like golf, there is a 'par' score. These average numbers are the typical numbers we have seen across the industry for high-performing practices. Here's a list of some of the major areas and targeted overhead numbers:

|Variable (low hanging fruit)|Ideal|
|---|---|
|Supplies|5%, Ideal 4.5% or lower|
|Lab|9%, Ideal 7% or lower|
|Combined Supplies/Lab|14%, Ideal 11.5% or lower|
|Marketing|4.5% (depending on the situation)|
|Offices expenses|1.2%|
|Other expenses|5.5%, Ideal 4.5%|
|Merchant fees|200|
---
# Patient refunds

# Continuing education

|Fixed|Payroll|30%|Ideal|25% or lower|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Front/Back office|16%|Ideal|13% or lower| |
|Hygiene|9%|Ideal|8% or lower| |
|Fringe benefits|2.5%|Ideal|2% or lower| |
|Facility/Equipment|9%|Ideal|7% or lower| |
|Rents| | | | |
|Utilities| | | | |
|Equipment repair| | | | |

Knowing and correcting your variable costs will lower your overhead.

Increasing collection and lowering fixed costs leads to lowering your overhead.

Above is the example scorecard from Custom Practice Analytics. This shows the target range expenses for a practice that is trying to get to 60% overhead. Remember the quote from Karl Pearson, "That which is measured, improves. That which is measured and reported, improves exponentially." This is commonly noted as Pearson's Law: To achieve success in your business, you will want to be fanatical about measuring and improving: Scorecards like this, paired with a monthly cadence of analytics, will lead to amazing growth and increased profitability for you.

# When to Grow

As you grow from scratch, you might have questions about when to add more hygiene hours, when to add another assistant, or open up another operatory: Here are some of the most common symptoms we see that means you need to expand:

# When to add more Hygiene Hours

- Hygiene booked out (85%+) for 3+ weeks
- Booking out new patients more than 14 days
- New patient flow is maintaining/increasing
- Recall/Reactivation is happening and having to book out far into the future

# When to add another dental assistant (If the practice can handle it)

- Patient volume in general is increasing
- No overflow time
- Same-day treatment trending down
- New patient flow is throttled

# When to look at adding an associate doctor

- Periodic plus new patient exams exceed 125-130+ per doctor on a consistent basis
- Doctor booking out operative more than 2 weeks

Trying to discuss the entire overhead and financial process in a practice could alone fill a 300+ page book, however we hope that this chapter has been educational about the cash flow at the beginning: Remember that to be a sophisticated business owner; you will need to have a deep understanding of financial reports. You will then need to gamify those reports and work towards improving the profitability of the practice. While the numbers at the beginning will not look good, using the documents and resources in this book will make sure you are prepared for the first few months when you actually do not make any profit: Finally, remember as you grow and the profitability becomes better; that there will be certain triggers when you'll need to grow and expand to further utilize the practice that you have built:

While the numbers are exciting, nothing feels better than opening the practice on the first day and accepting patient #1. The next chapter will address just that, and making sure you start off on the right foot!

# Chapter 12

# First Days and Resources

By the time the first day of your new clinic comes, you will have been dreaming about this moment for possibly years. You will have planned for months: You have gone through hundreds of checklists and come to the time when all your debt actually starts to make a little revenue.

As you approach this day, there are a few strategies that we want to highlight to make everything go smoothly:

# Before the First Day

In the week or two leading up to opening day, you will be receiving many boxes of supplies and equipment. With supplies, we highly recommend you have these tip-out bins ready to go. Visit the website https://simplastics.com/bins-containers/dental to find the exact setup that works well for you. Make sure you get the frame to attach to the wall in the rear; as this will help out greatly.

As you plan out your tip out bins, use the document in the vault for supplies. This has a model of what we have used in the past to plan out our tip out bins.

|Tip Out Bins Guide|Example|
|---|---|
|203|203|
---
After setting up your tip out bins, you will also want to set up the small clear 'tackle boxes' that are used in each operatory to set up supplies. We like the Plano 23730-05 Prolatch Stowaway Deep with Adjustable Dividers, which can be purchased on Amazon. After you purchase them, you can set them up like the image shown:

The clear tip out bins come in all different sizes. One size that is hard to use for most equipment is the smallest; about 2 inches by 2 inches: These are actually great for keeping track of all the burs in the practice. If you like to use bur blocks, you can purchase a 9 x 3 bur block, and then set up the tip-out bins to match the bur blocks directly since the smallest tip-out bins also come in rows of 9.

Again, the spreadsheet in the document vault should be great for helping to plan how your burs are set up. With burs, it is also great to have a large sheet of paper set up with the images of the burs so that any new trainee knows exactly where to place the burs in the block:

# Bur Block Setup

| |10|43|
|---|---|---|
|14 Burs|2| |
| |4| |
| |5| |
| |6| |
| |7| |
| |8| |
| |11| |
| |12| |
| |13| |
| |14| |

As discussed earlier in the book, we also encourage you to have pictures of all the areas of the office in their cleanest and most set-up ways: Shown to the right is a sample picture of what sterilization should look like at the end of the day: There should also be instruction sheets matching with these pictures so that any new team member can know how to set them up either by picture or by list.
---
# Operations Manual Setup

You will want to have the same setup with your operations manual and operatory setups. Each type of setup from fillings to crowns will need to have pictures and a setup list. Go to the Dental Success Network Operations Manual to download examples from other people and see how they have set theirs up.

# Getting Patients in the Door

As you approach your first day with patients, you will want to have a goal of getting at least 100 new patients during the first month. Usually this is a buildup of family, friends and acquaintances, and so you should be ready to accept all these people in the first week. Here's some notes on how we have accomplished this in the past:

- Make sure the website is up 30 days before the launch
- Possibly do an Open House
- Free Pizza at the end of the "Office Tour"
- Mailers to adjacent businesses, neighborhood, and other dentists/specialists in town
- Possible radio station to come do a Live Segment with music

Remember: Include your advertising budget in startup costs, you'll already be spending quite a bit on marketing to get the word out. All of these costs before you open should be a part of the startup financing package.

# First Day of Patients

- Mango phones set to go to cell phone
- Possibly running OpenDental or software off of a laptop
- Capturing patient info on the website before your schedule goes live
- Call and start scheduling them when you can open
- Staff hired 30 days before the open
- Marketing starting at least 15 days before the open

# Training for First Day

As you prepare for your first day; you will want to plan for at least one day of training for your team: This will include all the legally required items, as well as some training: Here's a quick checklist of things you'll want to remember to do:

|Required/Recommended by Law|Operations Best Practices|
|---|---|
|CPR|Scripts for all Phones|
|OSHA|Office Tour|
|HIPAA|Patient Experience|
| |Touchpoints|
---
# Radiology review of all equipment

# Follow the Dollar Touchpoints

# Sterilization Procedures

Remember that the top patient experience touchpoints are the best places to train that have the best impact on your practice. These items are listed below:

- Phone call
- Confirmation text/call
- Greeting at the door
- Transition to the room
- Meeting the doctor
- Treatment presentation
- Checking out
- Reappointment

While training on these again and again can be monotonous, it is by far the best use of time and will have a huge impact on patient experience, patient referrals, and Google Reviews.

# First Week of Patients

After your one day of training, you will then be prepared for the soft opening. Just like in the restaurant business where they have one or two evenings of a planned rush with set meals, you will want to set up the first day to be sort of a trial run: This first day will typically have 4-8 patients, scheduled up until about an hour before the end of the day. At the end of the day, you will want to recap with the team where things went well, where they broke down, and do a quick assessment of what you need to work on before the next day:

The second day, you will want to get closer to full scheduling, but still with a recap meeting at the end. After about the first week or two, you will then want to have a 2-3 hour meeting with a recap of all the items: Follow the IDS protocol of 'identify, discuss, and solve' these problems: Remember that many problems are actually solved by one overarching solution: It could be a communications breakdown, or it could be that insurance plans are not placed into the system yet.

# Slow Feedback Loop

Once you read this, you will not forget it ever (Psychology trick). As you go through the first few months, there will be lots of stress. In our opinion, this is the toughest time in any startup. While you could be doing things 100% correctly, the cash flow, systemization, and new patient flow will not look good. The reason for this is that there is a delay in the feedback loop. Partially due to collections. Partially due to the laws of mathematics. Sometimes you are doing everything correct; and it just does not feel like it is going to turn around:

The biggest thing we can say at this point is, "Stick with the plan". You've been given tons of information throughout this book, so keep referring back to the information here. There are others who have gone in your shoes before you; lean on them:

# Other Resources

Inside the Dental Success Network, there is a room specifically meant for startups, "Starting up Right: Acquisition and Denovo Secrets". You can always go there and either search for posts about a topic, or ask your own question to the faculty and members of that group. Sometimes it is good to have people in your corner and people who have been there, and we are those people.

Sometimes you know you want to do a startup but you just need a little more help. We also have two resources that might help. One is the Dental Startup 30 (WWW.dentalstartup30.com) which is a 30-day startup class taught by us. Scan the QR code to the right for more information:

Also as you traverse this journey, rely on your own physical and mental health. We recommend using the 4 Futures Journal created by co-author Mark Costes and Alastair Macdonald, and edited by co-author Addison Killeen. This is the journal we use every day; and we think it might be of help to you as well: It helps because it has many pages set up just perfectly for the endless to-do lists you will encounter! (TheFourFutures.com)

# Practice Launchpad

The final recommendation we can make is to check out the Practice Launchpad, a private coaching firm dedicated to startups and acquisitions. This group of coaches includes Dr. Taher Dhoon, Dr. Chris Green, and us, your authors. If you are interested in learning more about how we help startups and acquisitions, check out the website WWW.thepracticelaunchpad.com.
