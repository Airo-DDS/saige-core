# How to Use this Manual

As dentists embarking on the journey of practice ownership, we often feel confident in our clinical skills and optimistic about growing as leaders and business owners. However, when it comes to managing the financial side of our practices—particularly anything involving dental insurance—we may be more inclined to rely on trusted team members and hope for the best. For Start-ups, we might not have anyone to rely on! This is the type of resource we could have only dreamed to have at our fingertips when we opened up our practices a number of years ago.

The financial coordinator, sometimes referred to as the revenue cycle manager—or, depending on the practice, an office manager or front office team member—handles essential tasks such as insurance verification, claim submissions, EOB entries, accounts receivable, and more. Whatever title you give to this role, the financial health of your practice will depend largely on the systems and processes used to ensure timely and accurate collection of revenue.

At the time of writing, fee-for-service (FFS) models are increasingly popular, but even FFS practices often assist patients by submitting claims on their behalf. For practices that are more dependent on PPOs, the complexities of insurance management require significant effort. Regardless of the model, patients expect us to maximize their dental benefits, and the insights in this manual are designed to help streamline the revenue cycle management for both FFS and PPO-driven practices (we do not cover Medicaid or HMO plans in detail, though we do touch on Tricare).

Navigating dental insurance can be frustrating, as insurers often make the process so nuanced that it delays or complicates collections. This manual aims to equip dentists with strategies and systems that give you an edge when working with insurance companies. We believe this resource can save your team valuable time and reduce the stress of financial management. You may choose to adopt the methods here as outlined or adapt them to best suit your practice’s software and patient needs.

At the beginning of each chapter, there is a table of contents for the order of systems and documents in the chapter. Many of them will have a short explanation of the purpose behind the resource that follows in the chapter, some will not. For those that do no have an explanation, that is because the resource in the chapter spells out exactly what you need to know.

We hope that manuals like this help save dentists time and headaches and ultimately allow you to run a more systematized and profitable practice. If this example manual speaks to you and this is the sort of thing that gets you excited, then you might really enjoy the private dentist-only community that we’ve.

# Systemization Scorecard

Self-evaluation is a must-have process in the growth and development of any Financial Coordinator or Treatment Coordinator. As we start this journey of systemizing your Financial Coordinator position, we would like you to honestly reflect and use this checklist to help you see where improvement is needed in your entire front office, not just collections. In each section, there are also sub-set checklists to focus on the strategies in that section. Go through this checklist to see how you measure up.

# Foundation

- We have defined our office Confirmation Policy.
- We have defined our office Cancellation Policy.
- We have a dedicated team member for Confirmation Calls.
- We have defined the amount of time for each procedure for each doctor.
- We have defined each doctor's preference for placement of high production and low production throughout the schedule.
- We have decided which systems will be automated/third party. (insurance/confirmations)
- We have defined our Payment Policy.

# Operational Systemization

- We have selected our service providers for all automated/third party systems. (insurance/confirmation)
- We have created the blockouts in our schedule to demonstrate our ideal schedule.
- We have created easy to follow statuses within our dental software to indicate patients confirmation status and location while in the office.
- We have decided which insurances we will be in network with and have started/finished credentialing.
- We have created a system for tracking the ASAP List, Recall List, and Unscheduled List.
- We have an organizational chart of responsibility.
- We have a front office lead who has monthly meetings with an agenda.
- We have a complete job description with task lists for each position within the front office.
- We have created Performance Evaluations/Self Evaluations to be completed monthly.
- We have created End of Day checklists for each team member based on their responsibilities.
- We have created a patient billing cycle.
- We have created a refund cycle for overpayments on patient accounts.

# Lifetime Patient Experience

We have a telephone script and protocol in place for all categories of incoming calls. (Resources)

We have chosen a format for our New Patient Paperwork, Consent Forms, Health History Updates etc.

We have a script for all appointment confirmation calls. (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for all patients entering the doors of the practice (front office). (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for collecting payments when patients present for treatment. (Resources)

We have a timeline defined for insurance verification.

We have a script and protocol for rescheduling patients that must be moved due to conflicts. (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for explaining treatment estimates to patients with insurance. (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for transition to the front office (check-out). (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for checking out and reappointing each patient. (Resources)

We have a script and protocol for sending patients to collections.

We have a protocol for accounts with “Bad Debt” and our office policy on patients returning to the office after being sent to collections or being marked as “Bad Debt”.

# Insurance

We have defined certain codes our office does frequently that we want to specifically call out for our insurance verification.

We have decided how we will verify all insurance plans. (third party or team member)

We hold certain team members accountable for maintaining and reverifying insurance policies.

We have a system for receiving patient paperwork and entering insurance for upcoming appointments.

We hold the team accountable for transferring copies of insurance cards into patient files.

We have created a system for training each team member on how to understand a basic benefits breakdown to facilitate communication to patients about their benefits.

We have a system in place for following up on insurances we were not able to verify, prior to patient appointments.

We have a system for checking remaining benefits for patients with large treatment plans.

We have identified our process for following up on outstanding insurance claims.

We have created a system for sending insurance claims and pre-determinations.

We have created a system for following up on pre-determinations.

We have created a system for training everyone how to read and decipher EOBs and communicate their meaning to patients.
---
# Collections

We have created a group understanding of why our Collection goals matter.

We have created a “payment plan” for large treatment plans.

We have created a Payment Policy for Orthodontic treatment.

We collect pre-payments to hold large appointments that take up significant doctor time.

We work to overcome the biases around large treatment plans, and role play asking for large amounts of money.

We understand that sending patients to collections is part of the process for some patients.

We set daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, collections goals.

After completing the entire checklist, add up all the completed checks and then calculate a percentage score. Put that score below:

Total Items Completed: ____ / 50           Percentage Score: ______

Belt Status: ______________________

Use the chart below to grade yourself:

|Assessment Score| |
|---|---|
|Phase 0 (White Belt)|Less than 40%|
|Phase 1 (Blue Belt)|40% - 60%|
|Phase 2 (Brown Belt)|61% - 79%|
|Phase 3 (Black Belt)|80% - 100%|
---
You might be wondering, “What does Black-Belt mean?” In the Dental Success Network’s lingo, we use the ‘Black Belt’ moniker as the gold standard for what we all hope to achieve. To be a Black-Belt means that a dentist’s practice has an over 80% systemization score and a below 50% overhead number. We find that higher systemization scores lead to many positive effects down-stream including:

- Better collections rates and Higher profitability
- Higher employee engagement and less team turnover
- Higher case acceptance percentages
- Smoother patient experience

As you progress through this book, we hope the resources provided help you create a black-belt level Financial Coordinator. We suggest you use the scorecard as a resource to help you attack each section and get a better systemization score over time in the entire Front Office. Nothing happens overnight, but we are excited to help you get all the value out of this book and become more systemized!

# Chapter 2

# Foundational Principles

For purposes of this book we may use the title Financial Coordinator, Insurance Biller, Revenue Cycle Manager interchangeably. The exact roles and responsibilities that this position/department encompass are carefully laid out in a few places throughout this book: on the checklists provided in this chapter, the list of skills in this chapter and at the beginning of chapter 3 (revenue cycle department list of duties). Additionally we break down how each of these responsibilities are completed step by step. As with any department we recommend having a primary & secondary person assigned to each duty & capable of completing each, this is a great way to save you if you a team member leaves or has a leave of absence for some reason.

Early on in the evolution of your practice one person may be able to run this department, but as you scale and the volume of patients you see increases, it may be necessary for additional team members to help see to it that the many responsibilities are completed at a high level. The size of the department may also depend on the practice’s insurance participation, FFS being less demanding than an office heavy in PPO.

In this chapter we will cover some of the principles of the job, including:

- Job Description
- Department Checklist
- Broken up into DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, ANNUAL and even into beginning, during and end of day tasks.
- Departmental Assessment Form
- Accountability Agreement
- Morning Huddle Prep Sheet
The financial coordinator helps us prep for the days collections, credits, outstanding balances, x-rays needed for insurance, any important notes about a patient's insurance plan such as frequency limitations, billing on seat or prep date, and much more. When our office was smaller our financial coordinator would go over this sheet with us in huddle and then post it in a centrally located spot for our reference throughout the day. In addition, these were in each patient's appointment notes for the day. Now she just puts them in the appointment notes. This process is one of the several steps that help keep our collections percentage at 99%+.
---
# Remote Insurance Coordinator

At our office we ran out of admin space and thus it was helpful to utilize a team member on our payroll (not a 3rd party) to help with various remote tasks such as checking hygiene patient eligibility, completing new patient and last minute insurance verifications and much more. Refer to this document as a reference for the many ways we utilize this very valuable team member.

# Utilizing a 3rd party insurance verification team

Veriffic is a great 3rd party insurance verification platform. They also created another software - VeriSmart. VeriSmart is a new product that uses crowd-sourced information to instantly check as much information as possible about a patient’s insurance. This software has been a game changer, and is quite cheap compared to what it costs to have a full-time employee checking this many benefits. See this tutorial about how to use it.

# 90 Day Onboarding

This sheet is utilized for every position in our practice. It’s purpose is to hold us all accountable to check ins and consistently make progress with training any new team member. As our team grew & before we started utilizing this sheet, it was often hard for leads to track how often and how intentional they’re check-ins and training of new team members was going.

# Skills Sheet

This is a comprehensive list of the various skills that a financial coordinator must have. You will see a few versions of this throughout the manual. You can use this as a checklist to determine where your financial coordinator is on their journey to learning the position. Additionally it is a good reference so you know if your office is doing everything that it needs to from a revenue cycle management standpoint. It has been my experience in coaching dentists that many documents kind of close one eye and ignore, hope and pray that this department is running smoothly, but are really unaware of the actually breadth of responsibilities required to run one of the most important departments in the practice, the one that actually makes sure there is money to pay all of us. You could take these skills and stage them out over a 30-60-90 day training framework.

# Sample Block Schedule

Task switching is dangerous when dealing with important numbers and complex tasks, especially when task switching leads to errors. To avoid errors, this is an example block schedule of a financial coordinator. As your practice scales, you run the risk of burning out this team member through switching tasks all the time and handling too many different items. It can also be overwhelming for the team members because they wear so many hats that they could be unsure of when to work on what. A block schedule allows this person to avoid multitasking, stay on task, accomplish more, be more efficient with their time and feel better about it.

# Lead Meeting Sheet

Our financial coordinator is a lead that is included in every management and leadership meeting because we want to know exactly where our numbers are at. In addition, this
---
A person can provide valuable insight on where our team is missing, x-rays, notes, io’s etc that not only help us get paid faster BUT also cover us from a liability standpoint.

# Growth Project Form

This is a useful framework that all of our leads utilize for projects. We like to separate projects & tasks for our leads. Projects help the individual and our practice grow and evolve. This framework puts some structure around the project, thus allowing us to cover ground faster.

# Chapter 3

# Setting Up an Insurance Department

1. Identify which clearing house you will use
1. What is a clearing house
2. A dental insurance clearinghouse is an intermediary that helps facilitate the processing
of dental insurance claims between dental providers (like dentists) and insurance
companies. It serves as a centralized system that receives, organizes, and forwards
insurance claims, ensuring they are correctly formatted and complete before they are
sent to the insurance carriers.
3. Key Functions of a Dental Insurance Clearinghouse:
1. Electronic Claims Submission: It allows dental offices to submit claims
electronically rather than through paper forms, speeding up the submission
process.
2. Claim Validation: The clearinghouse checks the claims for errors (e.g., incorrect
codes, missing information) and ensures they meet the insurance company’s
requirements before forwarding them. This reduces the likelihood of claims
being rejected.
3. Batch Processing: Instead of sending claims to individual insurance companies
one at a time, dental offices can submit a batch of claims to the clearinghouse,
which then distributes them to the appropriate insurers.
4. Claim Tracking: Dental offices can track the status of claims submitted through
the clearinghouse, helping them monitor which claims have been accepted,
rejected, or processed.
5. Coordination with Multiple Insurers: Dental providers often deal with multiple
insurance companies. A clearinghouse simplifies this process by serving as a
single point of contact for sending claims to various insurers.
6. Reduced Paperwork: By digitizing the claim submission process, clearinghouses
reduce the need for physical paperwork, leading to greater efficiency and fewer
manual errors.
4. Benefits for Dental Practices:
---
# 1. Faster Claims Processing

Claims are processed and delivered to insurers more quickly, often resulting in faster reimbursements.

# i. Fewer Rejections

The clearinghouse helps ensure claims are properly formatted, reducing the chance of errors and rejections.

# ii. Time and Cost Savings

By automating the claim submission process, dental practices save time and money that would otherwise be spent on manual processing and error correction.

# 2. Dental Xchange

Dental Xchange is our preferred clearing house and for purposes of this book the systems we share regarding clearing houses are related to our experience with dental Xchange.

---
# 5. Navigating Dental Xchange

1. a. After you log in
2. b. Select Claim Search

1. i. Attachments is where you customize your settings to flag certain claims & services for specificity
2. ii. ERA - you can access most Delta EOBs if not available on website
4. d. Use the screen capture tool to add X-ray, EOB, perio chart, IO photo
---
# 6. How to enter a Payment / EOB in open dental

1. EOBs and payments can be received in multiple forms
2. Checks - will arrive via snail mail
3. Digital Credit Cards - can arrive via snail mail or Fax (will come to our email inbox)
4. EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) - will go directly deposited to our bank account
- Log in to the Bank of America website, and review transactions from the previous business day(s), write them down according to the date posted.
5. Scan all EOB images and checks, or download from ins website/Dental Exchange, etc
1. ADD EOB DOCUMENT TO PT CHART, IF APPLICABLE
2. If the EOB is for just ONE patient (okay if it’s more than one date of service), add the EOB document to patient’s chart in the Images Module
3. Under EOB_Billing, label as “EOB:xx.xx.xx” with DOS. If patient has dual insurance, add “_primary / secondary / ins company name” as well
4. If the EOB is for more than one patient (even if they’re all in the same family), DO NOT upload the EOB to the patient’s chart images as this cause a potential HIPAA violation.
5. A batch EOB will be added to the claim in another way so that it can be accessed when needed.
6. FIND CLAIM UNDER “ACCOUNTS” MODULE
7. If the EOB is the first payment we are receiving for the DOS, the claim will be marked as “Sent”, and show up in RED, so easy to locate. If the payment is an additional payment per an appeal/correction, the claim will already be marked as “received”, and changed to a brown color.
8. Double click to open the claim
9. UPDATE CLAIM STATUS (for services that have been paid)
10. In the upper left, click the dropdown menu, and change the Claim Status from “Sent” to “Received”
11. Enter the Date Received
1. For a check or digital credit card payment, use today’s date
2. For an EFT, use the date the payment was posted to our Bank of America account (usually 1 or 2 business days prior to today)
12. ENTER PAYMENT AMOUNTS
13. Upper Right section to Enter Payment, select “By Procedure” button
---
1. The list of all procedures will open, showing the Fee amount, billed to insurance, Deductible, Allowed, Ins Paid, and Write Off amounts.
2. Verify that all column totals (billed amount, allowed amount, paid amount, write offs) all match those on the EOB!
3. Once you’ve confirmed that all payment amounts look correct, click “OK” in lower right corner
4. MAKE NOTE OF PATIENT OWED AMOUNT & OTHER IMPORTANT PROCESSING NOTES
5. In the “Reasons Underpaid” section, add a line that says “Pt portion = x”
1. This amount should ideally be what is shown on the EOB (i.e. If Delta EOB shows patient portion is $39 for fluoride, write “pt portion = 39” even though we end up adjusting off $9 as a courtesy for the patient
2. If pt portion differs between the EOB and our treatment plan, you may need to note “Honor TP pt portion = X”
3. If patient maxes out their insurance with this claim, also add a line that says “ANNUAL MAX REACHED”
4. Other notes can be made if needed (i.e. “frequency limitation for exams”, or other remarks you may have already noted when entering payment amounts
5. If the patient has a secondary insurance plan, do not make note of pt portion until all claims has been processed
6. Click “Okay” in lower right corner
1. At this point, you can still go back and make any edits to the claim if needed
7. “FINALIZE” PAYMENT
1. If you are working on a Batch/Bulk payment that includes more than one patient, or multiple DOS for the same patient, repeat steps 4-8 for each individual claim before finalizing the payment
2. Account module will now show a green line for insurance payment on the claim that says “PAYMENT NEEDS TO BE FINALIZED”
3. Once all claims have been entered for a batch, open any one of the included claims and click “+ Batch” button under Finalize Payment, located near the middle of the claim screen.
4. If you are working on a single claim, click the “+This Claim Only” button, located directly underneath the Batch button
5. If all you have been working on is one claim, nothing will differ if you happen to click the “Batch” button instead of “This Claim Only”.
6. BUT, If you have been working on a batch, but you click “This Claim Only”, your payment details will be only for that one specific claim, and will be incorrect as the amounts won’t match, and payment will not attach to any of the other claims.
7. The only time you’d select “This Claim Only” while working on a batch EOB would be to make note of a claim that has NO PAYMENT. In this case you will want to do this in order to still attach the EOB to the claim.
8. ENTER PAYMENT DETAILS
1. “Type”: select payment type from dropdown. Default is Check, can be changed to EFT or Digital Credit Card accordingly
2. “Posting Date”: same rules apply here as with “Received date” for the
---
# claim, but the date will default to today’s date so be sure to change this for EFTs!

1. “EFT Issue Date”: you can leave this blank
2. “Check #”: use the number on the check, EFT or digital credit card, may be noted as “transaction number”. Will be the same number for all claims associated with a bulk payment
3. “Bank-Branch”: the initials of the person posting this payment
4. “Note”: For digital credit cards, you’ll come back and paste the Flex payment transaction number here. Otherwise this section is only needed if there is something out of the ordinary with the receipt of this payment.
5. Confirm that the total payment amount matches that on the check/EFT/Credit Card
6. Sometimes the amount on a check from Metlife will not match the amount on the EOB if any adjustments have been made to an original payment, or it is a secondary claim, etc.
7. If amounts do not match, review to find the discrepancy. Do not finalize a payment that does not have correct amounts
8. Click Okay to confirm payment amount
9. Review the list of patients included on the batch payment
10. Every patient/claim should be included on a separate line
11. Review for a final time that payment amount and other details are accurate

# ATTACH EOB TO CLAIM

1. In the Lower Left corner of the payment screen you’ll see a line that says “EOB is Scanned: No”
2. Click the “Scan EOB” button
3. Import EOB document - you can attach more than one document to the payment if needed. Also, make sure you are attaching the correct EOB if you are working on a batch of multiple EOBs ;)
4. This step is SO important because if a claim is part of a batch payment, this is the only place you’ll be able to come back and reference the EOB.
5. Close the Import Image screen (X in upper right corner)
6. Lower Left screen should now show “EOB is Scanned: Yes”
7. Click Okay

# YOU’RE DONE WITH THIS CLAIM/PAYMENT!*

1. Claim will now reflect as Received (brown instead of red)
2. *Unless you need to make other adjustments to the claim, or post the digital credit card payment via Flex, or send an appeal/additional information to insurance, send a , etc…

# Posting Payments In Open Dental

1. In Account Module
---
1. For services paid for multiple family members with one credit card transaction (for example) make sure to split and allocate payments to correct patient and correct procedures.

# 8. Additional Notes

1. Identify top 10-15 procedure that you want to make up the majority of your income to the practice
1. Think about this and have this established before you start your practice
2. Don’t think about the money/fees at this point. Solely focus on what you want to do
3. Get dental procedure guidebook, highlight the ones you want to do
4. With a billing or coding expert map out these procedures you picked with the proper codes
5. Invest in a coach if you need to, someone who is not emotionally attached to the outcome
1. Saving you from leaving money on the table from the very beginning, from basic mismanagement of information
2. All this will create your insurance profile
3. Establish UCR fees
1. Keep fees to 90th+ percentile for your area
1. You can find this at ndas.com (give national provider for your demographics based on zip code code fees)
2. This will be your negotiation power when it’s time to renegotiation fees
3. Know when you are eligible to negotiate
1. Become friends with your retention specialist
1. They will respond faster if the message comes from the doctor rather than the office manager until you have a solid relationship established
2. Don’t do 10 plans all at once, start slow and build up
3. Having your coding/insurance profile during the negotiation process better prepares you
4. Do you plan on going in-network?
1. Review contracted rates compared to your UCR fee
2. Contract language
1. Thoroughly review this, if they don’t mention a key point, you can appeal it to get a better outcome
2. ADA has free information on how to go in network, they can review the contract language for you and give you recommendations
3. L.E.A.T. clause - least expensive alternative treatment
4. Try to negotiate EVERYTHING!
5. Out of network pitfalls
1. Some will only pay in network rates
2. Patient pays more out of network
3. You can negotiate fees even when you are out of network

Excerpt from The Practice Launchpad Book - compliments of Ben Tunei & Dr. Taher Dhoon

This chapter is meant to provide dentists with answers to some common insurance questions and save you from some extremely costly mistakes. Ben Tuinei is an expert on dental insurance and his company, Veritas Dental Resources, helps dentists with credentialing and fee negotiations. If you’re going through a start-up or acquisition and need help with the credentialing and negotiation process, Ben is your guy. I have never met Ben in person, but when we asked Ben to contribute to the book, he did not hesitate. He is the type of person that is willing to bend over backwards to help make dentistry a better place. Ben took the time to answer some tough questions that many dentists have while going through this process.

We know there are many, but if you could touch on a few, what are the biggest and most costly mistakes dentists make during the insurance credentialing and negotiation process for a startup and acquisition?

The biggest mistake for those purchasing an existing practice is fraudulently billing the seller's information to insurance for treatment the seller is not rendering or supervising. Many buyers do not and may not have the 3 to 6 month lead time to get their credentialing done. So most of the time the buyer and seller agree to terms that would allow the buyer to use the sellers information (tax id, NPI, and license number) to bill insurance to trigger an “in-network” payment. Here’s the problem. This is flat out illegal and is fraud. I recommend giving yourself a lot of lead time to get your credentialing done if possible. If you do not have time to perform your credentialing and negotiations, it’s best to negotiate a transition term for the seller to remain on board to continue treating patients until you get credentialed.

The other alternative is learning how to navigate being out of network temporarily and playing the out of network game until your insurance contracts are approved. Playing the game takes time and training. In short, you will need to be willing to honor discounted fees to keep patient out of pocket to the in-network terms to keep those patients happy. While this is risky for some dental plans, most dental plans will pay you higher out of network anyway to where any breaks you give to patients could be offset.
---
by higher out of network payments. Learning this is critical before a transition and don’t make the mistake in overlooking this as you will likely need to employ a temporary out of network protocol to save face with your newly acquired practice.

As for startups, neglecting to start early on your credentialing and negotiations is also a common mistake. With start ups, you have a lot of lead time to complete renovations or your buildout. Start your credentialing and negotiations as early as possible so that you can hit the ground running when you open by being in-network with the key dental plans you wish to join. But don’t just join all of them. Join the plans that make sense for the area and make sure to negotiate fees PRIOR to sending your credentialing documents.

Insurance credentialing is a long and tricky process, we recommend hiring a professional like Ben to help you navigate these waters. We anticipate the money spent to have this done properly will save you time, money, headaches and help you retain more of your hard earned cash.

# What timeline do you recommend for beginning the insurance credentialing and negotiating process with a startup? Acquisition?

I recommend 6 months for both. If you have never contracted with insurance than the credentialing process could take 6 months with most plans, but up to 8 months with others. Most will approve your credentialing before 6 months but you never know when insurance will mess up. And trust me, they will mess up on your credentialing so give yourself as much lead time as possible.

This is so true, during my start-up, this process took 4 months for some companies 6 months for others, even 8-9 months for a few and the insurance companies and then additional time on top of that because of the mistakes the insurance company made. Tell whoever is doing this for you to make sure they take very good notes and write down the first and last name, extension, email address, time, date and any other pertinent information for every phone call made to the insurance company during the credentialing process. This way you can hold people accountable. It won’t always save you time, but it will give you a leg to stand on when you have to fight them for not doing their job.

# What happens when a dentist thinks they are in network with an insurance company, but are actually still out of network? how could a dentist use this situation to their advantage?

If patients are not complaining, don’t rush into signing up with the plan. Assess whether the insurance payments are paying higher. If they are, then don’t join the plan. Many out of network policies pay to the doctors UCR’s up to a certain percentile. Most of the time, those out of network payments are higher than in-network. So if patients are not complaining and you are getting paid more, leave things as is. On the flip side, if patients are complaining, first address the reason for the complaints. Are they concerned that their EOB’s are indicating you are out of network? Or is it because they are paying higher out of network costs? Whatever it may be, audit a few EOB’s to see if you are getting paid higher than in-network. If the insurance payment is higher, you may be able to limit the patient responsibility to in-network fees. Doing so may give you a higher overall payment than what in network pays anyway. So first address patients' concerns by letting them know that you are going to honor all in-network discounts to them out of pocket and see how that goes. To my knowledge, when you are out of network with a dental plan, any discounts to the patient are not required to be disclosed to the patient’s insurance. My retained attorneys have combed through state and federal laws and couldn’t find statue

---
or federal law requiring non contracted dentists to disclose discounts to insurance. But verify this with your own attorneys in your own state.

Now if benefits are reduced due to you being out of network, then signing up for the plan may be a good idea. What I mean by benefit reduction is annual maximum’s going from $1500 to $750. Restorative coverage going from 80% to 40%. These big changes in benefit reduction often cause problems with doctors losing patients for obvious reasons. Patients simply get the better benefit at in network doctors. So if this is your reality and you are losing a lot of patients then joining the plan may be best to stop the bleeding and help you rebuild the patient base from that particular dental plan.

# When and how often can a dentist renegotiate their fee schedule with insurance companies?

It varies by insurance. Most will allow you to negotiate every 2 years, but pay attention to your fee contracts as they will outline renegotiating terms.

# What resources can a dentist use to set their UCR fees? Should dentists update their fees yearly?

I use Fair Health Consumer. Go to feeestimator.org to purchase UCR percentiles for your area and consider setting your fees at any of the percentiles listed. Most experts recommend the 70th and 80th percentile as listed on Fair Health but to avoid making a statement that could be misconstrued as an attempt to fix fees, I recommend consulting with a professional to help you determine where to set your fees. Also, annual increases are recommended. But carefully consider those annual increases so you don’t price yourself out of the market.

# How do you handle situations where a dentist is in network with an insurance at an associateship and they also desire to be in network with that same insurance at their new office?

When do you inform the insurance company of changed addresses? What if the doctor stays on part time at the associateship how do you make sure checks aren't sent to the wrong office?

If you keep a part time job as a new business owner, let each insurance company know that you want to retain your existing listing at your associateship and your new location. It’s very common for doctors to be contracted with the same insurance at multiple locations. When billing insurance at your new location, make sure you have all your billing information correct. Make sure you bill insurance according to the exact business entity name that’s associated with your tax ID. Do not bill your DBA (doing business as) name. Insurance has to verify your tax ID with the IRS before they can pay you so you need to make sure your W9, and billing set up is correct. If insurance makes a mistake and sends your money to another practice you are contracted with, send a letter to the insurance to notify them that they are committing check fraud (or wire fraud if they do direct deposit) for sending your patients reimbursements to a practice where your patient records do not reside. If insurance sends your EOB’s to another office, let them know that they’ve now violated HIPAA and HITECH. These are federal violations subject to penalties and fines. Ask them to correct their mistake promptly and warn them that if they do not correct their mistake you will report their activity to the department of justice and your state insurance commissioner.

# How many insurance companies do you usually recommend going in network with (we know this is a case by case situation)?

44
---
For an existing practice, I recommend mirroring the sellers list of PPO’s for at least 1 year. After your first anniversary then consider paring back in a few PPO’s and/or consolidating a few PPO’s under umbrella networks to get a higher fee schedule. An example is terminating your Met life contract and moving it to an umbrella network that affiliated with Met Life to get higher fees.

For start ups, PPO participation often helps drive new patient flow. But since each area is unique and different, do some research on the common PPO players in that community by interviewing nearby offices (anonymously) to get their opinion on which networks are the strongest. You can also call a PPO negotiating and credentialing firm to get their feedback as well. Most professional negotiating firms will have access to data that will help steer you to the right plans to join.

For my startup I went in network with 5 plans. One of those plans is an umbrella plan that has about 50 different insurances under it. Refer to Ben’s comments about how you are being reimbursed. We were having trouble getting in network with Met Life, which turned out to be a blessing because Met Life actually reimburses us almost 100% of our UCR for preventive under most group numbers, this led us to stay out of network with Met Life, which was also great because the In-Network Met Life fee schedule we were offered was about 50% or our UCR for most procedure codes.

# In an acquisition, what are some tips for making sure there are not mix-ups with the insurance between the previous owner and new owner?

Tax ID and NPI are often reasons why there is a mixup. For most transitions, doctors only purchase the assets of the practice and introduce their own tax ID to govern the operation. Once a new owner takes over the practice make sure to verify that you are using your own tax id, business name, and set of NPI’s so that billing issues you will experience with insurance are not your fault. When insurance makes mistakes, and believe me they will, you can hold them accountable for any mistakes they make.

# When is it a good idea to consider going in-network with Medicaid?

Rural communities are places where Medicaid can be beneficial as most doctors will not touch Medicaid. Medicaid can be a good practice builder if all other marketing options are not producing great results. But carefully consider the risks. Medicaid is low paying but can be high volume. Many dental practices do well with Medicaid, but sacrifice quality to accommodate high volume. I’m a big believer in focusing on quality care first, but I also understand the challenges of delivering treatment under restrictive policies and reimbursements from Medicaid. To make Medicaid work many make attempts to increase efficiency to see more patients. If there’s a way for you to do that without compromising your quality, go for it! But understand that a successful medicaid office is high volume while successful PPO or FFS offices focus on seeing fewer patients with bigger treatment plans (implants, crowns, bridges...etc).

# A few other thoughts on this topic.

When done properly, medicaid can be a solid option to help patients and cash flow in a practice. Depending on your vision here are a few ideas to consider on medicaid:

1. Don’t offer medicaid appointments every day, pick one or two days a week.
2. Don’t offer medicaid appointments all day long, identify when you are slower, say 10am-2pm, and book these patients in this time range.
3. Consider implementing a 1 strike policy for no-shows / last minute cancellations.
4. Consider not booking their recall appointments, this sounds bad, but the reimbursement from some states won’t even cover your hygienists hourly wage and we recommend your hygienists produce 3.3 times their pay per hour.
5. Have an overflow column that is for medicaid appointments that can help fill holes in your schedule.
---
accept medicaid, but don’t want it to take over their practice. Remember this is a business and you have expensive bills and loans to pay, so do this strategically.

It’s always a good idea to get an up to date ADA code book for your team to reference. Charles Blair also has a great dental coding book that has some great narratives. Also Teresa Duncan has some good resources on dental insurance.

Do you recommend that a doctor bills their UCR fees even for insurances that they are in network with and then make the adjustment in practice management software when the EOB comes back?

Yes I always recommend billing your standard UCR's to insurance. 1) you can claim and take credit for any discounts you give the patient. Don't let insurance take that credit. 2) Billing UCR may trigger higher payments and fee increases from insurance over time. Billing a lower fee (PPO fee) to insurance could send a message to insurance that your fees are set very low. This could cause a fee reduction as insurance is going to have the false perspective that their allowed amounts are the same as what you charge and are thereby going to want to show an actual discount for the patients.

# ABC DENTAL CARE FINANCIAL POLICY

# Assignment and Release

I the undersigned assign directly all insurance benefits to ABC Dental Care, if any, otherwise payable to me for services rendered. I understand that I am financially responsible for all charges whether or not paid by insurance. I hereby authorize the practice to release all information necessary to secure the payment of benefits.

Date: _______________           Signature: ____________________________________________

Signature of patient/parent/legal guardian

# Patient Agreement and Financial Policy

I hereby agree to be responsible for the costs of care provided by ABC Dental Care and/or the dental team for myself or my dependent(s). These include any deductibles and amounts not covered by insurance. I also understand that it is my responsibility to be aware of any limitations, and benefits of my insurance policy. Payment to this office is my responsibility and I am aware that if the insurance company does not reimburse the practice, I am responsible for the total amount(s).

# Payment

We require that payment be rendered on the date of service. We will estimate the amount of copay required from the information that your insurance company provides to us. Please keep in mind that we make every effort that these estimates are accurate, we cannot possibly be correct 100% of the time due to the many clauses and stipulations that are inherent in the individual policies. In other words, every policy is unique, and the estimate is not a contract. In the case that your insurance company pays less than we estimate, you will be responsible for the balance. I understand after 30 days of receipt of a statement from ABC Dental Care, any unpaid balance will incur a 1% per month billing fee. I understand that failure to pay amounts due to this office will result in my account being placed with a collection agency. In the event that my account is further referred to an attorney, I agree to pay all collection and attorney fees.

# Types of payment accepted include

- 3% Cash or Debit Card discount
- All Major Credit Cards (subject to 3% merchant services charge)
- Care Credit (3rd party financing)
- SunBit (3rd party financing)
- Personal Checks are NOT accepted

# Credit Card on File Policy

We strive to provide the highest quality dental care and ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all of our patients. To this end, we have implemented a policy requiring a credit card on file for all patients effective 11/1/2024. We will now start securely collecting a credit card at time of your appointment to streamline payments for copays, deductible, non-covered services, late and no-show fees. We will be notifying families of any balances after insurance payments are received and before we process any transactions. Some insurance plans require deductibles and copayments in amounts not known to you or us at the time of your visit. Much like many other businesses such as a hotel or car rental agency, we now have a similar policy where we ask for a credit card number at the time you check in.

Circumstances when your card would be charged include but are not limited to:

- Any co-payments, deductible and/or co-insurance not collected from you at your visit.
- Missed or canceled appointments without 48-hour notice (per our Broken Appointment Policy)
- Any non-covered services and/or denial or services allocated to patient responsibility
- Any insurance payments sent to the subscriber/patient instead of to our office
- Outstanding balances greater than 90 days

Please note that patient families will still retain the right to dispute a charge or question your insurance policy’s determination of payment.

By signing below you confirm that you have read our financial policy and consent to us drafting the credit card on file to take care of the unpaid balance less than $150. Before ever charging anything to your credit card in case you would like to make another arrangement.

# Appointment Policy

I understand that because appointments are not double-booked, I must provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. For appointments with a doctor
---
Scheduled for 60 minutes or longer, I will be required to make a reservation fee of $100 per hour prior to scheduling the appointment, which will be applied to my out-of-pocket expense for that appointment. This reservation fee is non-refundable. If I do not show up for my appointment or I do not give adequate notice if I am unable to keep my appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited. For all appointments where a reservation fee is not required, a $129 cancellation fee will apply if I do not provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. We understand your lives are busy and as a courtesy to our patients, we reach out via Text, Email and/or Phone to confirm all appointments. It is critical that you respond to confirm your appointment. For any appointments not confirmed 48 business hours prior to your appointment time, we have to assume you are forfeiting that appointment and we will start to open up that valuable time slot to other patients. (FOR EXAMPLE: if your appointment is Monday @ 1pm, you must confirm by Thursday prior @ 1pm.)

# Chapter 4

# Revenue Cycle Management

# Department Overview

As you start to build your department with a specific person, or grow your department between multiple people, there are complexities that are hard to see at first. Before layering in the complex scenarios, we need to build a foundation on fundamentals and easy-to-understand documents. That is where this chapter comes in - these documents will teach you the basics of the revenue cycle and all about the steps needed in the cycle.

# 1. Fundamental of a Dental Office Financial Department

a. This sports-analogy review is from start-to-finish on how a dental office is set up to get in network with appropriate insurances, bill correctly, receive money correctly, and allocate it currently when received. It would be wise for anyone in the department to know this entire ‘playbook’, or at least the flow of it, to understand the importance of why certain points in the process need.

# 2. The Revenue Cycle Management

a. This document lists out the high-level necessary steps to set your office up for success with collections. The speed at which we can collect a dollar from the insurance companies and patients is dependent on paying attention to the details of this process. This is a summary and serves as a great training tool for a new financial coordinator or revenue cycle manager. We go into greater detail throughout the book on each of the steps shared here. A thorough insurance verification helps set our team up for success with same-day treatment, as well as a better patient experience because it allows us to give more accurate estimates to patients. Of course this will never be perfect, but in our experience we can eliminate a lot of errors and inaccurate estimates by obtaining a very thorough breakdown. We like to customize this to procedures that we commonly provide, so you may consider the same if our sheet in this manual happens to be missing any codes that you often bill. Finally, we also know that how that information is entered in open dental is critical for things to work correctly as well. You will see in this book a detailed step by step process for entering insurance breakdowns in OpenDental.
---
recommend you play around with the insurance module in open dental and frequently use their support so you can understand which customizations in this module might help your practice. For example, you can customize things such as composite downgrades to automatically downgrade or automatically not downgrade. This is one area that insurance companies often provide the wrong information on when we call for verifications, so choosing to automatically downgrade in case this is missed during the breakdown would leave you owing the patient money, rather than the patient owing you money. With that said very rarely do patients get mad when we owe them money, some do, and they're usually unreasonable folks. This is why we must always explain that it is the insurance company trying to play tricks on us and we are always on the patient's side, advocating for them.

# 3. Revenue Cycle Department List of Duties

a. Depending on the number of people in your department, your separation of duties list might look like this, or might have more columns as tasks are divided more, or assigned to multiple people to split up.

# 4. Sample Financial Department Time Journal

a. This is an example time journal from a financial coordinator. The time journal exercise is one that we recommend be completed by team leads in each department, at least once per year. We shared this example here as a reference to show you the many hats that this team member has to wear. It can be useful to share with your team as well. The goal is to have a good record of what is being done, and a good exercise to know where items can be consolidated and made more efficient as well.

# 5. Sample Financial Department Team Meeting

# 6. Revenue Cycle Manager Burnout

a. As you scale the demand on the RCM team increases

i. Be prepared and keep communication open with your RCM as to what resources or additional team members they might need to stay on top of the growing demand

ii. The point at which you need to take a team approach to this department is different for every practice because it depends on your insurance participation, variety of procedures provided, number of providers, dollar amount of collections and much more

# The Revenue Cycle Management

1. A thorough verification process properly entered in Open Dental
(Note: Many ways to optimize the OD insurance module)
2. Provide an accurate patient portion estimate
(Note: TC’s watch out for the common trip wires. Missing tooth clause, etc.)
3. A firm collecting policy
4. Submit claims with proper x rays, photos, narratives
- The first time - this decreases rejected claims
(Note: S/RP, buildups, etc)
5. Proper evaluation of EOBs
Why was it denied or not paid as we expected

1. Quickly appeal denials
1. Watch 30+ day outstanding insurance claims
2. Bill patient - Don’t surprise them
1. Average 9 statements before they actually pay

- Need a process for tracking both of the above
6. AR management
Weekly reviewing the accounts w/ balances

(maximum 20% of AR should be patient portion)

|<60 days|Goal 85%|
|---|---|
|61-90 days|Goal 10%|
|>90 days|Goal 5%|
7. End of Day reconciliation process

# Insurance Team Meeting Agenda

- Bailey please send a text to F.O. when done for the day on Fridays
- Added Re-Cement Crown (D2920) to template
- Seeing this service completed in our office much more frequently than ever. It is often (but not always) under basic instead of major
- Review updated Insurance Participation Chart
- Sending x-rays - To Patient/Specialist vs. Exporting to Peachtree
- Assignment on Benefits for Claims - must be correct in BOTH Open Dental AND Dental Exchange
- ex: Delilah WIlliams and Brittany Mantley
- Be on the lookout for vague wording regarding plans that need verified
- Discussed at last Front Office meeting:
- When a pt’s insurance needs to be verified/re-verified/new plan, please use the EXACT WORDS: INS NEEDS VERIFIED
- Ex: Victoria Johnston (appt 11/17) - someone wrote “NEW UHC INS ADDED INTO CHART”. New plan did NOT get verified by April or Bailey because her OLD plan was also UHC. Be sure to say “ins INFO” to clarify that you didn’t actually add the plan to the patient’s account.
- When you verify a patient on the Delta INS website (Delta of CA, GA, PA, TX, etc) “Add to My Patient List” so we can easily pull them and family members up in the future.
- How are we obtaining breakdowns that get added in charts?
- Delta INS website
- Dental Office Toolkit website

# Chapter 5

# Insurance Claims Submission

Submitting claims correctly the first time is of utmost importance to the smooth and effective billing process. When done correctly, it can lead to quick payment. However, when there are issues with how the information is formatted, or incomplete information, this can lead to delays and increased costs to the practice. Below are some of the most important notes and documents around submitting in a correct, and timely, manner.

# 1. Dental Exchange

a. There are many clearinghouse options out there. For purposes of this book we have focused on the one that we are most familiar with.

b. You’ll need to setup a DentalXchange account & they can remote in and go into Open Dental and get you ready to send claims to them.

c. The DentalXchange site is where you finalize claims to be submitted to insurance

- i. Add attachments such as x-rays, narratives, periodontal charting, etc.

d. Customize your “Attachment Rules” as safeguards for optimal claim submissions

- i. Cigna does not pay for buildup and crown on same day - bill out the buildup on prep date, and crown on seat date.
- ii. Tricare Active Duty - include “Dental Readiness Class”.
- iii. Perio patient with new insurance - include SRP history as a narrative.

# 2. Submitting Claims Guidelines

a. The more information we provide to the insurance company during an initial submission, the less likely the chance of a denial. We like to provide a very detailed narrative, high quality intraoral photos, and the proper x-rays documentation for the procedure(s) being submitted for.

# 3. Narratives

a. Having a document with a list of narratives that your front office can copy and paste into the claim submission will save you and the team a lot of time. In addition, you could have the narratives pre-populated in the chart notes and the doc or assistants can click the appropriate one / modify then the front office could copy and paste from chart notes. This helps us be more efficient.

# 4. X-rays Needed for claims

69
---
a. This is a guideline for the types of x-rays that insurance companies will request by type of procedure. As with all things insurance related the rules, regulations & requirements are constantly changing, therefore we recommend your team update protocols & references like this as new information becomes available. We’ve been able to build documents like these by asking questions when claims are denied on EOBs. X-rays requirements can vary by insurance carrier, as a result, we recommend erring on the side of caution and providing more information whenever possible.

# 5. SRP claims success protocol

a. As providers we know that there are 2 parts of the story when it comes to periodontal diagnosis: radiographic & clinical. Often what we are seeing clinically (advanced probe depths, bleeding on probing etc) may not be supported by significant bone loss on a radiograph. In recent years certain insurance carriers are requiring upwards of 5mm pockets to even consider paying for SRPs.

# 6. PreAuths

a. We are not huge advocates of Pre-Auths because often case acceptance is higher when treatment is scheduled/completed closer to treatment presentation. A thorough insurance verification can help us accurately determine what insurance might pay, but due to the many trip wires that insurance companies have in place, it is still just an estimate. Occasionally there are insurance carriers that don’t provide enough information & we have a patient that wants us to have their estimate down to the penny, this would be a scenario where a Pre-Auth would be a good idea. It’s always a good idea to inform the patient that they will receive a Pre-Auth before your office does, therefore, if they’re in a rush that it would be a good idea for them to share that with your office once they receive it, otherwise expect not to hear from you for 4-8 weeks. We recommend a process for following up with any patients that have outstanding Pre-Auths.

# DENTALXCHANGE - (USING A CLEARING HOUSE)

# In Open Dental

- Go to “Manage”
- Review each line to ensure the correct provider is attached. No services should be charged to GDC as the provider. If so then delete the original claim in the patient’s chart in Open Dental. Update treating provider initials and send claim again
- Send “e-claims”
- Click OK.

# Go to Dental Xchange

1. Sign in
2. Click claim search
3. Look for errors, claims needing attachments, rejected claims, etc.
1. Add the recommended attachment using image capture
- For perio charts, X-rays, intraoral photos
2. For Narratives reference chart notes or narrative cheats in Google Drive
3. For SRP Narratives cut and paste Hygienist notes from patients chart starting from “Perio Diagnosis”
4. Read problems or what needs to be attached or corrected.
4. Re-submit claims if necessary or save edits.

# Submitting Claims through Dental Exchange

IF THE CLAIM INDICATES THAT A PRIMARY EOB IS NEEDED

STOP! LEAVE THIS CLAIM ALONE! THE INSURANCE COORDINATOR IS ACTIVELY WORKING ON SUBMITTING THIS SECONDARY CLAIM.

If a claim indicates that x-rays are needed, you MUST send x-rays. Intraoral photos alone cannot be accepted.

This does not mean we don’t ALSO need to send IOs, they just cannot stand alone.

If you cannot find a sufficient recent x-ray to include - ask the doctor for their help.

If you do not know which x-rays and/or photos to send - ask the doctor for their help.

If you don’t know what to include in the narrative - ask the doctor for their help.

If the claim is for implants (D6010, D6057, D6058), bridges, or dentures, please ask the insurance coordinator (Karen) to submit it, or to help you make sure you’ve included everything necessary.

# WHAT TO INCLUDE FOR SPECIFIC PROCEDURES

# Buildups (D2950) and Crowns (D2740)

SEE CIGNA CROWN PROTOCOL!!!

# PRE-OP X-rays and IOs

- Must have a PA (even on posterior teeth) - this is important as it shows whether or not the tooth needs a root canal
- Bitewings (for posterior teeth) - these usually show the extent of decay more accurately than just a PA

Send ALL IOs that we have that were taken before, during, and after treatment

We need to see an IO that shows more than 50% of the tooth was missing before we placed the buildup

# NARRATIVE

- Indicate INITIAL OR REPLACEMENT!
- If there was existing buildup or crown, need date of prior placement & reason for replacing
- Include DX and REASON for treatment
- You can use the templates we have on the Narrative Cheats document, but also look at the chart notes and ask the doctor if there is anything specific that needs to be added, i.e. Cracked Tooth Syndrome
---
# Endo/Root Canal (D3310, D3320, D3330)

PRE-OP XRAY (PA) -- must Include full apices of tooth

POST-OP XRAY (PA) -- Includes full apices of tooth

Must include PA AFTER bite block and any other instruments have been removed so insurance does not think it’s an “in-progress” xray

# Implants (D6010, D6057, D6058)

please ask Ingrid for help

PANO X-RAY

Sometimes we don’t have a pano in XDR, but can obtain a pano screenshot from a CBCT – ask Ingrid for help!

Pre-Op, In-Progress and Final X-rays and IOs

Can be BW/PA/Pano as long as the site of tooth being replaced is visible

If tooth is extracted at our office, include pre- and post-extraction films

MUST KNOW Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?

Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!

# Bridges/Dentures (D6245, D6740, D6075, D5110 /20/30/40…)

ask Ingrid for help

PANO X-RAY

Sometimes we don’t have a pano in XDR, but can obtain a pano screenshot from a CBCT – ask Ingrid for help!

Same xray/IOs needed as for Crowns

Need tooth-by-tooth narrative

Teeth being replaced and reasoning

Include in narrative if it is Initial vs. Replacement

If replacement, include date of previous prosthesis, reason for replacing

Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?

Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!

Expected prognosis for longevity of bridge

# SRP/Scaling and Root Planing (D4341 or D4342)

Be sure we have x-rays (BW & PAs) of all teeth that receive SRP.

FMX (if available)

Individual screenshots of each x-ray for the involved quadrant

Bitewings need to show all the way to the gum line. See if there is a pano to send IN ADDITION if BW do not show gum line. (However, a Pano alone will NOT be accepted by ins)

adjust the contrast using the perio setting, lighten up as needed

IOs can be helpful if x-rays are not strongly indicative of need for SRP, if pt has significant bleeding upon probing, etc

Perio Charting that was done within the last 6 months

Pocket depths should be at least 5mm+

SRP chart notes

# Ortho
---
# Wisdom Teeth Extraction

Must have PANO

# Expected Duration of Treatment

See Ortho Billing protocol especially for CIGNA patients

Obtain pt’s medical insurance info in case we need to bill to it for 3rds

80
---
# INSURANCE REFERENCE GUIDE

First and Foremost: Please Read Appointment Notes & Pop-ups! :)

# Network statuses and participation

- Scheduling Based on Insurance - Chris do we need a link to this?
- Make Sure Patient’s Plan Shows Correct fee schedules
- Category Percentage (Out of Network, no write offs) vs. PPO Percentage (In Network - write offs taken)
- Network Participation Chart - Chris do we need a link to this?
- Be sure to UPDATE FEES in Open Dental before all appointments
- Open Dental - Treat Plan - Click Button for “↻Update Fees”

# X-Rays & IOs

- Billing properly for New Patients
- Read notes re: Eligibility before submitting FMX or BW etc
- Adding tooth numbers to images in XDR
- What Images and Info is Needed Based on Services ( P. 80)
- For BU/Crowns
- Always take PA x-rays (showing apices) and IOs of PRE and POST buildup, as well as crown seat xray
- Endo
- Must take x-ray showing completed endo, image should include apices

# Billing and Submitting Claims

- Indicating Initial vs. Replacement & prior DOS for BU/Crowns in Open Dental
- Cigna Buildup/Crown Protocol
- Buildup gets billed on prep date, Crown gets billed on seat date

# Tricare Active Duty Service Members (ADDP)

- When verifying insurance, need to confirm that patient has “REMOTE” status for dental care, so they are approved to come to our office rather than having to be seen on base
- Dental Readiness Class should be included on all Claims
- This will be 1, 2 or 3. Indicates if pt’s oral health status makes them able to be deployed.
- Must send a PREAUTH for all routine D&P or emergency services, fillings and basic treatment that totals more than $750, or specialty services such as SRP, crowns, implants etc.
- Need the approval and appt control number before services can be rendered, ACN to be added to claim.
- All PreAuths and Appeals should be submitted manually via DART website
- Claims from services rendered can be sent via Open Dental/Dental Exchange
---
# Reviewing Benefit Coverage

What automatically populates in Open Dental’s treatment plan is not always accurate. Plans may pay off different fee schedule (i.e. Delta PPO vs. Premier) that needs to be manually calculated.

- MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE
- Waiting Periods
- Checking to see if a patient has Ortho Coverage
- Frequency Limitations
- Bone Graft - usually not covered, but Open Dental will default coverage under Oral Surgery category. When in doubt, consider 0% coverage from INS.
- Pulp Cap - often not a benefit at all. If it IS covered, it is not when billed with fillings/other restoration. When in doubt, consider 0% coverage from INS.
- Buildup - check insurance plan notes to see if it is covered when billed w/ crown. Some plans (such as Cigna) will only cover if you bill buildup on prep and crown on seat date.

# Patient Balances and Credits

If a patient has a credit on account and wants a Refund, here is what to do:

# Patient Refund Protocol

Then, add Patient to Refund Request Spreadsheet.

82
---
# For Hygienists

# Scaling and Root Planing (SRP)

# X-RAYS

Make sure we have great x-rays to send along with SRP claims. Take BW and/or PAs as needed, even if the pt is not eligible (we can write it off). A pano cannot be submitted with SRP, must be BW and PAs. X-rays may not clearly show perio at first glance, so good IOs can be helpful. (i.e. If a patient has significant bleeding upon probing, etc.) If SRP is denied, we can submit an appeal, annotating x-rays to show spurs, calcium deposits, loss of attachment.

# Perio Charting

Each insurance company has slightly different criteria, but typically patient should have at least 4 or 5mm pockets to qualify for SRP. Be sure that perio charting has been completed.

# Arestin

Sometimes covered, sometimes not - assume no, unless it has been specifically added as a covered service on ins breakdown. Some insurance will require waiting at least 30 days after SRP before administering Arestin.

# Scheduling

# Frequency

Insurance specifications for cleaning frequencies can vary:

- 2 cleanings per calendar year
- 2 cleanings in 12 months
- 1 cleaning every 6 months
- First perio maintenance cannot be sooner than 3 months after SRP

# SRP nuances

- most will only allow 2 quads/day
- Some may even require 7-14 days between sides

Know how to look at/interpret patient’s insurance benefits for these specifications.

# D2950 - Core Build Up & D2740 Crown (EXISTING FILLING/recurrent decay):

Patient presented with large existing filling on tooth #__ and recurrent decay present. Once existing restoration and decay were removed, over half the tooth (50%+) was missing, leaving insufficient structure to support revised fillings or a crown on its own. Core buildup was placed for retention of the crown.

# D2950 - Core Build Up & D2740 Crown (BROKEN TOOTH):

Patient presented with broken tooth #__. Weak tooth and over 50% of the tooth is missing. The remaining structure was insufficient to support fillings or a crown on its own. Core buildup was placed for retention of the crown.

# D2740 - Crown placed over previous filling (NO BUILDUP NEEDED):

Patient presents with a large filling extending more than ⅔ up the buccal and lingual cusps. Recurrent decay present extending over halfway into the dentin. Once recurrent decay was removed, over 50% of the tooth was missing, and the remaining tooth structure cannot support additional/revised fillings, so a crown is warranted to preserve the tooth.

# D2740 - REPLACEMENT OF OLD/BROKEN/MISSING CROWN w/ BUILDUP D2950:

Patient presents with substantial recurrent decay on the distal and lingual aspects of the existing crown on tooth #__ (date of initial crown placement: _____). After removal of crown and existing restorative material and recurrent decay, over 50% of the tooth was missing, and insufficient tooth structure remained to support and maintain the crown, so a core buildup was placed. The old crown was deemed unusable and no longer fit, so a new crown was fabricated. Please see intra oral photos, which may more clearly show the need for treatment than x-rays alone.

# D2740 - REPLACEMENT OF OLD CROWN, NO BUILDUP NEEDED:

Patient presents with substantial recurrent decay on the distal and lingual aspects of the existing crown on tooth #__ (date of initial crown placement: _____). After removal of the crown and existing restorative material and recurrent decay, the old crown no longer fit and was deemed unusable, so a new crown was fabricated. Please see intra oral photos and x-rays.

Due to increased safety measures that are now taken as mandated by the ADA and CDC resulting from COVID-19, we are billing for additional costs associated with purchasing masks, sterilization procedures, and other CDC requirements, per new industry standards.

# SENDING WISDOM TEETH TO MEDICAL PLAN AS PRIMARY:

Upon direction of the patient's dental plan, we are submitting this dental claim to the patient's medical plan to determine if there are benefits provided for sedation and/or oral surgery - removal of impacted wisdom teeth.

Medical Diagnosis code: K.01.1

# CIGNA CLAIMS:

# D2950 CIGNA BUILDUP/CROWN PREP

Patient presented with large existing filling on tooth __ and recurrent decay present. Once existing restoration and decay were removed, over half the tooth (50%+) was missing, leaving insufficient structure to support revised fillings or a crown on its own. Core buildup was placed today (PREP DATE) for retention of the crown. Temporary crown was fitted, and patient will return for delivery of permanent crown in approximately 3 weeks.

# D2740 CIGNA CROWN/SEAT DATE

Patient presents today for DELIVERY OF PERMANENT CROWN #__. Buildup was placed and covered with a temporary crown, which was previously billed out on the PREP DATE: ___.
---
# TRIED AND TRUE APPEAL NARRATIVE TEMPLATES

# ENDO / BUILDUP WITHOUT CROWN - PAY BUILDUP AS FILLING INSTEAD

I am sending an additional letter on behalf of our patient, ___, who was in our office on ___ at which time we completed endodontic therapy (D___) on anterior tooth #_, and then restored the tooth with a buildup (D2950).

We have received payment for the root canal, however payment was denied for the buildup, citing that a buildup will only be paid when submitted along with a crown. Clinically, the tooth was still mostly intact after endo treatment, and only a buildup was required to restore the tooth structurally, and to protect the root canal. No crown was deemed necessary. Therefore we do ask that your reviewing dentist reconsider payment for this service. Since the buildup (D2950) is not payable per plan guidelines, we request payment on the alternate treatment code of an occlusal filling (D2330).

The coding on this claim has been updated to reflect this change. Please pay accordingly. Thank you.

# What X-rays, Images and Info is Needed Based on Services

- Buildup and/or Crown
- PRE-OP X-rays and IOs - always take a preoperative PA even on posterior teeth, as BWs are getting denied as insufficient
- IN PROGRESS IOs to show the extent of decay and need for BU/CRN
- NEED TO SEE THAT MORE THAN 50% OF TOOTH IS MISSING TO JUSTIFY PAYMENT FOR BUILDUP
- POST-OP x-rays and IOs
- Crown Seat BW/PA
- If an Endo was done (or prior/existing endo), you must take a PA in addition to BW on prep date and be sure to include FULL apices of tooth
- INCLUDE IN CHART NOTE IF BU/CRN IS INITIAL OR REPLACEMENT!
- If there was existing buildup or crown, need date of prior placement & reason for replacing
- Include DX and REASON for treatment
- Endo
- PRE-OP XRAY (PA) -- must Include full apices of tooth
- POST-OP XRAY (PA) -- Includes full apices of tooth
- Must take PA AFTER bite block and any other instruments have been removed so insurance does not think it’s an “in-progress” xray
- Implants (including final restoration on existing implants)
- PANO OR CBCT IS REQUIRED
- Pre-Op, In-Progress and Final x-rays and IOs
- Can be BW/PA/Pano as long as the site of tooth being replaced is visible
- If tooth is extracted at our office, include pre- and post-extraction films
- MUST KNOW Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?
- BE MINDFUL OF MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE!
- Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!
- Bridges/Dentures
- PANO OR CBCT IS REQUIRED
- Same xray/IOs needed as for Crowns
- Need tooth-by-tooth narrative
- Teeth being replaced and reasoning
- Include in Chart Note if it is Initial vs. Replacement
- If replacement, include date of previous prosthesis, reason for replacing
- Date of Tooth Extraction/How long has the tooth been missing?
- BE MINDFUL OF MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE!
- Remember that replacement frequencies are shared for all crowns/bridges/implants!
- Expected prognosis for longevity of bridge
---
# Missing Tooth Clause

If a tooth was missing prior to the patient's insurance coverage going into effect, the implant/bridge to replace the tooth is not covered!

# SRP

- Be sure we have x-rays (BW & PAs) of all teeth that receive SRP.
- Bitewings need to show all the way to gum line
- Sometimes we only have BWs on file from NP appt, and will need to take additional PAs of the anterior teeth for submission to insurance
- A Pano will NOT be accepted by ins - must take BWs and PAs for SRP
- IOs can be helpful if x-rays are not strongly indicative of need for SRP, if pt has significant bleeding upon probing, etc
- Must also have Perio Charting that was done within the last 6 months
- Pocket depths should be at least 5mm+
- Co-morbidities/Health Hx can be useful as well, include in chart note
- IF a patient had SRP done at another office and is switching to you for Perio Maintenance, you will need prior SRP dates for insurance claims

# Ortho

- Must have PANO
- Expected Duration of Treatment
- See Ortho Billing protocol especially for CIGNA patients

# Wisdom Teeth Extraction

- PANO IS REQUIRED
- Obtain pt’s medical insurance info in case we need to bill to it for 3rds
---
# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

# New Patient without insurance

- Take FMX per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

# Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

- Send on Claim: FMX only D0210
- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X Rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 8 Posterior PAs)
- A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional x-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional x-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment, etc.
- If we take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL
- If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X Rays

- Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)
- Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim! (Here’s an EXAMPLE for why)
- Take 4 BW-X Rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA x-rays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA x-rays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X RAYS

- Send on Claim: FMX only D0210
- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 4 BW-X Rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 4 BW-X Rays D0272 & Pano D0330
- Send of Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X Rays. (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance
- Send on Claim: 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY
---
If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.

If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW & 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!

If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern.

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #24).
- NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.

Pay careful attention to any note from ins coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to the patient portion.

- This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but may waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
- If deductible applies to all x-rays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect the deductible amount from the patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW x-rays if they are not covered @ 100%.
- If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional x-rays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion.

We take a new FMX every 3-5 years unless needed for a specific reason before then.

# Adult Recare - DUE FOR X-RAYS but NOT Eligible for BW (plan allows only 1x/24 months)

Send on Claim: 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), THREE Addt’l PAs as D0230 (+tooth #)

- In the instance that a plan only allows bitewings once in a 24 month period, some plans (such as Delta Dental) will allow you to take and bill out up to 4 PA x-rays in a visit.
- Hygienists may still choose to take bitewings and 2 PAs as usual, but on the claim, we will bill out 4 PAs.
- REMEMBER THAT WITH PAs, The first PA you take will use the code D0220, and ALL ADDITIONAL PAs will use the code D0230.

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)

If the patient is due for x-rays and is eligible for a FMX and we have not taken one in 3+ years, delete the BW & PA codes and change to a FMX (D0210).

- Can be due to patients changing insurance, not being eligible for FMX at their very first visit, etc.
- In the past, we used to bill out a FMX and just write it off if not covered by insurance. This may be the case for some patients (usually if their first visit was before the year 2022).
---
# PANORAMIC X-RAYS - no bill insurance most of the time

- Many times we take a Pano on patients for diagnostic/treatment related reasons (i.e. Wisdom teeth, implants or bridges, ortho, etc.)
- ONLY EVER BILL OUT A PANO TO INS IF IT IS PART OF A FMX COMBO (PANO + 4BW).
- Pano and FMX share a frequency on insurance plans, but the fee for a FMX is about $30 higher than that for a Pano, so when we only bill out a Pano, we are missing out on potential production. Also, if you add the Pano to a visit where we are taking other x-rays, keep in mind that this can prevent us from getting paid for any other x-rays if the patient is not eligible for a FMX.

# EXAMPLE: INCORRECT SUBMISSION OF CLAIM WHEN NP IS INELIGIBLE FOR FMX.

***When a New Patient is not eligible for an FMX we want to take 4 BW x-rays & 2 PA x-rays so we have as much information as possible. Due to the fact that we have explosion codes for NP appointments, sometimes the team misses the financial coordinators notes regarding patient not being eligible for FMX, thus we take & bill out FMX and it gets denied and we end of not billing to patient because the last thing you want to do is lose trust with a NP by not informing them of their copay. This document is to explain to clinical team members how to avoid this error.
---
On the appointment in Open Dental:

- Verification notes state that patient is NOT eligible for FMX (D0210)
- CORRECT: Code for 4BW (D0274) was added instead.
- ERROR: The code for FMX (D0210) should have been DESELECTED from the appointment, but not deleted entirely from the treatment plan.
- OTHER: A PA for #19 was then taken as it was needed per treatment plan. (It is okay to bill a single PA in addition to BW, as these two services would not be recoded to a FMX.)
- Rule is that if the submitted fees for x-rays will total that of the FMX, all services will be recombined/coded as an FMX ($168).
- BW ($83) + PA ($39) = $122 -- OKAY
- BW ($83) + 2 PAs ($39 & $33) = $155 -- OKAY
- BW ($83) + 3 PAs ($39, $33 & $33) = $188 -- NO
---
# Submitting the Claim:

- ERROR: Claim was submitted including FMX, as well as BW and PA.
- If you submit an FMX, NO OTHER x-rays can be submitted, as they will be considered “inclusive of” the FMX.
- If patient is not eligible for FMX, they will then be considered ineligible for all of the submitted x-rays.
- INCORRECT: Staff member entered Adjustment for the amount of FMX ($168) as a Friends/Family courtesy, since the patient was not eligible for FMX.
- CORRECT: DESELECT the FMX code and do not include on the claim at all

97
---
# EOB/Payment Received from Insurance:

Here is an example explanation of benefits showing that the FMX was denied due to a frequency limitation. Of course frequency will vary by insurance plan, thus this is something we find out on every insurance verification.

MX was not payable due to frequency limitation. EOB shows that this amount will be patient’s responsibility to pay.

- Even though patient is theoretically eligible for BW & PA, since the FMX was included on the claim, no payment was made for these services as they are considered “inclusive of” the FMX.

98
---
# Entering Payment for the Claim:

- Write off full amount for FMX since it should not have been included on claim
- In order to do this, the $168 Adjustment had to be deleted from the patient’s chart
- Entered allowable amount for BW & PA, but no payment was received. Included note as to why no payment was made
- Enter note: Claim in resubmission for payment on x-rays
- Patient’s chart now shows a “balance” of $120.14
- Pop-Up Alert is made to show that this is not a true balance on the account
- Also made note in the patient’s next appointment in August, in case we have not received payment on the claim at that time
- The Financial Coordinator must file an appeal for payment on x-rays...
---
# Appeal Process:

- Claim was resubmitted via Dental Exchange
- Deleted FMX code from submission
- Included an explanation/narrative as to why we should be paid
- Now we wait for payment…
- If payment IS made...
- Update claim and post the payment
- Delete pop up note from patient’s chart regarding balance
- If Payment is NOT made…
- Update the claim to show payment was denied
- Balance will still be on account, discuss w/ provider to determine how to handle
- Option 1: Charge the patient for the x-rays (call patient and send bill, update popup to show pt DOES owe a balance, etc)
- Option 2: Write off the expense of the x-rays (make adjustment to account, delete popup, practice eats the cost of the x-rays and also the time/effort spent on the appeal process)
---
# Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) Criteria/Protocol

- X-RAYS
- Make sure we have quality x-rays to send along with SRP claims. Take BW and/or PAs as needed, even if the pt is not eligible (we can write it off)
- Bitewings need to show all the way to bone levels
- Sometimes we only have BWs on file from NP appt, and will need to take additional PAs of the anterior teeth for submission to insurance
- A Pano alone will NOT be accepted by ins - must take BWs and PAs for SRP, but can send in a pinch if the other x-rays are not of proper diagnostic quality
- X-rays should show crestal bone loss/loss of attachment - please assist front office with adjusting contrast of x-rays for claim submission if needed
- Good IOs can also be helpful. (i.e. If a patient has significant bleeding upon probing, etc.)
- If SRP is denied, we can submit an appeal, annotating x-rays further to show spurs, calcium deposits, measure loss of attachment
- Perio Charting
- Each insurance company has slightly different criteria, but typically patient should have at least 5mm+ pockets to qualify for SRP
- Be sure that perio charting has been completed, and within the last 6 months
- Comorbidities/Health Hx
- This can be useful as well to include in chart notes
- Smokers, diabetes, systemic/autoimmune disorders, over age 40, no dental care in a long time, family history, etc
- Scheduling SRP
- ALWAYS BEST TO ONLY DO 2 QUADS PER DAY
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER 4 quads same day if a patient has Delta Dental, Aetna, or United Concordia insurance!!!!
- If pt does not have one of the aforementioned insurances, only schedule 4 quads same day if it is in conjunction with other treatment and sedation
- Must have a detailed narrative with the rationale for 4 quads same day (i.e. patient has had past dental office trauma, needed sedation and all tx completed in one visit)
- Patient Convenience and/or scheduling conflicts is NOT a sufficient rationale to get this approved
- Same day SRP - maximum 2 quads, no matter the insurance!
- Make sure that supporting documentation for diagnosis is fantastic.
- Review patient’s benefit breakdown to ensure no other random stipulations like waiting 7-14 days between sides, etc
- First perio maintenance must be minimum of 3 months +1 day after SRP
---
# Full Quadrant (D4341) vs. Limited SRP (D4342)

- Use D4342 for only 1-3 teeth within the quadrant that need SRP (probe depths of 5mm or greater)
- Use D4341 for 4+ teeth within the quadrant that need SRP
- Keep in mind that INSURANCE companies assume/expect that it takes at least 60 minutes PER QUAD when we do SRP.

# When does the patient qualify for perio maintenance cleanings rather than prophylaxis?

- After receiving SRP on TWO FULL QUADRANTS OR MORE
- D4342 on just one quad will not require subsequent PMV
- TWO quads of D4342…judgment call for subsequent PMV vs Prophy

# Limited SRP (D4342) with Prophy (D1110)

- If a patient only needs limited SRP on a couple teeth (ONE QUAD ONLY), this will have to be done on a separate appointment after the prophy. YOU CANNOT BILL OUT A PROPHY (OR PERIO MAINTENANCE) IN CONJUNCTION WITH ANY SRP SERVICES.
- NOTE: our policy used to be that we allowed you to perform both on the same day and we’d send an appeal to insurance when the prophy or the srp get denied. We have had multiple appeals denied from multiple insurance companies, so have changed our policy. SRP cannot be done on same day as a prophy or PMV
- Patient will remain on regular prophy (D1110) cleanings

# Gingivitis Cleaning (D4346)

- Coverage varies on this code. Many plans do cover at 100%, but some will consider it at 80% with deductible applicable.
- Some plans will have additional specific criteria such as patient should have no history of cleaning in at least 12-24 months. Some plans use same frequency as other cleanings for this code, where others allow only 1 in 24 months
- Patient will go back to regular prophy (D1110) afterwards, NOT perio maintenance

# PreAuthorization/PreEstimate/PreDetermination of Benefits Tips

- Prioritize the Treatment: If a patient has a ton of treatment to be done, prioritize specific services and only send for the first priority
- Sending a lengthy PreAuth with too many services will delay its getting approved
- A PreAuth with too many services will also likely not be accurate because the annual maximum may or may not get factored in, so the PreAuth may show more or less coverage than would actually be allowed at time of service
- Patience is a virtue: Do not send a PreAuth if the patient is not willing to wait on treatment until after PreAuth comes back!
- If an insurance company has not processed a PreAuth and sent it back, then receives a claim for the same services, it can delay processing of the actual claim, often causing denial of payment.
- Read the Fine Print / Read Between the Lines: the “estimated payment” amounts may or may not take deductibles and annual maximums into account
- Some insurance companies (like Metlife & Aetna) will send an estimate that solely tells you whether or not a service would be covered, theoretically, and do not factor in a deductible, annual maximum or other insurance coverage into their “covered amounts”

105
---
Some insurance companies (like Tricare) will take deductibles and annual maximums into account, so a list of treatment that more than exceeds the annual max will show “denied” or “noncovered” services, which would otherwise be paid if the patient were to prioritize and plan their treatment based upon benefits remaining, and their plan’s benefit year renewal, etc.

# Know What It Means:

There is a difference between a “PreAuthorization” and a “PreDetermination” or “Dental Benefits Estimate”, and obtaining this document does not guarantee payment from insurance after we send the claim

- PreAuthorization = approval of payment for services rendered on a case by case basis
- A true PreAuthorization will ask for supporting documentation to determine, ahead of time, if the insurance company will pay for a service
- Example: a buildup/crown PreAUTH would give approval that the insurance company has reviewed the patient’s x-rays/IOs/other documentation, and concludes whether or not it meets criteria for payment to be made.
- There will likely be a timeframe included with this PreAuth, noting that the services must be completed within X amount of time before the guarantee of payment expires. --- SUCH AS WITH TRICARE ACTIVE DUTY
- PreDetermination/PreEstimate = telling us what the plan will cover, in a perfect world (likely just confirming what our insurance department already “verified”)
- A PreDetermination or Estimate will only review the plan’s coverage guidelines, not taking the patient’s specific case into account
- Example: a PreD/PreEstimate will simply tell us “assuming the documentation included with the claim on the actual date of service meets our criteria, then we will pay 50% of the allowable amount for buildup and crown, but we will downgrade the crown to D2791, etc”.
- “A PreDetermination is NOT a guarantee of payment”
- We don’t have the option to choose a PreAUTH vs. PreEstimate - a company like Metlife will not guarantee payment ahead of time.

# Main Takeaways:

- If a patient wants a true GUARANTEE of what insurance will or will not pay, we need to confirm that the insurance company provides true PreAUTHORIZATIONS, and if so, it will take longer for that to be processed by insurance.
- Your patient should be willing to wait for the PreAuth to come back before proceeding with treatment, otherwise there is no point in sending a preauth.
- Don’t include too many services on one PreAuth.
- Review the PreAuth carefully before discussing it with a patient - make sure deductibles, annual maximums etc get taken into account.

# Tracking the Dollar

If there is the number one KPI, or Key Production Indicator, for an office, it is collections. Dollars coming into the office. If there’s no money coming in, then bills don’t get paid, employees don’t get paid, and the business doesn’t stay in business very long. That is why it is of such importance to track where each dollar goes in the practice.

Here’s a few steps and important items to consider when following a dollar through your practice.

1. End of Day reconciliation
1. In order to track the money being collected and keep an eye on any embezzlement, it is a really good idea to have an end of day reconciliation process in place. We have utilized this spreadsheet and it works out really well. It’s also a good idea to have more than one person involved as a check and balance. This spreadsheet is broken up into insurance collections, patient collections, 3rd party financing collections. The total is then balanced against what is seen in the bank's operating account to make sure everything in open dental matches up with the money that has actually hit the bank account. If your practice is mature and cash flows are fairly consistent, by the end of the month the total amount in the bank vs. the total amount collected from the open dental report should be very close. If your practice is younger and growing fast this can vary more. The discrepancy is going to be minor because of the payments towards the end of the month that may have been technically collected in the prior month but hit the bank in the first few days of the next month due to ACH transfers and the usual 48 hour delays with bank deposit processing.
2. Ensure that all payments (insurance checks, EFTs, patient credit cards, cash, CareCredit) entered match end of day report.
3. Deposit insurance and patient checks from the to bank; verify deposit balance matches end of day report.
4. Run procedures not billed to insurance report; send claims as needed.
5. Run patient portion uncollected report; allocate payments accordingly or follow up to collect from patients as needed.
6. Prepare huddle sheet for next days schedule.
---
# 2. EFT’s are the way to get paid

1. If possible, make sure that you set up each insurance company with direct EFT payments. This is for multiple reasons- but maybe the most important is that it’s quick. Some insurance companies will pay within just a few days of claim submission, which is insanely fast compared to the months it takes with other insurers. The other reason that EFT payments are important is due to the decreased risk for embezzlement. If the money goes directly from a payor to your bank account, then there is no risk for someone to intercept that money and steal it.
2. From a tactical standpoint, we suggest setting up the ‘Profit First’ method, where there is a separate bank account for incoming cash. Once that money goes into that account, it is moved over to an operational (outgoing checking) account. This way, you can give ‘Read-Only’ access to certain people in your office to see the EFTs coming in, and then they don’t see your entire bank account.

# 3. Petty Cash Log

1. It’s important to have a process for tracking cash. This will need to be reported to your CPA. It’s also good to have more than one team member paying attention in order to combat embezzlement.

# 4. Collections Tracking

1. In certain months collections could be higher than production and vice versa. Sometimes collections are higher due to a month in which to pre-collected a lot of money, but the production is scheduled for the next month. Other reasons could be if you had some AR caught up waiting for insurance to pay and you won a bunch of insurance appeals. Other months production may be higher because the docs did more dentistry and you’re waiting for insurance payments to catch up. By the end of the year the production/collection percentage should wash out and the goal would be a 98%+ collections rate.
2. This ebb and flow in collections is normal, and so it’s important to look at your KPI for ‘Collections Percentage’ over a 6-12 month time frame to truly get a sense of how well your office is performing at all parts of the process.
3. Typically at the end of the calendar year we see insurance companies deny claims more frequently, requiring more work for your financial team and pushing the collections into the next calendar year.

# 5. Collections Goals

1. Great financial coordinators are driven by numbers on a scorecard, Collections is #1.

# 6. Some other tips…

1. Don’t let insurances pay you with digital credit cards to avoid the merchant fees.
2. Document all procedures with IntraOral photos- this is your best defense against rejected claims - especially BU & crowns.
3. EFTs…typically take less than 10 days for payment.
4. Out of network pitfalls
1. Some will only pay in network rates.
2. Patient pays more out of network.
3. You can negotiate fees even when you are out of network.

# Cash Payment Log

|DATE|Starting Patient Name|AMT|Amt|Ending Cash|VERIFIED BY (2 staff members)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Cash Amount|COLLECTED (+)|Given to Dr. Blue|Cash Amount (-)| |

This log might be used if you are unsure about reconciling with OpenDental daily and/or counting cash in the drawer/locker daily.
---
# Cash Envelope Protocol

- STARTING CASH AMT + AMT COLLECTED - AMT GIVEN TO Doctor = ENDING CASH AMT
- BEGINNING OF DAY: Make note of the starting amount of cash in the envelope (it should match the ending cash balance from the prior day.)
- DURING THE DAY: Make a single line item for EACH patient’s payment collected.
- END OF DAY:
- Run the Daily Payments Report in Open Dental. The amount of cash collected during the day should be balanced with this report.
- Ending Cash Balance should equal the sum of starting and collected amounts, minus any amount given to Dr. Blue to deposit.
- (Usually we’ll still keep a few small bills for petty cash. $17 is usually good - one $10, one $5, two $1s)
- Two employees should count the cash and verify that it is balanced, and initial log

# Insurance Basics

# Credentialing

If you have ever credentialed a doctor before, be prepared for a long and frustrating process. If you are starting an office, your first step will be to set a UCR fee schedule, which stands for Usual and Customary Reimbursement fee schedule. We generally recommend setting rates at 90% of your area’s fees. You can get this from Henry Schein, Wasserman Medical, FairHealthConsumer.org, or the website www.NDAS.com. NDAS is the generally recognized leader in knowing which fees are best.

A few notes around tactics on credentialing:

1. Credentialing
1. Decide what you want your insurance participation to look like
2. Direct Contract: contracted with single insurance company i.e. Cigna, Metlife
3. Umbrella Networks: contracted with many insurance companies which honor 1 fee schedule (i.e. Careington, Zelis, Connection Dental)
4. Delta Premier vs. PPO- state dependent decision, talk to others in the area and see what is the best strategy for you
5. Tricare- do you want to participate?
6. Medicaid - do you want to participate? There are some offices we know of inside Dental Success Network that are only ‘in-network’ with Medicaid for extractions and oral surgery. This cuts out many of the lower reimbursing procedures and makes it a much more profitable proposition. Check your state’s reimbursement rates and see if it makes sense for you.
7. Do I need to use a company to help with this process? It depends, but probably not a bad idea for your first time doing this. Sometimes the right help in this area can pay dividends for years as you get set up with higher reimbursements.
8. See page 42 for a discussion with Ben Tuinei and Dr. Taher Dhoon in insurance and getting credentialed
---
# 2. CREDENTIALING CHECKLIST

1. Here is a checklist of documents to gather when credentialing a new doctor. It’s super important to start credentialing of a new associate as quickly as possible because (depending on your PPO participation - direct vs. umbrella network) it can take a while for insurance companies to recognize a new provider at a new location.
2. Expect for insurance companies to not recognize you as in network even after you see if online (especially true for your umbrella networks).
3. Once you’re credentialed with an umbrella network expect it to take another 90-120 days for each individual insurance company to recognize you under that umbrella fee schedule- fax to provider relations.
4. We recommend calling the individual insurance companies and documenting those calls because it will require follow up calls to inform them of your umbrella relationship and you will also want to fax the letter.
5. Delta Dental - typically a direct contract and very quick.
6. What to do when you’re still out of network?…there is no perfectly clean answer, so here are a few options
1. Goal: honor what you’ve told the patient & the signed treatment plan & build good will (take discounts as appropriate to make it equal to ‘in-network’ pricing).
2. Manage patient expectations on the front end. Inform them that you will be charging them as though you’re in network, but that you don’t know exactly how the insurance will behave.
3. Don’t be caught in the middle of the patient and their relationship with their benefit provider, you are simply the steward to maximizing the patient’s benefits.
4. Typical outcomes when we thought in network but not
1. Insurance paid you on full UCR - you win - but don’t go back to patient to collect any difference up to your UCR.
2. Insurance paid less than you were expecting as OON provider. In this instance send the claim back to the insurance showing in network & ask them to reprocess.
5. When Associate is still OON - what are my options…
1. Locum Tenes.
2. Some people will Bill under owner doctor until insurance companies recognize them - grey area.
3. Unfortunately insurance companies have no incentive to make this easy on us or the patient, so therefore, there is not a perfect solution here. It is up to us to manage patient expectations and remind patients that we are on their side, advocating for them to get the most out of the insurance that they pay for.

# 3. Credentialing Continued

1. Be prepared for a long & frustrating process….
2. Determine your UCR fee schedule (recommend 90%+ aisle for your area)-
3. Remember if you offer a dental savings plan with 15% off services and you’re at 90%, now you’ve discounted your fees to the 75% aisle. Take this into consideration.
4. You can get this from Henry Schein, Wasserman Medical, FairHealthConsumer.org.

# 4. What to do when an associate is still out of network?

1. This gets tricky, a gray area option is to bill under the owner doctor, technically this is not allowed, but some offices do this. Sometimes you can have them sign a Locum Tenens agreement so that all work that they do is billed under doctor owner, but this only works when doctor owner is on-site, watching over and checking all of the work done by the associate under “direct supervision”.
2. You could also just honor in-network fees, but this could be a big hit to the practice especially on hygiene if the insurance pays a lower percentage for preventive OON.
3. Typically since a new doc gets in with Delta very quickly, you could limit them to seeing patients with delta and no insurance until they’re recognized in network with other carriers (again not ideal).

# 5. Network participation

1. This is a detailed spreadsheet that our financial coordinator made as a great reference for the rest of our front office team in order for them to understand exactly how we are contracted. As you can see this can get very confusing, we might be in network with Cigna BUT out of network with Cigna advantage. Anthem Blue Cross is also a very confusing one with DNOA & grid networks. This makes it very difficult to tell a New patient over the phone if we are in or out of network with their plan, but a sheet like this can give us a big heads up, it is likely we still have to call the carrier anyways in order to sure about that patients particular plan. As a rule of thumb we always schedule the patient and if we run into any out of network situations when the patient is expecting to be in network then we give them a heads up in order to not violate the patient’s expectations and get off on the wrong foot. As an aside for hygiene appointments that the patient has a copay (of course patients with insurance think every hygiene visit is “free”), we inform those patients on the confirmation calls what we expect their out of pocket to be for that appointment. If the insurance carrier refuses to give you a clear picture of what they’ll pay OON, over time as you build up history with other patients that are on the same plan you can estimate much more accurately.

# 6. Insurance Contact Information

1. You always want insurance company phone numbers & addresses at your finger tips. For credentialing purposes, if you develop and specific relationships with reps that are handling your doc’s credentialing, it’s a good idea to keep track of their contact info also.

# 7. Insurance Logins

1. You always want to have a list of the many insurance logins that you may have for easy reference.

# 8. Dual Insurance Notes

# 9. New Year New Insurance Sign

# 10. Crowns initial vs. replacement

# MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE

# WHAT IS A MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE?

- Some insurance policies will not pay for dental treatment to replace a tooth that was extracted/missing prior to the patient’s effective date of coverage
- Insurance will NEVER pay to replace any tooth that was missing before the current insurance policy went into effect
- I.e. A patient had active coverage through Cigna from 1/1/2021 to 12/31/2021. New plan with Delta Dental started on January 1st, 2022. Patient had a tooth extracted in October of 2021, and has an implant placed in February of 2022. MTC applies and insurance will not pay for the implant.
- There can be other iterations of a Missing Tooth Clause, but we use this as our assumption unless specifically indicated otherwise by an insurance rep or benefit faxback
- NOTE: This ONLY applies to a tooth that was not extracted while the patient had their current insurance plan! If we extract the tooth and then place an implant or bridge at the same time/while coverage has not changed, we do not need to worry about a MTC.

# WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO US AS DENTAL PROVIDERS?

- We will not deny a patient treatment to replace a missing tooth, but our treatment plan needs to indicate/estimate that insurance will NOT pay toward the bridge or implant to replace a tooth that has been missing since before the patient’s CURRENT insurance policy went into effect
- If Dr. Green extracted a tooth in 2021 while the patient had Cigna insurance, if they switch their coverage to a BCBS plan in 2022, that new plan will not pay for the implant/bridge on that same tooth if a MTC applies.
- When placing a bridge, be sure to check for a MTC.
- We may be able to appeal for payment on the abutment/retainer crowns of adjacent teeth if those teeth had decay/need for restoration! - Be sure to review potential coverage for each unit of the bridge!
- When placing an implant, be sure to check for a MTC.

# TREATMENT & CODES THAT APPLY TO A MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE:

- Implants: D6010 (implant body), D6057 (abutment) & D6058 (implant crown)
- Bridges: D6740 (retainer crown) & D6245 (pontic), or Dentures

# WHEN DO I NEED TO CHECK FOR A MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE?
---
# Front Office:

- We check for a Missing Tooth Clause upon verifying any new insurance plan!
- We indicate if a patient’s plan has a MTC on the new patient insurance verification note added to NP appointments

# Financial/Insurance Coordinator:

- Will check for a Missing Tooth Clause when preparing huddle sheets and looking at Treatment Scheduled for the following day (this will not include any treatment that gets added or picked up on the same day!)

# Hygienist/Dental Assistant:

- Check for a Missing Tooth Clause if a patient indicates to you that they hope to have an implant or bridge to replace a tooth they’re already missing, or if it is recommended by/discussed with the doctor during an exam.

# Treatment Coordinator:

- Check for a Missing Tooth Clause every time you prepare a treatment plan that includes a bridge or implant.

# HOW DO I FIND OUT IF MY PATIENT’S PLAN HAS A MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE?

- Is it indicated on the patient’s first appointment notes?
- Check the patient’s Insurance Plan under the “Family” module
- The plan notes section should have a line near the top that says one of the following:
- YES Missing Tooth Clause - this means the plan DOES Have a MTC, so coverage is NOT available for a missing tooth
- NO Missing Tooth Clause - this means the plan does NOT have a MTC, so coverage IS available for a missing tooth
- __ Missing Tooth Clause - this means the information we have been able to obtain from insurance thus far was not clear one way or the other, and we will need to call the insurance company for clarification
- Check the patient’s insurance breakdown under “Images” - “Insurance / Card Photos”
- Know how to read the verbiage - see above (and it may or may not be on the documents we have)
- Ask the insurance coordinator for help whenever in doubt! We can also
- Check the patient’s insurance website
- Call the patient’s insurance carrier

# ANY OTHER INFORMATION I NEED TO CHECK?

- Date of Extraction of the missing tooth!
- Is there an old bridge/implant already there that we are replacing?
- If so, date of original placement
- What date did the patient’s current insurance plan go into effect?
---
● Did the patient have other insurance coverage leading up to their current plan?

○ Was the old plan with the same employer?

# BONUS NONSENSE FROM INSURANCE!

● Sometimes when we see “YES MISSING TOOTH CLAUSE”, there are extra caveats to go along with it.

# OTHER VARIATIONS OF MISSING TOOTH CLAUSES

● Continuation of Coverage: Insurance will not pay to replace a missing tooth UNLESS it was just extracted recently (usually within 6-12 months) and the patient did have other active insurance coverage at that time

■ I.e. patient had active coverage through Cigna from 1/1/2021 to 12/31/2021. New plan with Delta Dental started on January 1st, 2022. Patient had a tooth extracted in October of 2021, and has an implant placed in February of 2022. MTC is waived and insurance will pay.

● If a patient's tooth was extracted in 2017, this plan would not pay to replace that tooth under these conditions.

● Waiting Period: Insurance will not pay to replace a missing tooth until the current plan has been active for X amount of time (usually 12-24 months). After that waiting period, coverage would be allowed to replace the tooth.

■ I.e. Plan goes into effect 1/1/2022 - patient would have to wait until 1/1/2024 before this insurance policy would pay toward the implant.

● Reduced Coverage: Insurance will reduce payment on replacing a missing tooth by X amount (usually a 50% coinsurance reduction on services) for the first Y amount of time (usually 12-24 months). After that period of time, coverage will increase to the full amount for that particular service.

■ I.e. An implant on a missing tooth is only covered at 25% instead of 50% for the first 12 months of coverage. After 12 months, the coverage goes up to the normal coinsurance of 50%.

If you are heavily involved with PPOs consider a sheet like this that the front office team can quickly reference to determine if you are In or Out of Network with particular insurance plans. As you can see for example, just because you are “in network” with a certain company like Cigna, does not mean they will treat you In Network for all of their plans, i.e. Cigna Advantage.

# Dual Insurance Coverage

# Coordination of Benefits (COB) Types

- “Standard” or “Traditional”
- Allows the beneficiary to receive up to 100% of expenses from a combination of the primary and secondary plans
- “Maintenance of Benefits”
- Reduces covered charges by the amount the primary plan has paid, and then applies the plan deductible and co-insurance criteria. The plan therefore pays less than it would under traditional COB and the beneficiary is typically left with some cost sharing
- “Carve Out”
- First calculates the normal plan benefits that would be paid, then reduces this amount by the amount paid by the primary plan
- “Non-Duplicating”
- If the primary plan paid the same or more than what the secondary carrier would have paid if it had been primary, then the secondary carrier is not responsible for any payment at all.
- “No-Dual” non duplicating. If Delta Dental Plan is secondary and the primary is also Delta Dental then the secondary will not pay anything

# Determining Primary vs. Secondary Plan

- IN NETWORK vs. OUT OF NETWORK
- IN NETWORK TRUMPS OUT OF NETWORK. If what would normally be the primary plan is out of network, but you are contracted with the secondary plan, then secondary should be used as primary!
- COB PROVISION vs. STANDARD
- STANDARD COB TRUMPS OTHER PROVISIONS. The plan WITHOUT any COB Provisions (aka “standard” coordination) will be primary to a plan WITH a COB Provision (ex. Nonduplicating)
- Subscriber vs. Spouse/Dependent
- The plan in which the patient is the subscriber is Primary. The plan in which the patient is a spouse/dependent is secondary
- A husband and wife who are both covered under their own and each other’s plans will have opposite primary/secondary benefits
- “Birthday Rule” - for Dependent Children
- If a dependent has coverage under both parents, the subscriber whose birthday falls earliest in the calendar year (not who is older) will be considered primary
- If Mom’s birthday is in September and Dad’s is in June, then Dad’s plan is considered the primary and Mom’s plan is secondary
- BIRTHDAY RULE ONLY APPLIES TO MARRIED COUPLES! If the parents are divorced, then court order/custody determines primary coverage

# More than One Employer/Self Plan (same Subscriber)

- If a patient has two plans for which they are the subscriber, whichever employer has covered the subscriber longest will be considered primary (a change in dental plan/carrier does not change the length of coverage time)

# Current Employment

- A retiree or COBRA plan will be considered secondary to any other coverage that is offered by a current employer

# Federal vs. Tricare

- If a patient has a FEDVIP and a Tricare plan, federal (FEDVIP) will be considered primary over military (Tricare) coverage.

# Medical plans with dental coverage

- Medical plan is considered primary to dental
- Some medical plans have limited dental coverage and will always have to be billed as primary
- These are often FEDVIP plans with BCBS or GEHA
- Sometimes a medical plan includes coverage for wisdom teeth or accidents. For those specific services only, claims will first be sent to the medical plan

The coordination of benefits between a primary and secondary insurer can be a huge obstacle in providing accurate estimates, as well as receiving timely payments. This has been difficult for dental offices for quite a long time, especially when insurers have no incentive to make it better. The good news is that over the years there have been a lot of different laws and regulations that have simplified this process. In this chapter, we will explain it in the simplest terms possible so that you can run a clean front office, explain it to patients, and have a high level of understanding within the team.

The most important thing to remember before we get into the finer details is YOU MUST SUBMIT ALL CLAIMS AT OFFICE FEES. This is very important because if you do not you will be short changing yourself on the secondary. Remember, not all insurances coordinate benefits and not all fee schedules are the same.

The first step when a patient walks in with two insurance cards is determining which is the primary plan, and which is the secondary plan. Most of the time a patient will come in with a plan in their name that they have through their employer, and a plan that they are a dependent on through their spouse's employer. In that case, the plan they have under their employer would typically be their primary plan, and the plan they are a dependent on would be their secondary plan. Note that the birthday rule does not apply in this scenario, but that is not always the case. You will need to double check with the insurance to be sure. There are some plans that use one rule over another, some plans determine primary based solely on the length of time a member has been ensured. So if a person has been insured under their spouse's plan for the last 10 years and is now insured through their employer, the spouse's plan may still be primary. This can only be determined by the patient calling their insurance to ask.
---
Tip: Often you can find the Coordination of Benefits (COB) rules on the websites once you have verified the benefits, however this is not always accurate to the specifics of the plans you are working with. Clarity can only be provided by the insurance. The patient can call either insurance for the answer.

# What about a child that is covered by two plans?

In that case the primary plan is typically determined by the birthday rule, whatever parent’s birthday month and day (NOT year) come first in the year. If a patient has dual coverage and one plan is Medicaid, the Medicaid plan will always be secondary. A few things to keep in mind when it comes to this rule. It is a provisional rule that may not apply to every case. Remember that there are other circumstances that might change how benefits are determined.

Take a look at the following example for a little more clarity on how the birthday rule would work:

| |Insured 1|Insured 2|
|---|---|---|
|Subscriber DOB:|3/14/62|10/27/60|
|Insurance Company:|Cigna|Delta Dental of Virginia|

In this scenario above, the Insured #1’s date of birth is first in the calendar year, so the Cigna plan would take the spot as Primary.

Keep in mind that while this is the most common rule and system, sometimes insurances do not follow their own protocols. If there is any confusion as to which policy is primary or secondary, the best way is to have the patient call their insurance. They will typically require their subscribers to fill out a yearly questionnaire to provide their other insurance’s information so this determination has already been made unless the patient did not fill out the questionnaire. In this case all claims will be held until the information is provided by the subscriber to the insurance. The good news is, if a patient refuses to provide this information it is still billable, and at office fees no less, simply because benefits cannot be determined.

# Having two plans means a patient has dual coverage

but can be mistaken for “double coverage.” How does dual coverage work? Many patients will walk in thinking they won’t owe any copays since they are covered under two plans, which is not always the case. It is important to explain that a secondary policy is there to supplement their primary plan, and lower out-of-pocket costs. Two cleanings a year under each plan doesn’t equal four cleanings all together, and 60% coverage on Endodontics on a primary plan, and 50% coverage on a secondary plan doesn’t equal 110% coverage. We have actually seen patients think they will get “paid” to have dental work, although this will never happen! Even in cases that insurances do not coordinate benefits, it is important to note that you will never collect more than your office fee.

Look at this example of how an insurance that does not participate in COB (Coordination of Benefits):
---
# Primary

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|
|Primary Allowed Fee:|$200.00|
|Primary Payment:|$120.00|
|(paid at 80%, 50.00 deductible applied)|(paid at 80%, 50.00 deductible applied)|

Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.

# Secondary that does not COB

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|
|Secondary Allowed Fee:|$150.00|
|Primary Payment:|$120.00|
|(paid at 80%, no deductible, no COB)|(paid at 80%, no deductible, no COB)|

Write off would be 0.00, Patient owes $10.00

Without COB the patient is still responsible for the 20% copay, but cannot exceed the office fee.

Note in this scenario, the secondary would have the Copay for the patient being $30.00 but because the office fee cannot be exceeded the patient portion is only $10.00.

Many insurance companies will work together to coordinate patient benefits. Traditional coordination of benefits (COB) allows the patient to receive up to 100% of expenses paid between the primary and secondary plans. Non-duplication COB, in these cases the secondary plan will not pay if the primary plan has paid the same or more than what the secondary normally would if it had paid on its own. Self-funded plans are exempt from state insurance statutes, and not always subject to the same COB rules and laws. Self funded plans are those that are provided and paid for by employers. These are not formal insurance companies, they are simply paid for by the company you work for. This is VERY rare to see. For example: say a patient comes in and has a comprehensive exam and a cleaning resulting in a bill for 250.00. You would generate a bill and send it with the patient, or generate a claim and send it to the employer. Once the employer received it they would issue payment to you. In this case there are no write offs and any difference between the payment and office fees is chargeable to the patient.

# Given similar circumstances to the last example here is how COB could play out.

# Primary with Deductible

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|
|Primary Allowed Fee:|$200.00|
|Primary Payment:|$120.00|
|(paid at 80%, 50.00 deductible applied)|(paid at 80%, 50.00 deductible applied)|

Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.

# Secondary that COB

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|
|Secondary Allowed Fee:|$150.00|
|Primary Payment:|$0.00|
|(paid at 80%, no deductible)|(paid at 80%, no deductible)|

Write off would be 50.00, Patient owes $80.00

Even With COB the patient is still responsible for the $50.00 deductible, but cannot exceed the office fee.
---
# Primary w/o Deductible

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|
|Primary Allowed Fee:|$200.00|
|Primary Payment:|$160.00|
|(paid at 80%)|(paid at 80%)|
|Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.|Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.|

# Secondary that COB

|Office Fee:|$250.00|
|---|---|

|Primary Payment:|$0.00|
|(would have paid 120.00 as primary, 80%)|(would have paid 120.00 as primary, 80%)|
|Write off would be $90.00, Patient owes $0.00|Write off would be $90.00, Patient owes $0.00|

|Primary Allowed Fee:|$150.00|
|Primary Payment:|$120.00|
|(paid at 80%)|(paid at 80%)|
|Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.|Do not write anything off yet!!!!!!! This may cause an inaccurate credit once secondary payment is received.|

# Timeline for Primary and Secondary

Keep in mind that while the practice can collect up to full office fees between primary and secondary plans, it is the full fee per procedure not per visit. Meaning if primary and secondary pay you up to your office fees on a visit, but overpaid $5 on an exam and didn’t pay the full fee on bitewings, you will need to call the insurance company and let them know about the overpayment. If your patient has a self-funded plan and there is an overpayment, that money goes back to the patient, not the insurance company.

Due to the complexity of primary and secondary coordination it can be difficult to present accurate treatment plans but, Open Dental has gotten really good at providing estimates that are fairly accurate. Given that you have entered the plan correctly with the correct fee schedules and have indicated whether or not they coordinate benefits it should be close to perfect. If you are receiving benefit
---
Payments that are greatly different from the estimates you are presenting, something is wrong with the plan you have entered in Open Dental. Take some time to review the breakdown of benefits and clear up the COB rules of the plans. This should help with making accurate estimates.

If you need to indicate how the plans coordinate benefits, this can be found in the Edit Insurance Plan window. You will want to toggle to the Other Ins Info section.

In this window you will see the prompt for COB Rule. In this case selecting basic will demonstrate how insurance would pay if they do not coordinate benefits and Standard is the option for any insurances that do coordinate. Keep in mind that there is no where in this section to note how they determine who is primary so
---
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SIGN THAT YOU CAN PLACE AT YOUR FRONT DESK OR CHECK OUT AREAS DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHEN PATIENTS OFTEN ARRIVE WITH NEW INSURANCE CARDS / NEW PLANS FOR THE NEW YEAR.

WE RECOMMEND ALSO PUTTING VERBIAGE ON YOUR CONFIRMATION TEXTS ASKING PATIENTS TO NOTIFY THE OFFICE AHEAD OF TIME IF THEIR INSURANCE HAS CHANGED BECAUSE LAST MINUTE INSURANCE VERIFICATIONS ARE VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE TEAM AND IN THE EVENT WE CAN GET AN ACCURATE BREAKDOWN IT’S DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE A PATIENT PORTION ESTIMATE FOR SAME DAY TREATMENT

# New Year, New Insurance???

Happy New Year! Please take a moment when you check in to verify that we have accurate insurance information for you!

If you have new insurance as of January 1st, please let our front desk know before you are taken back for your appointment.

Thank you!

# Insurance Verification

# 1. Insurance Breakdown

- a. Depending on the insurance company some have great online breakdowns (i.e.: Cigna, Metlife, Delta (some states))
- b. Many states you still have to call to get accurate information (i.e. BCBS)
- c. Sometimes you get most of what you need on fax back, but follow up with a call on specific codes - as needed
- d. The thoroughness of the breakdown that’s entered in Open Dental will give you the best chance at an accurate estimate for the patient (BUT of course with insurance everything is STILL an ESTIMATE)

# Other Recommendations

- e. It is critical to get thorough and accurate insurance breakdowns. We have shared our one page breakdown here in this chapter. You may want to customize this to add or remove procedures you do or don’t do in your office. Representatives give us wrong information from time to time so you always want to write down the representatives first name, last initial, a confirmation number for the call, a date and time of the call. They tell us ”this call may be recorded for quality purposes.” We have had situations where we were told the wrong information on a breakdown thus quoted the patient the wrong amount out of pocket and in our appeals process we proved that we were told the wrong information and the insurance company made good on it. Sometimes we will even have the patient call during the appeals process to defend their own case.
- f. Build a spreadsheet for all insurance logins & phone numbers
- g. Make sure you to find out each individual patient’s eligibility for certain procedures: i.e. FMX, exams, what’s left on their annual max, have they met their deductible, has the insurance terminated?)

# 2. How to enter an insurance breakdown in Open Dental

- a. Entering insurance A to Z is exactly how we enter the breakdown into open dental. This is critical because it allows open dental to now spit out an accurate patient portion for us. Unfortunately it’s tricky to enter every last detail, therefore, there are some plan details laid out in the plan notes and we have also shared our template for plan notes that we enter. Treatment coordinators have to verify what they see on the treatment
---
# 1. Plan break down with what the notes say

This is particularly valuable when it comes to missing tooth clauses.

# 2. Delta Insurance verification

# 3. Insurance Half Sheet Protocol

a. We verify all hygiene appointments 48 hours ahead of time. This is critical for making sure the plan is still active, patient is still eligible, double checking what’s left of the patient’s annual insurance maximum.

# 4. New insurance half sheet

a. How many times do patients walk in with new insurance without giving us a warning? This sheet is one they can fill out for us so we can have the information needed to start verifying their new insurance. We don’t want to have our hygienists running behind so usually we let them start the cleaning while we’re gathering this info. This often happens at an existing patient’s first visit in a new calendar year. We follow the above protocol because we don’t want to tell an established patient that we can’t start cleaning their teeth until their insurance is verified, that would not be good for the patient experience.

# 5. Last Minute Insurance Protocol

a. For emergency patients the comprehensive insurance breakdown can be too cumbersome and time consuming when we are trying to pick-up same day treatment. This shorter verification protocol allows us to capture the important highlights of the plan in the event the insurance carriers online portal is inadequate. Additionally, if you know specific codes of the treatment you are picking up like an endo/bldup/crown, you can ask about coverage on those codes and the insurance maximum that remains.

# 6. How to tell if a patient has ortho coverage

a. Sometimes a patient’s insurance plan shows an Orthodontic Age limit (i.e. 18 years). However, patients sometimes have the option to elect for “adult” ortho coverage for the subscriber and spouse. The age limit will still apply for any dependent children, but the subscriber and spouse may still be covered with no age limit.

# 7. Insurance Verification with Veriffic and VeriSmart product - review and strategies

a. If you don’t have internal team time to get insurance verifications done, then we highly recommend Veriffic and VeriSmart for your office. Read through how to use it in this section.
---
# By Insurance Breakdown/Fax

- Some breakdowns will clearly indicate if Subscriber/Spouse ortho coverage is a benefit.
- Example - Delta Dental of CO breakdowns will have a line in the upper right section that says:
- Subscriber/Spouse Ortho: YES or NO
- Some breakdowns will NOT be clear regarding ortho coverage, so we have to call to check. Insurance Verification team will often check this benefit and make a note in the patient’s eligibility.

# Under Patient’s Insurance Plan (Family Module)

- Insurance Verification Team will make note of whether the plan includes Ortho coverage/coverage for Subscriber/Spouse. This will be indicated in the “Subscriber note” section for the plan. You will see one of the following:
- YES Adult Ortho
- This means that even if the Ortho “age limit” is 19 etc, the patient has elected to include ortho coverage for the subscriber and spouse. Any dependent children would still only be covered until age 19.
- NO Adult Ortho
- This means that either the plan has no Ortho coverage at all for the family, or that the Ortho “age limit” of 19 etc will apply to all family members.
- ____ Adult Ortho
- If you see a blank link, it means our office has NOT confirmed ortho benefits.
- When in doubt, ask the Insurance Coordinator :)
- Last case scenario, we can send a PreAuth to Insurance ;)

# Entering Insurance in OPEN DENTAL: A to Z

First double check - is the patient or a spouse/parent the subscriber on the plan? If another person is the subscriber, make sure that person is added in Open Dental, included under same family, and set as “Guarantor”

# Adding a Subscriber in Open Dental

- If the family member is not already in the system…
- Under “Family” tab, click the “+ Add” Button next to “Family members”
- Enter the Subscriber's Name, gender, status (Patient or NonPatient), and if you are using their SSN as the insurance ID, add that as well. Click OK
- With subscriber’s name highlighted, click “Set Guarantor”

# Adding Insurance Plan to Patient’s Chart

- Go to “Family” tab on patient’s account
- Click the “Add Insurance” button (Yellow Umbrella icon)
- Is patient the subscriber? (Yes or No)
- If no, select Subscriber’s name from the list of family members. If the subscriber already has a plan attached to their account, this will come up as an option to select
- Before attempting to manually add the plan from scratch, click the “Pick From List” button to see if we have any other patients under the same insurance plan
- Use the Carrier / Group Name / Group Number options to search
- If there is an exact match, highlight the plan and click “OK” to add that plan to the patient’s account
- Once you have added the plan, set the relationship to subscriber (if it is not “self”), and then click out of the plan again. You cannot make any changes to an existing plan without exiting and reopening the Plan info

# Under Insurance Plan Information (lefthand gray column):

# Plan Info Tab

- Enter the Employer, Carrier (Insurance Company), Claims Address, Phone Number, etc.
- Add the electronic ID. This allows claims to be submitted electronically through dental exchange. This information can often be found on the benefits breakdown, or you can search it through open dental
- Enter the subscriber's group name and number
- Be sure to include the entire group number, as some employers will have just one or two digits differ between plans.
---
- Select Correct “Plan type”
- PPO Percentage: for PPO plans that are in network, or out of network plans for which we will honor a fee schedule other than office fees. Never use PPO percentage with “Office fees” as the corresponding fee schedule.
- Category Percentage: ONLY TO BE USED for out of network plans being billed on OFFICE FEES. For fee schedules other than Office fees, never use Category Percentage!
- Select the CORRECT FEE SCHEDULE: (See Scheduling Patients Based on Insurance for more info/to ensure you select the correct fee schedules)
1. Office fees- select office fees when the patient’s insurance is out of network and reimbursement will follow “UCR” or “Office Fees”.
2. BCBS P300- Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield or Anthem Blue Cross plans that are listed as “PPO 300” plans, “Complete” or “Grid Plus” plans also fall under this fee schedule. We are not in network with PPO 200 or 100 plans, or plans that are listed as “Prime” or “Grid” plans.
- For Fed VIP plans be sure to enter the R# (medical plan) or F# (dental plan) for the subscriber ID. They will not accept the SS# for insurance claims.
3. Careington - Umbrella network to use for: Cigna, GEHA, Beam, Guardian, United Healthcare, Metlife (PDP+ and FEDVIP networks only), Lincoln Financial.
4. Zelis - Umbrella network to use for Principal and Ameritas.
5. DHA (Dental Health Alliance) - Umbrella network to use for United Concordia (non Tricare), Sunlife, Assurant, and Mutual of Omaha.
6. Delta PREMIER - Use this fee schedule for all Delta Dental plans. Some patients’ plans may have lesser or no coverage under Premier. (Example: We cannot see EPO plans, PPO only, Pediatric plans). Also, Some plans may only pay off PPO Fees rather than Premier Fees, and difference will be patient responsibility.
7. United Concordia DOD plans - United Concordia plans that are for active duty military members and their dependents. These plans include “TriCare” and ‘ADDP” or “TDP” plans.

# Substitution of Codes (i.e. Crowns and Posterior Composites)

Does the insurance plan downgrade posterior composites? Crowns? On all teeth? Just molars? Just posterior teeth?

- If the plan does not downgrade for both crowns AND posterior composites, check the box for “Don’t Substitute Codes (e.g. posterior composites)
- If the plan downgrades only crowns, or only posterior composites, or only for certain teeth, click the box for “Subst Codes” to designate accordingly
- For each specific code, click the box under the “SubstOnlyIf” column to the correct option:
- Always
- Molar
- SecondMolar
- Never
- Posterior
- The far left column shows the code we bill (i.e. D2391), the 4th column designates the alternate code insurance will pay upon (i.e. amalgam, D2140). The alternate code will default to the most common alternate code, so it does not need to be changed unless an insurance rep tells you a different code.
- If a plan always downgrades both crowns AND posterior composites on ALL teeth, you do not need to change anything from default settings (but I would still click the “Subst Codes” box just to ensure that all fields read as “Always”)

# Coordination of Benefits

- If the plan’s Coordination of Benefits is Standard or “Birthday Rule”, this will default accordingly. But if the COB is “NON-DUPLICATING”, this should be specified by changing “COB Rule” to “CarveOut”. Note that this will only be a factor if a patient has dual insurance.

150
---
# Subscriber Information

- Enter subscriber ID (which may be the subscriber’s SSN)
- Effective dates
- Enter the initial date of coverage - this may be from several years ago. Not to be mistaken for the dates of the current “benefit period”. DO NOT put a date in the “to” field unless you know coverage is set to terminate at the end of the current month etc
- Note Section
- These are the details regarding benefits/eligibility that are specific ONLY to this particular subscriber and their family
- There is a template you can copy and paste into the notes area:
AS OF [DATE] (per call w/ REP, REF#):

[YES / NO] Adult Ortho Coverage

[PT NAME] IS ELIG FOR FMX/PANO, BW, EXAM, PROPHY. [YES / NO] HX OF PERIO ON FILE [your initials]
- Use the above template to ensure you don’t miss checking on any basic eligibility for services that we always like to check on up front
- Is the patient eligible for an FMX/PANO? -- these 2 services generally share a frequency
- Is the patient eligible for Bitewings (BW)?

151
---
- Is the patient eligible for an exam?
- Is the patient eligible for a cleaning?
- You also want to check if the patient has a history of SRP or PerioMaintenance, and get any dates of prior treatment

If a patient is not currently eligible for services such as FMX/PANO, be sure to note that along with what date they WILL be eligible. Type it into subscriber notes but also adjust the date by double clicking in the “Recall” section and selecting or adding a line for the particular service, along with the “actual due date”.

If a patient has a history of SRP/Perio on file, we also want to update this in the “Recall” section by clicking the box for “Set Perio”.

# Adjustments to Insurance benefits

(Top R hand corner in Blue)

- If the patient is not the subscriber, be sure to indicate relationship to subscriber (i.e. Spouse, Child, Dependent) from the dropdown in the upper green section.
- Be sure that every time you verify/update eligibility for a SPECIFIC PATIENT, you update the “AS OF ___” line, as well as click the “NOW” button for “Eligibility last verified”.
- Use this section to enter information relating to benefit amounts that have already been used. For example, if the patient has met their deductible for the year, enter it here. Enter any amount toward the maximum they have already used for the year.
- Note- we only enter this if benefits were used outside our office. E.g. the patient is new and we are verifying them for the first time. Patient goes to periodontist or other speciality providers throughout the year- update this information.
- Click the “Add” button on the far right and type in $ amount used toward annual max (insurance used) and the amount met toward the deductible (deductible used). Then click “OK”. This will update the patient’s benefits available when treatment planning.

# Under Benefit Information Section:

- Double click to open and enter plan specifics/breakdowns/ frequencies/ limitations
---
# Benefit Year

If the plan runs on a calendar benefit year, leave the box checked under “calendar” (this is the default), but if a benefit period begins at another time, i.e. July 1st, uncheck the calendar box, and type the specific month number in the “Month” section (i.e. “7” for July).

# Enter Annual Max and Deductible

Annual Max should be typed under the “Individual” box. Include the Deductible amounts for BOTH an individual and family. There is typically no “family maximum”, so leave that section blank, rather than a 0. Likewise, if a plan has NO annual maximum, leave the box blank rather than 0. However, if there is no deductible, type in “0”.

# Deductible Application

Most plans do not have the deductible apply to diagnostic & preventive services. This will auto populate to 0.00. You ONLY need to change this if the deductible DOES apply to x-rays (for instance, if a plan is out of network, the deductible may count toward all services, or just for x-rays etc.).

# Category %

The Category % column is to note the percent that INSURANCE will pay toward services. Note that some benefit breakdowns will list the patient percentage, so always double check what you are entering. Open Dental will default to D&P 100% / Basic 80% / Major 50%, but this may need to be changed. You can use the “Quick %” sections if all categories in a section are the same, however some plans may consider Endo/Perio/Oral Surgery under Major rather than Basic.
---
If a plan has “Waiting Periods” for certain services, be sure to note these next to the category as well. (This is why entering the PLAN EFFECTIVE date is so important, so we can tell if waiting periods have been met. (Also write “waiting periods satisfied” in patient notes section)

The Fluoride and Sealants “Through Age” should be the oldest a patient can be with coverage. If a breakdown states FL is covered for patients UNDER 18, you would put “17” as the through age.

Ortho Benefits may include a dependent age limit (i.e. age 19), but also include “adult” coverage for the subscriber and spouse. In this case, type 19 as the age limit, and in the subscriber notes, this is where you put “YES” for Adult Ortho.

Frequencies should be entered for services as either “every __ years”, “___ per benefit year”, “every __ months”, or “__ in the last 12 months”. The main benefit section view only shows the frequency for BWs, Pano/FMX, and Exams. Click the “More” button to open up frequencies for prophy, SRP, crowns, etc.

Be sure to carefully read the benefit breakdown regarding frequencies for exams and cleanings etc. Does it say “2 in a calendar year” vs “2 per 12 months” vs “1 in 6 months? The first implies that 2 cleanings are allowed to be done at any time per calendar year (may also say “benefit period”). The second would allow 2 within the last rolling 12 months, regardless of whether they fall within different calendar years/benefit periods. The third stipulates that cleanings must be spaced at least 6 months apart to the day. (I.e. If a cleaning is done on January 3rd, the next cleaning should be no sooner than June 4th)
---
- Double click on a line in the “Other Benefits” box to adjust the benefits on an auto populated line. Or, click “Add” to enter procedure codes that are not auto populated e.g. buildup, implant crown, occlusal guards, etc
- To adjust/specify the details of a code, note the following:
- If you are using a specific procedure code, the category must be “none”
- “Type” often defaults to “Limitations”, but if you enter a Coinsurance %, you’ll need to change it to “CoInsurance”
- Percent = Coinsurance %
- Amount = A dollar amount, such as for a $ maximum allowed, or a deductible
- Time period = often will be “none”, unless you are specifying a number of services per time period. (i.e. Full Mouth Debridement is often “1 number of services PER Lifetime”)
- Quantity and Qualifier are typically the frequency section you’ll use
- Coverage Level may be left as the default of “none”, or if you are specifying for a deductible/maximum amount, make this “individual”

# SUBSCRIBER NOTES SECTION

- These are the details regarding benefits/eligibility that are specific ONLY to this particular subscriber and their family
- Use the below template to ensure you don’t miss checking on any basic eligibility for services that we always like to check on up front
- - Is the patient eligible for an FMX/PANO? -- these 2 services generally share a frequency
- Is the patient eligible for Bitewings (BW)?
- Is the patient eligible for an exam?
- Is the patient eligible for a cleaning?
- You also want to check if the patient has a history of SRP or PerioMaintenance. If so we definitely want to indicate this!

Be sure that every time you verify/update eligibility for a SPECIFIC PATIENT, you update the “AS OF ___” line, as well as click the “NOW” button for “Eligibility last verified” in the green section at the top
- If the patient has already met their deductible, or has used any of their annual max benefits prior to their first visit with us, we need to indicate this by clicking the “Add” button for “Adjustments to Insurance Benefits” button in the upper green section
- If the patient is not the subscriber, be sure to indicate relationship to subscriber (i.e. Spouse, Child, Dependent) from the dropdown in the upper green section
- If a patient is not currently eligible for services such as FMX/PANO, be sure to note that along with what date they WILL be eligible. Type it into subscriber notes but also adjust the date by clicking in the “Recall” section and adding a line for the particular service, along with the “actual due date”
- If a patient has a history of SRP/Perio on file, we also want to update this in the “Recall” section by clicking the box for “Set Perio”

# Template to Paste into Subscriber Notes:

Example/details on above template

AS OF ___ (per call w/ REP, REF#):

- ORTHO SPOUSE: ___ (Y/N)
- DEPENDENTS: ____ (Y/N), AGE LIMIT: __

# OTHER THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:

- When adding a patient’s plan, be sure to first try “Pick from list” to see if it is already in there!
- Making note of Group name and group number is important for this reason
- Critical that we enter correct FEE SCHEDULES for a plan so that treatment plans and billing are accurate
- - Plan Type
- Fee Schedule

Effective date refers to the ORIGINAL date that the patient had this plan. Important because if there are any waiting periods we need to know if/when they will have been fulfilled
- Make note of the benefit period - is it a calendar year? Some patient’s plan benefit period may begin in July, etc. If that is the case, under edit benefit details, uncheck the benefit period box for “calendar year” and change to the month of the year that the plan renews
- Does a plan downgrade posterior composites and/or crowns?

# Insurance Verification

Use NEW PATIENT CALL SCRIPT to get the information you need. Always send new patient an email with New Patient paperwork link so they can fill out forms ahead of time.

Go to INSURANCE LOGINS screen, that’s where you’ll find the websites and phones numbers of the insurance companies.

- Insurance verification process varies with each insurance company and each plan for this Example we will review Delta Dental of Colorado

For Delta: go to website https://www.deltadentalco.com/default.aspx enter required information to get breakdown or call 800-610-0201 to get fax breakdown.

1. Download breakdown from Delta Website or Fax from Mango Voice Fax and upload in patients insurance field in Open Dental which is under “Images”

# Entering Insurance Breakdown Into Patient’s Open Dental Account

1. In “Family” click “add insurance” button, is patient subscriber “yes or no.”
2. Click on correct “carrier”, make sure address and payer ID is correct. (If carrier is not entered, enter the new carrier, if carrier is entered do not make a duplicate for that carrier)
3. Make sure “plan type” and “fee schedule” is entered correctly - example: we are In Network with Delta Dental so select “PPO Percentage”, “Delta”…we are NOT In Network with Metlife so select “Category Percentage” and “Office Fees”
4. Enter effective dates for plan and if it’s a calendar year or fiscal year plan.
5. Relationship to subscriber can be; self, spouse, child, etc.
6. Adjustments to insurance benefits: Click “Add” and enter if any deductibles have been met or any max used.
7. Double click on BENEFIT INFORMATION: category percentage breakdowns per plan
8. PLAN NOTES: use this section to write extra information we need. Example: posterior composite coverage, FMX HX, missing tooth clause, waiting periods, etc.
9. Use ADD button under “benefit information” to add procedure codes and benefit levels such as D9940 for occlusal guards, etc.

# Insurance Half-Sheet (3 month Update) Protocol

If a patient comes in for an appointment and it has been more than 3 months we will verify their current eligibility if they still have the same plan. We will fill out an Insurance Half-Sheet for them:

- BUT FIRST -- Look in Open Dental and make sure that the patient’s insurance plan has a FULL benefit breakdown entered. There should be a detailed description in the Plan Details section which will look something like this:
- If the plan does not have the full details, OR if the plan was verified by “LH”, the plan needs a full verification rather than just the 3 month update.
- See Full Verification Form

If the patient’s plan is fully verified/entered, proceed with the 3 month update protocol:

- See Half-Sheet Form
- Look up patient’s eligibility online or call insurance company
- Effective dates (current benefit year)
- Verify if the plan is on a calendar year, or if it’s based on a fiscal year/other benefit year
- Under Benefit Information on plan details in Open Dental, either check the box for calendar year, or change to specific month if necessary
- Group # & Group Name
- Enter the FULL group name & number, rather than just an part of the #, as some employers will offer multiple options to choose from
- Benefit Details
---
You may also want to glance at or ask if any of the plan benefits have changed recently -- or if you notice any important details missing (ortho coverage, occlusal guard benefits, downgrades on posterior composites or crowns etc), ask about and update that info.

Plan Benefit details that are not specific to the patient/subscriber should be entered under “PLAN NOTE” rather than “Subscriber Note”, so that it will be reflected accurately in the benefit details for all subscribers on the same group #.

# Check individual patient’s current status:

- Eligibility for Exam (PerEx / LimEx)
- Eligibility for Prophy / PerioMaint / SRP
- Eligibility for FMX/Pano
- Eligibility for BW
- Deductible amount met
- If the patient was treated by another Dental Provider during the benefit year, this may be different than what is shown in Open Dental. In that case, be sure to update by clicking the “add” button by “Adjustments to Insurance Benefits” in the upper right corner.
- Maximum used to date
- If the patient was treated by another Dental Provider during the benefit year, this may be different than what is shown in Open Dental. In that case, be sure to update by clicking the “add” button by “Adjustments to Insurance Benefits” in the upper right corner. This may affect treatment plan accuracy.
- These details should be noted in “Subscriber Note” rather than “Plan Note”. Recall dates for specific services can also be updated if necessary.

After all changes have been made, scan the half-sheet and upload to the patient's chart in Open Dental.

# Protocol for Verifying Returning Patients’ Insurance

- Hygienists will ask patients if insurance has changed during 1 week confirmation calls, and will make note/let front office know if patient has new insurance.
- Director of Operations (Lindsey) and Insurance Verification Team (April) will handle the majority of the half-sheet verifications. Goal is to remain at least 1 week ahead with these verifications.
- Short notice/same day verifications will be handled by Lindsey and/or Karen.
- Status for verification will be noted in the top line of appointment notes.
- I.e. “INSURANCE RE-VERIFIED [DATE, INITIALS]”, “NEED NEW INS INFO”, etc.

# Last Minute Insurance Verification Protocol

We as a team don’t want last minute insurance verification to be a stresser for any member of the team. Therefore, we are putting a protocol together in order to eliminate the stress points that come along with last minute insurance verification. We need to do our best to obtain insurance information from our patients even if it is at the last minute, in order to provide them the best experience possible.

1. The entire front office team will do their best to verify insurance prior to a patient's appointment however there are scenarios where the patient does not provide us insurance information until they arrive at the office.
2. Once we receive the patient's insurance information, scan it into the patient chart. Provide insurance information received to either Emily, Lindsey, Karen or Kelsey to obtain eligibility and fill out a quick verification form.
3. Advise the patient that “we will do our best to obtain as much accurate information as possible prior to completing any services.
1. If we are unable to verify the insurance we will charge any New Patients $200 for the New Patient special if it is a hygiene appointment, or full fee for any restorative work, crediting back any over payment after insurance has been verified, and insurance payment has been received.
4. Complete Quick Insurance Verification attached. Quick Insurance Verification Form
5. If full breakdown is not able to be completed prior to patients departure please have them sign “Small Balance Authorization Form” attached Small Balance Authorization Form. Using the following verbiage: “(Patient Name). We did our best to get an accurate insurance break down but because it was last minute there is always a chance that insurance could have some quirky rules. So we'll go ahead and get a credit card authorization for anything under $100. Anything over $100 we will call you to set up a payment arrangement.”
6. Email Bailey to complete full breakdown for last minute patients.

# Tips for finding patients insurance if they don’t have all of the details:

- Insurance companies can do national searches if we are unable to obtain the specific state.
- Ask where the subscriber's employer is located and that can help narrow down the state specifics or google the name of the company to find the state location of the main office.
- Ask if they used this same insurance at their previous dentist, call the previous dentist office and see if they can assist in providing us more details such as state or ID #.

# How to tell if a patient has Ortho Coverage

Sometimes a patient’s insurance plan shows an Orthodontic Age limit (i.e. 18 years). However, patients sometimes have the option to elect for “adult” ortho coverage for the subscriber and spouse. The age limit will still apply for any dependent children, but the subscriber and spouse may still be covered with no age limit.

# By Insurance Breakdown/Fax

- Some breakdowns will clearly indicate if Subscriber/Spouse ortho coverage is a benefit.
- Example - Delta Dental of CO breakdowns will have a line in the upper right section that says:
- Subscriber/Spouse Ortho: YES or NO
- Some breakdowns will NOT be clear regarding ortho coverage, so we have to call to check. Insurance Verification team will often check this benefit and make a note in the patient’s eligibility.

# Under Patient’s Insurance Plan (Family Module)

- Insurance Verification Team will make note of whether the plan includes Ortho coverage/coverage for Subscriber/Spouse. This will be indicated in the “Subscriber note” section for the plan. You will see one of the following:
- YES Adult Ortho
- This means that even if the Ortho “age limit” is 19 etc, the patient has elected to include ortho coverage for the subscriber and spouse. Any dependent children would still only be covered until age 19.
- NO Adult Ortho
- This means that either the plan has no Ortho coverage at all for the family, or that the Ortho “age limit” of 19 etc will apply to all family members.
- ____ Adult Ortho
- If you see a blank link, it means our office has NOT confirmed ortho benefits.
- When in doubt, ask the Insurance Coordinator :)
- Last case scenario, we can send a PreAuth to Insurance ;)

# Insurance Verification with VeriSmart product by Veriffic

Giving accurate treatment plans, and ensuring that patients have active insurance coverage, is very important. In today’s world, patients expect you to have this knowledge before they come in. In order to do this, you have two options; you can either dedicate one team member to checking all this, or you can outsource this. Verrific is the most popular company that can be used to outsource your insurance verification. We have found this to be the most cost effective way to verify insurance without slowing down the other front office systems. In reviewing the numbers, it is actually cheaper to outsource than to have a dedicated employee for this at most volumes. Leveraging this company has allowed us to dedicate more time and attention to patient interactions and keeps us from having to hire additional staff for this specific purpose. Since this is such a key part of our systems, we highly recommend it.

Verrific can be used to give detailed breakdowns of all services and codes, and the software even allows the opportunity to inquire about specific codes - for example we always verify the codes D9239 and D9243 since we do so much IV sedation. The most important part is that it directly uploads into OpenDental when the insurance is verified.

When you are ready to get your patient verified, you will first select your patient in OpenDental and make sure the insurance company is entered correctly and the ID matches what is on the card. Once you believe you have the correct information you will click on the “Verrific” button on your upper task bar. (You will be able to see this from anywhere in OpenDental.) The next image you will see is the box that allows you to select the type of ticket you are requesting. Note that you can select in or out of network to check benefits and in this drop down there is also an option for emergency for patients with appointments within 24hrs.

For a first initial verification, you will want to select the detailed button and this will give you the most comprehensive breakdown of benefits to include any additional codes you have requested specifically for your office. When you choose to re-verify benefits, this is typically saved for the second time a patient comes in and is recommended to be completed every year.
---
or before large treatment plans. You can also select “Bulk Create” to verify more than one patient at once.

Once your ticket has been submitted, you can view it in the Verrific portal and view any messages from the team member working the ticket. Status will show open working, on it, resolved (there would be button to import benefits), needs additional info, if it needs additional info you can click the link and reply to support, here you will be able to add comments and pics of insurance cards

170
---
Tip: Agent Aliases are used by Verrific because some Insurance companies will not provide benefits if a 3rd party is calling on behalf of your office. Aliases being used by Verrific will be provided and should be posted for your office members so they are aware that if a company calls asking for them that they are “employees working from home/remotely.”

Standard Detailed Breakdowns will come back in 3-5 days and will look similar to the next two images. Note that when you import the detailed breakdowns into OpenDental, the only thing that you will have to manually enter is the Ins Max Remaining and the Deductible Remaining.

Note on the second page you will find at the bottom the listed Fee Schedule for the plan. This is a drop down option in the Insurance Plan, this will need to be selected manually. The last section on the
---
breakdown is the History section. In this section you will find the most recent rendered services for the patient. This will often show exams, x-rays, prophylaxis, periodontal history, and some restorative if applicable. This can be helpful when it comes to plan frequency limitation. For example, see here that the patient received an exam and prophylaxis in April so according to the specifics of this plan the patient is eligible for one more exam and prophylaxis for the year of 2022.

172
---
The information that you import will auto populate in the Ins Plan Note section of the patients attached insurance plan. This will populate for all members attached to this dental insurance plan. The patient specific information can be found in the Subscriber Note, but this does not populate for each patient under the plan, just the specific subscriber you are on. It is important to check both of these sections for the detailed information prior to presenting treatment plans. Note in the image to the left there are two sections broken up by a “=================” line, which demonstrates the difference between the options. The upper section shows the Re-verified plan note and the lower portion has the detailed breakdown.

# Verrific is always working to improve the insurance verification process

Verrific is always working to improve the insurance verification process and is even beginning to introduce new capabilities to crowdsource benefits. The new VeriSmart Beta product allows offices that participate to pull benefits from their catalog of employer benefits and import them into OpenDental. With the goal of providing insurance benefits for each plan under each group at just the click of a button!

# VeriSmart Beta Software

Below is a picture of the VeriSmart Beta software. In one glance, you can see all the patients for a certain day, and whether they need to be verified for insurance purposes. To verify all the patients for the day, you can select certain patients and hit “Verify Selected”. If there is data needed, you can either Open the verification yourself, or Outsource this to have Veriffic do the verification. Once the data is ready and accurate, you can import it directly to OpenDental.

Once again, this is in Beta, so check out www.Veriffic.biz to keep up on the latest news.

# Chapter 9

# Insurance and Billing Verbiage

The words we use and how we say them matter in everyday life. Especially in the dental office, where patients may be scared and confused. Properly handling an out-of-network phone call and cancellation phone call can have a huge impact on patient acquisition and retention.

In addition, patients look to blame us when their insurance company doesn’t pay what was expected. Even if the patient knows better they’ll look to point the finger at us because it is easier and more tangible than calling a faceless insurance company.

Our hope is that this chapter helps your team become better communicators. To that end, we will spend this chapter on verbiage and using the correct words to get the desired results we are looking for.

1. Say this, not that verbiage
2. Dealing with insurance estimates verbiage
3. Insurance Out of network verbiage
4. Threatening insurance companies verbiage
5. Explaining Insurance claims to patients
6. Cancellation Verbiage
1. Cancellations can kill doctor and hygiene production. Proper verbiage can potentially get the patient to keep their appointment.
7. Front Office Training
1. This training is laid out in powerpoint format and can be extremely valuable for new front office team members. We typically like to review this with the team twice a year. We believe that running a great dental practice very much has to do with how well your team consistently executes on the fundamentals. This stuff may seem very basic, and it is, but if you listen to your team, they are straying from the verbiage you’ve taught them each and every day. They’re not trying to do a bad job, they just need the reminder from time to time.

First of all, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of one of our dear friends and mentor Alastair Macdonald. Alastair has shared many great concepts for handling difficult conversations with

175
---
patients. At the top of the list is tricky insurance conversations with patients. Littered throughout this chapter are ideas from Alastair that have helped our practices (and many others) minimize the negative outcomes that can be associated with insurance companies not doing what they say they will and thus patients being upset with us. We have found with proper delivery of some of the verbiage shared in this chapter, patients will understand these situations for what they are and not look to blame us for all of their unmet insurance related expectations.

# Say this not that verbiage

- Hang out NOT wait
- Insurance friendly/directly contracted/ participate with NOT out of network
- Courtesy NOT discount
- Patient Portion / Responsibility NOT Balance
- NEVER EVER SAY OUR POLICY
- Discomfort NOT pain
- Conservative NOT just/small (“just a small filling”)
- Numb NOT shot
- Most of our patients take advantage of the benefits of fluoride NOT do you usually get fluoride
- Complimentary NOT free
- Appointment change NOT cancellation
- Luckily/thankfully NOT unfortunately
- Verify insurance NOT run insurance
- Let’s go ahead and get you scheduled NOT do you want to get scheduled
- Pre-Collecting - Let’s go ahead and take care of that NOT do you want to…
- Fifty one - o - eight NOT five thousand one hundred and eight
- Directly Contracted NOT Out-of-Network
- Benefits NOT insurance
- NEVER EVER EVER TALK ABOUT DELTA PPO vs. PREMIER on a NP call- you can call them back and tell them if you found out it was PPO only
- On a NP call, when they ask “Do you take my insurance” before even saying hello….your response: “Let me be the first to welcome you to our office”

# Insurance and Provider Information

# Q: Are you in network with or Do you take my insurance? (NEW PATIENT)

A: I can absolutely help you with that, how did you hear about us?

A: You can certainly use your insurance, our team will make sure we can utilize your benefits to the fullest.

Or

A: Although we are not a preferred provider or directly contracted with your insurance company you can absolutely use your insurance in our practice. We are very insurance friendly and handle all claims on your behalf so that you can utilize your benefits to the fullest.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Have you ever wondered WHY insurance companies want to direct you to the cheapest dentist out there?

# Helpful verbiage when patient wants to see owner dentist, but the office is trying to build up new associate schedule

# Q: “I’d like to see Dr. Blue…”

(Your enthusiasm for the other doctor is key here!)

A: Dr. Blue is booked out the next 9 weeks, (pick a Dr. and use their full name) Dr. Alex Metcalf has been hand selected from hundreds of dentists by Dr. Blue, let’s get you in with him, in fact, we’re really lucky to have him, my mom just had some really complex dental work done with him and it turned out great, yup she’s thrilled.

# ADDITIONAL -

A: if I was in your shoes I’d be concerned the experience might be different with another provider, I can tell you we have full confidence in our team and Dr. Alex to continue to provide the great experience you’ve become accustomed to at our office.

A: I’m really sorry to hear about (your experience: repeat back patient’s problem and use their language. If they say their tooth feels tingly, use the word tingly), If I was in your shoes I’d be just as upset, you were expecting _______, but the result was not what you expected, what a complete inconvenience.

This is not good enough for us, we’re in the caring business and you left feeling you weren’t cared for. Here’s what I’d like to do for you, let’s go ahead and get you back in with Dr. _____ so we can all get on the same page and get this taken care of for you.

I don’t want to see that doctor, I want to see Dr. Blue.

I totally get it, I want to get this addressed right away for you so let’s start here…

# Cancellation Verbiage

This is a negotiation, do not slam the door on the appointment, keep the door open

When they lead with the excuse skip to #2

1. “Ohhh….can I ask what’s going on?
2. “Are you sure there’s no way you can make it?”

Insert patient excuse
3. I understand, “I’d really like to find a way to keep you on the schedule today to help you avoid the last minute appointment change fee”
4. “yes we require 48 business hours for any appointment changes to avoid the $50 fee”

If they absolutely must cancel
5. “Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# First Offense

“Yeah the appointment you had is really prime real estate, but I understand emergencies do happen so I will go ahead and take care of that for you today, but please remember we do appreciate at least 48 business hours notice in the future”

# Second Offense (within 18 months)

“Yeah you had a real prime appointment time, I’m really not supposed to do this, but I’ll go ahead and take care of this a second time”

“To book another appointment a credit card will need to be kept on file in case of another last minute change”

# Third Offense (within 2 years)

charge appointment change fee, inform patient DO NOT rebook

“Ok, we will go ahead and collect that appointment change fee and if there’s ever a day you can come in call us the day of and we will let you know if we can squeeze you in”

# What to do when we have an insurance plan that we don’t know how it will pay us…

1. Drop the coverage in open dental by 30% (so if it’s 80% for Basic - Drop it to 50%) (This will help soften the blow to the patient if insurance company tries to recognize us on connection dental fee schedule) - we are ok writing refund checks
2. The treatment coordinator becomes an Advocate for the patient against the insurance company

# Treatment Presentation Conversation with the Patient

Sitting next to patient shoulder to shoulder, pointing at the treatment plan

“Here’s the situation, it looks like this treatment is going to cost XXX now I’ll be quite honest, I looked at your insurance and what you have is Cigna, is that right ?” (you already know their insurance but you want to get them involved in the convo)

178
---
“Ok, so this morning Ingrid spent 45 minutes on the phone with your insurance company getting as much info out of them as she could, based on that conversation Ingrid had with your insurance this is what I estimate this treatment will cost, however, based in my experience with Cigna, I want you to know there is ample reason to expect these guys to behave badly, unfortunately Cigna has a history of coming back and making YOUR life miserable…”

“Now remember we already extend a XXX% discount to you so you don’t have to worry about that, but I know these guys and more often than not they are gonna come back and pay less in fact what myself & friends that work at other dental offices report seeing lately is they’re paying based on fees far below industry standards- that’s why the ADA is suing insurance companies like Humana - so don’t be surprised if this happens. So here’s what we are gonna do, after this discount (the in network discount), we are going to go with this amount here (circle it and initial) and let’s watch what happens. If there is one thing you and I both know it’s that insurance companies will never show up the way you or I expect them to. So in the event they come back and don’t pay as much as we are expecting, this will be infuriating to me so first I’ll go and sit down with Ingrid and we will go to battle for you and issue an appeal with them, but if we lose that battle we may need to work out a payment plan or something, we just can’t plan for all scenarios with these guys. SO fingers crossed, they’re not going to do this to US. 80% of the time we get the estimate perfect but it’s that 20% of the time that insurance doesn’t pay what we expect that causes major headaches for our patients”

# Additional helpful Verbiage

“We do everything we can to protect you from these guys but they’re still brutal”

“Remember it doesn’t matter what metropolis in the world you fly into - the tallest buildings in the world are insurance companies, so these parasites are screwing us all over, this is exactly how they pay for those tall buildings”

“We are very insurance friendly but we look at dental insurance as a coupon book…”

“We do everything we can to outsmart these guys and get accurate estimates for you, but ultimately it still is only an estimate”

“We constantly update your plan info and spend lots of time researching how we can maximize your benefits…”

“Insurance maximums have been $1,000 since 1970, 50 years”

# Ideas

These ideas are from a meeting our leadership team had when we were trying to address a slew of miscalculated patient portions. You may run into this in your practice, when we dove deeper these were the areas we were making the most mistakes and some ideas we had for combatting this.
---
- Get ahead of it with the above verbiage
- TC Checklist for wisdom teeth cases
- Don’t always have to give the price - today
- We could send pre-auth or call & find out what’s needed to process wisdom teeth for their plan
- Assume Sedation coverage at $0
- Get medical card
- Look at OS specifics for each code – coverage may be different between D7140 vs. D7210 vs. D7240
- Bill medical & dental at the same time so we can expedite the medical denial in the event it’s needed
- People that “need” exact #’s we can suggest a Pre-Auth
- Any Insurances that we know will treat us as OON???

# Additional Insights

Assume any errors are errors of understanding - patients don’t understand that these numbers are the insurance companies’ numbers - the numbers I’ve given you are in good faith from our research with your insurance company. (Get out of the way of your patient and their insurance company - matador) these figures are not my figures, these are YOUR insurance companies figures. I am simply the person that is holding the piece of paper so don’t kill the messenger. We’ve gone in and plugged the treatment plan in with what YOUR insurance company has shared with us about YOUR policy and here is what they tell us it will cost. If you’ve been alive as an adult for any amount of time then you’re aware you can’t trust an insurance company as far as you can throw them. We know insurance companies are prone to changing their minds so be aware we take these figures from your insurance company with a hefty grain of salt. This is a process and we will keep you informed of things as we go but this is our starting data. We’ll keep you posted if anything changes and we ask you to do the same.

# Expectations

let’s keep in touch. If either of us get any information that doesn’t fit these expectations let’s let each other know. We’ve got some tricks backstage, Ingrid is an absolute ninja and we’ll see what we can do if they behave badly. We are being burned for what the insurance company did to them.

# Response to a review about insurance

First of all that you’ve taken a chance to come see us and you had such a good experience that you came back makes me feel good about the work we do and the work that we are responsible for but for those out there that are reading this insurance companies do this to us ALL THE TIME. If you’re reading this they’ve done it to you too, somewhere along the line. My team and I continue to work on this case of one more empty promise from a large insurance company that said they’d pay for something that they now won’t. Thanks for giving us a chance to do what we do best, your dental work. We’re sorry that this happened.

# Out-Of-Network Q & A

# Q: Will I still be able to be treated in your office as a patient?

A: Yes! Although we are not a preferred provider with your insurance provider you can absolutely use your insurance in our practice. We are very insurance friendly and will continue to provide you with the support you've come to expect from us with respect to handling claims. For any treatment needs that you may have, our financial coordinators will help you utilize your dental benefits to their fullest.

# Q: Will it cost me more to come to your office once I move to out-of-network status?

A: Honestly, we don’t know. The insurance company will not share that information with us. It is possible that care in our office will have some minor differences in cost, but most of our patients tell us that the patient experience and high quality of service are well worth the small difference in fees.

# Q: Are my benefits going to change?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: Do I have to do anything differently?

A: Not at all. We will continue to treat you in our office and process your claims like we always have. With respect to any treatment needs that you may have, our financial coordinators will help you utilize your dental benefits to their fullest.

# Q: If I am unable to switch my plan and want to continue care in your practice, what options do I have?

A: We would love to still have you come to our office for your dental care. We are very insurance friendly and will continue to provide you with the support you've come to expect from us with respect to handling claims for your provider. If you have the ability to choose a dental option we recommend our comprehensive in-office Dental Savings Plan (DSP). Our program allows you to have all of your basic check-ups and cleaning services for the year for one low price. All other dental needs receive a 15% discount.

# Q: Are you in network with my insurance? (NEW PATIENT CALL)

A: "Let me be the first to welcome you to our practice. It is a pleasure to meet you by phone and I look forward to meeting you in person here real soon. Although we are not contracted with your insurance company directly we work with many patients who come to see us with your same insurance plan. We have a team dedicated to insurance who will help you use your benefits to their fullest each year.

# Doctor/Patient OON Conversation

"Steve, I wanted to take a minute to give you some information about some important things that are happening in the practice this year. We have done a lot of research over the past few years and have made the very difficult decision to relinquish our preferred provider status with your dental insurance company starting (date).

Every one of our patients is extremely important to us, you are extremely important to us, which is why I wanted to have this conversation with you personally. Working with (Ins Company Name) has been extremely time consuming, more restrictive, and more expensive for our patients. We simply cannot offer the quality of care that we insist on by remaining in your plan's network and we will never compromise the quality of your dental care.

The good news is that you can continue to come to our office. We have set things up to still estimate and submit claims to your carrier on your behalf just as we always have. Your day-to-day visits will be the same and we will continue to do everything we can to help you maximize your insurance benefits each year should you choose to stay with your same carrier.

I also want to make you aware of our cost-effective in-office Dental Savings Program (DSP). If you would like to change your dental plan or ever find yourself without dental insurance we would love to have you in our program. We are sending a few pieces of information home with you today that provide some further information. I encourage you to read through them when you have time."

What questions do you have?"

# Q: Will it cost me more to come to the office?

A: Honestly, we don't know. It is entirely possible that it will cost you a little bit more. With some plans there is virtually no change for you the patient. Either way, we hope that you will appreciate the relationship we have built over time, the quality of the dentistry performed here, the approach to care where we would never recommend something that is not in your best interest, and the individual attention with personal touches. We hope that those things are reason enough to continue to allow us to care for your dental needs.

# Helpful Verbiage for Threatening Insurance Companies

# Credentialing Departments

- Cigna -- (800) 537-8204
- MetLife -- (866) 438-5472
- Aetna - (800) 451-7715
- United Health care - (800) 445-9090
- UMR - Customer Service number is (877) 217-7800

Yes this issue with Connection that you described is a major issue for anyone dropping any umbrella network. Here is what I recommend you do:

1. Have your Connection Termination acknowledgement letter (that includes your actual Connection Dental termination date) prepared in a pdf copy.
2. Send that letter to any insurance plan that is paying you in-network under Connection and demand that they perform an audit going back to the Connection termination date to reprocess all claims that were incorrectly paid in-network.
3. Warn the dental plan that if they do not comply with this request that you will bring forward legal action and will report their fraud to the State Insurance Commissioner, Department of Justice that oversees ERISA dental plans, and your State Attorney General's Insurance Fraud division. With this warning every insurance plan usually works quickly to correct claims to out of network status as they do not want to deal with government regulators that will impose additional fines for violating insurance laws on the state and federal level.

Follow up with emails with the supervisor so you have time stamped proof.

Work your way up the chain of command.

Once you have a point of contact send them the EOB directly when they make a mistake.

“I need your first and last name and a reference number for your call, please direct me to your supervisor…”

“If we do not receive payment for this claim within 7 business days we will instruct the patient to file a claim with the state insurance board, thank you.”

“We have made a claim to the state insurance board and your late payment will result in interest charges.”

# Verbiage for patient questions re: insurance and treatment plans/claims

# DOWNGRADED CROWNS

Q: My plan says they cover crowns at 50%, but I’m looking at my treatment plan and it looks like they are not paying 50%?

A: I’d be happy to look into that for you! Upon checking your benefits, it looks like your insurance plan “downgrades” crowns. Our providers use the best materials available, so you’ll be receiving a porcelain/ceramic crown. However, insurance companies like to save themselves money by only paying for the least costly materials. They will base their payment on the cost of a metal crown instead, which ends up being less than 50% of our contracted rate for a porcelain crown.

# DOWNGRADED FILLINGS

Q: My plan covers fillings at 80%, but I’m looking at my treatment plan and it looks like I have to pay more than 20%?

A: I’d be happy to look into that for you! Upon checking your benefits, it looks like your insurance plan “downgrades” fillings. Our providers use the best materials available, so you’ll be receiving a composite, or tooth colored, filling. However, insurance companies like to save themselves money by only paying for the least costly materials. They will base their payment on the cost of an amalgam/silver filling, which ends up being less than 80% of our contracted rate for the composite filling.

# DELTA “MAC” PLANS

Q: My plan says I get two free exams and cleanings, why do I owe anything for this visit?

A: That’s a great question. Our office participates with your Delta Dental plan at the “Premier level”. While your plan will pay toward your visit here, it looks like they will only pay the amount for seeing a “PPO level” provider, and then you pay the difference.

# UHC DENIED A PATIENT’S CROWN/BUILDUP/ BRIDGE

Situation: a patient’s crown was denied by United Healthcare. Either we need to send an appeal, or the appeal has been denied and now the patient owes balance.

YOU WANT TO PASS THIS CONVERSATION OVER TO INGRID OR AMY. DON’T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE PATIENT WHY THEIR CROWN WAS DENIED, OR FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE IN AN APPEALS PROCESS, ETC. JUST TRANSFER THE CALL TO INGRID/AMY, OR TAKE A MESSAGE.

A: It looks like your UnitedHealthcare plan did not pay for your crown (and/or buildup) as we had expected. I know that United Healthcare really doesn’t like to pay for crowns, but our insurance coordinators are very thorough with our claims process so they’re probably already working on an appeal. Let me see if Ingrid or Amy are available to chat with you about your claim.
---
# How to Avoid Over-explaining

# 1. LESS IS MORE

- a. When you over explain it’s because you have a fear that they won’t believe you, so you give more detail in hopes that they will believe you know what you’re talking about.
- b. The more words you use to tell the truth, the less believable it sounds.
- c. When you give more detail, you aren’t preventing misunderstanding, you’re ensuring it.

# 2. DON’T ASSUME THEIR QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT

- a. If they want to know, they will ask. If they have a question, they will ask.
- b. Instead of being a waterfall of information, be a well.

# 3. Next time you find yourself using the word “Because”, ask yourself: DID THEY ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION, OR DO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY NEED IT?

- a. If it’s because you feel like it, you can probably do better without it.

***The following section is from a training that we did with our front office team. It is a great onboarding training for any front office team member. It is also a good one to review annually or semi-annually.

# Front Office Team Training

- ● Verbiage
- ● Case Presentation
- ● Phone Tips
- ● Navigating Difficult Insurance Conversations
- ● Diverting Long Conversations
- ● Redirecting contrast patients

# Verbiage

- ● It’s about WHAT we say & HOW we say it
- ● Don’t ask questions…

185
---
○ Avoid: Yes or No Questions - it is harder to come back and take control of the conversation when you do not get the answer you want or expect

■ “Do you have any questions?” vs “What questions do you have for me?”

● NEVER EVER EVER talk about PPO vs. Premier on a NP call - they have no clue what you’re talking about - if you find out they’re PPO only later - you call them back & have this convo

# Other Verbiage to Avoid

- CAN’T & UNFORTUNATELY instead say FORTUNATELY, I have great news
- Avoid talking about fee schedules - people don’t know what you’re talking about
- Avoid getting wrapped up in insurance conversations, let’s not forget the value we bring to the patient
- Never say the schedule is wide open- specify a couple times (start by offering the same time and day the next week)

# Treatment Presentation Fundamentals

- Avoid Word Vomit - power in some silence
- Speak Confidently and Clearly
- Creating Urgency
- Goal is same day Tx (if time allows- they are already here, saves a trip, saves practice money, etc.)
- Avoid Overwhelming the patient (prioritizing- can present 1st priority only if they seem very overwhelmed)
- Whenever someone offers you $ take it
- - Pre collect if we can - do not give option

Collecting
- - “It will be nine-ninety-eight today…” (do not say dollars)

If we take care of a patient don’t be afraid to take credit for it

# Presenting Treatment

# Smaller Treatment Plan (which will be completed in 1 visit)

- Present all the treatment, MUST still re-iterate Urgency
- Goal: Same Day or Get patient scheduled within 1-2 weeks with Doctor

# Power in Silence

186
---
# Very Large Treatment Plan

- Once treatment has been prioritized…
- Avoid overwhelming the patient “Foot in the door”
- “Dr. Alex’s biggest concern is this first priority, we definitely want to get that taken care of right away, we find it best to focus on getting this done & then follow up with next steps…”
- Power in Silence
- Helping block things together - explaining you only have to get numb once if we get half SRP and fillings together
- Use oral sedation/ nitrous to help patients with dental anxiety- it is a great service
- If they do say no- ask pt if we can follow up with them in a few weeks (add to audit list)

# Getting over Fears of talking about $$$

- Remember- you did not create this problem - you are offering a solution
- This problem will never get cheaper for the patient than it is today- you advocating for them to get it done now is your greatest ability to save them $
- The problem is not going away by you avoiding the $ convo
- Avoid making assumptions about the patient’s financial situation and their feelings about $, what they consider “expensive” etc
- - Don’t offer/bring up payment plans unless the patient asks

Don’t project your own personal view on $ & finances on the patient (It’s a free country and their choice how they want to spend their $)

# Breaking up Payments - Collecting

1. GOAL- Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan
3. In office payment plan- 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments- need proper paperwork
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford

# Example verbiage when patient accepts treatment, declines NG

“Apparently these guys don’t believe in preventing future damage and costs so they’re not going to pay for your NG but FORTUNATELY you do get a discount and as Dr. X discussed this is really going to help protect your teeth long term”

“So let’s go ahead and get you scanned for the NG ….”

Or

“Let’s go ahead & get you schedule for X tx and that NG”

187
---
# Phone Tips

- Take a deep breath & SMILE
- Avoid rabbit holes, take control of the conversation
- Don’t get caught answering all of the questions, you need to lead the conversation
- TONE: match their tone - volume & speed
- AVOID - word vomit / too much info
- Communication is 55% non-verbal so on the phone all we have is 38% our tone and 7% the words we use
- Group Phone Training Idea: pick mostly good ones and a few bad ones and sit around and critique each other - make it fun!

# Common “difficult” phone call themes

- Patient Asks right away “Do you take my insurance”
- YOUR RESPONSE “I can absolutely help you with that, who can we thank for referring you to our office?”
- Patient calls to cancel &lt;48 hours notice
- YOUR RESPONSE “Ohhh, can I ask what’s going on?”
- “Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”
- How much does a crown cost
- YOUR RESPONSE “I can absolutely help you with that…”
- Goal: Create Value & Get them in for a consult with the doctor
- Do not give exact $ amounts for cost of tx we have not diagnosed

# Chapter 10

# Accounts Receivable

As we look at the accounts receivable, the money owed to us, sometimes we start to become concerned about these levels. It’s understandable to become worried as they grow, but sometimes these are within normal ranges. As we go through this chapter, we will give you resources to help keep the accounts receivable (AR) in normal ranges. This includes Patient Trackers, Letters, and systems for refunds.

1. Patient AR tracker
2. 90 & 120 day balances
3. Bad Debt Letters
4. Outstanding Balance
5. Small Balance Agreement
6. Patient Credits and Refunds
7. AR
1. Rules of Thumb
2. &lt; 60 days —--> Goal 85%
3. 61-90 days —-> Goal 10%
4. &gt;90 Days —--> Goal 5%
8. How to tackle an AR problem?
1. It starts up stream with good ins breakdowns, good treatment estimates and collecting at time of services or better yet pre-collecting
2. Insurance AR- check appeals, resubmissions
3. Patient AR- tackle 0-60 day first
1. 90 day + AR start thinking writeoffs or collection agency
9. What do I do when insurance doesn’t pay what we expected & I have to go back to the patient for $$$?
1. This conversation is easier when we are proactive - it’s not good enough to just tell the patient that in the fine print we told you “this is just an estimate”
2. Why is insurance denying the claim or paying the improper amount?
1. Do we need to appeal? Insurance companies make many mistakes in their favor
2. Did we fail to give patient an accurate breakdown? (missing tooth clause?)

189
---
# iii. Do we need to provide more information? Additional X-rays, Photos, Narrative

c. At this point in time - it is a good idea to update the patient that their insurance company is behaving badly & our team is fighting on their behalf to get the claim paid - “we just want to keep you in the loop” - make chart notes on these updates

d. If insurance denies again - get the patient involved - “it’s us against them…Mrs. Jones what I’ve seen here is sometimes when you get involved we can get them to pay and avoid you having to pay this amount out of pocket

e. Ultimately it’s the patient’s responsibility - I have traditionally not nickel & dimed patients - example: x-ray or exam frequencies- we eat it. Missing tooth clause we may split the difference with the patient, crown freq. Limitation we may put it back on patient to fight the prior office.

# Forgiving a balance at end of year that is uncollectable

Dear PATIENT NAME,

This letter is to serve as a notice that your outstanding balance of $_______ has been excused. Repeated attempts to collect your balance during the course of the last year have been unsuccessful. In order to efficiently continue to provide our patients with affordable and quality dental services, Blue Dental has found it necessary to excuse your balance in order to offset the additional high administration costs associated with monthly statement processing and mailing. In closing, Dr. Blue and staff want to wish you and yours the best in 2021. We hope that the new year is more prosperous for you than 2020. With the country's economic situation the way it is, we can only guess that you have been adversely impacted. It is for this reason that we are excusing your outstanding balance. We know hardship must have forced you to neglect our payment especially after we already delivered in good faith, the dental services you required. Blue Dental has and will always consider you a valued patient and thank you for continuing to refer us to your friends and family for quality dental services.

# Bad debt write off: Example #2

Dear ____________,

I do hope that this letter finds you and your family well, it serves as an information and update for you and does not at this time require a response to us.

# Post EOB payment, balance due conversation

“Hi Joe! I am calling today to chat with you about your account real quick, do you have a couple of minutes for me?”

“Fantastic, thank you so much for that. You may have received notification from your INS co as well, we did receive your INS payment recently and I wanted to make you aware of what that looks like. After their payment it has left you with a patient account balance of $____________. I wanted to ensure that this wasn’t a surprise to you when I send out statements and you receive yours.”

Allow silence

Allow the patient to ask questions or go into what they need

Do not try to guess what they need & offer things that they may not need

(pt questions the estimate given) “As you may know, we make every attempt possible to obtain accurate INS benefits prior to your appt’s; occasionally that information given to us isn’t complete or has been misquoted by the representative. I wanted to let you know that in your case, the information that was estimated to us was off some and has left a balance on your account.”

Allow silence

“We do understand that this is an unexpected balance and we’re happy to do what we can to help with the situation; if you are able to, I’d love to collect a portion over the phone today to credit towards the balance and then I can send a statement for the remainder in a few weeks - does this option work for you today?”

# Billing & Payment Plans

In today’s world, it is becoming quite common to purchase things now, and pay for them later. With purchases of almost any amount on the internet, there’s offers to pay over the course of time for small monthly payments. With larger purchases like cars, almost 100% of buyers choose to finance their purchases.

In Dentistry, we should be offering the same financial terms for many of the large items we treatment plan. This chapter will help explain the strategies and tactics around executing more payment plans in your dental office.

# How to Enter a Payment/EOB in Open Dental

1. EOBs and payments can be received in multiple forms
1. Checks - will arrive via snail mail
2. Digital Credit Cards - can arrive via snail mail or Fax (will come to our email inbox)
3. EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) - will go directly deposited to our bank account
1. Log in to the Bank of America website, and review transactions from the previous business day(s), write them down according to the date posted.
2. Scan all EOB images and checks, or download from ins website/Dental Exchange, etc
3. ADD EOB DOCUMENT TO PT CHART, IF APPLICABLE
1. If the EOB is for just ONE patient (okay if it’s more than one date of service), add the EOB document to patient’s chart in the Images Module
1. Under EOB_Billing, label as “EOB:xx.xx.xx” with DOS. If patient has dual insurance, add “_primary / secondary / ins company name” as well
2. If the EOB is for more than one patient (even if they’re all in the same family), DO NOT upload the EOB to the patient’s chart images as this cause a potential HIPAA violation.
1. A batch EOB will be added to the claim in another way so that it can be accessed when needed.
4. FIND CLAIM UNDER “ACCOUNTS” MODULE
1. If the EOB is the first payment we are receiving for the DOS, the claim will be marked as “Sent”, and show up in RED, so easy to locate. If the payment is an additional payment per an appeal/correction, the claim will already be marked as “received”, and changed to a brown color.
2. Double click to open the claim
5. SPLIT CLAIM IF NEEDED (disclude denied services)
1. Review the payment received on the EOB document. If any services that we expected payment from show up as denied/unpaid/need additional information before payment can be made, highlight those services (use “Ctrl” button if more than one) and then click the “Split Claim” button in the upper right.
1. This will only need to be done if we are going to send additional info or an appeal - leaving it as “sent” rather than marking received allows for easier tracking of an unpaid claim!
6. UPDATE CLAIM STATUS (for services that have been paid)
1. In the upper left, click the dropdown menu, and change the Claim Status from “Sent” to “Received”
2. Enter the Date Received
1. For a check or digital credit card payment, use today’s date
2. For an EFT, use the date the payment was posted to our Bank of America account (usually 1 or 2 business days prior to today)
---
# 7. ENTER PAYMENT AMOUNTS

1. Upper Right section to Enter Payment, select “By Procedure” button
2. The list of all procedures will open, showing the Fee amount, billed to insurance,
Deductible, Allowed, Ins Paid, and Writeoff amounts.
1. The Fee and Billed to Insurance amounts should be identical, and reflect our full
office fees
1. These amounts cannot be changed - if they do not match, adjustments
may have to be made to the patient’s account after posting payment to
correct the errors
2. The Deductible amount will auto populate to reflect our treatment plan
estimates
1. This amount CAN be changed, if the deductible did/didn’t get applied to
the claim when we didn’t expect it, or if the amount was applied to a
different specific service than we thought, etc
2. Update the deductible applied amounts to match exactly what is shown
on the EOB from insurance
3. The Allowed Amount should be the contracted fee for service (i.e. Delta,
Careington, Zelis), and equals the billed to insurance amount minus write-off
amount
1. If a claim is processed as Out of Network, the allowed amount will be
our office fees if write-off is zero
2. This amount does NOT autopopulate when you enter the EOB. Note that
every insurance company’s EOB looks different. Some will specifically list
the allowed amount, some will only show the billed amount and the
write-off amount, so you have to do your own math
4. The Insurance Paid amount reflects exactly what insurance paid for each service
1. Just like the deductible amounts, the paid amount WILL auto populate
for you based on our treatment planned estimates, but should be
scrutinized for accuracy and changed as needed to match the EOB
2. If a paid amount differs from what we expected, make a note in the
“Remarks” section
1. I.e. “Annual maximum reached”, “frequency limitation”, “age
limit”, “not a covered service”, “downgraded to amalgam”
3. Verify that all column totals (billed amount, allowed amount, paid amount, writeoffs) all
match those on the EOB!
4. Once you’ve confirmed that all payment amounts look correct, click “OK” in lower right
corner

# 8. MAKE NOTE OF PATIENT OWED AMOUNT & OTHER IMPORTANT PROCESSING NOTES

1. In the “Reasons Underpaid” section, add a line that says “Pt portion = x”
1. This amount should ideally be what is shown on the EOB (i.e. If Delta EOB shows
patient portion is $39 for fluoride, write “pt portion = 39” even though we end
up adjusting off $9 as a courtesy for the patient
---
1. If pt portion differs between the EOB and our treatment plan, you may need to note “Honor TP pt portion = X”
2. If patient maxes out their insurance with this claim, also add a line that says “ANNUAL MAX REACHED”
3. Other notes can be made if needed (i.e. “frequency limitation for exams”, or other remarks you may have already noted when entering payment amounts)
4. If the patient has a secondary insurance plan, do not make note of pt portion until all claims has been processed
5. Click “Okay” in lower right corner
1. At this point, you can still go back and make any edits to the claim if needed

# 9. “FINALIZE” PAYMENT

1. If you are working on a Batch/Bulk payment that includes more than one patient, or multiple DOS for the same patient, repeat steps 4-8 for each individual claim before finalizing the payment
1. Account module will now show a line for insurance payment on the claim that says “PAYMENT NEEDS TO BE FINALIZED”
2. Once all claims have been entered for a batch, open any one of the included claims and click “+ Batch” button under Finalize Payment, located near the middle of the claim screen.
3. If you are working on a single claim, click the “+This Claim Only” button, located directly underneath the Batch button
1. If all you have been working on is one claim, nothing will differ if you happen to click the “Batch” button instead of “This Claim Only”.
2. BUT, If you have been working on a batch, but you click “This Claim Only”, your payment details will be only for that one specific claim, and will be incorrect as the amounts won’t match, and payment will not attach to any of the other claims.
1. The only time you’d select “This Claim Only” while working on a batch EOB would be to make note of a claim that has NO PAYMENT. In this case you will want to do this in order to still attach the EOB to the claim.

# 10. ENTER PAYMENT DETAILS

1. “Type”: select payment type from dropdown. Default is Check, can be changed to EFT or Digital Credit Card accordingly
2. “Posting Date”: same rules apply here as with “Received date” for the claim, but the date will default to today’s date so be sure to change this for EFTs!
3. “EFT Issue Date”: you can leave this blank
4. “Check #”: use the number on the check, EFT or digital credit card, may be noted as “transaction number”. Will be the same number for all claims associated with a bulk payment
5. “Bank-Branch”: the initials of the person posting this payment
6. “Note”: For digital credit cards, you’ll come back and paste the Flex payment transaction number here. Otherwise this section is only needed if there is something out of the ordinary with the receipt of this payment.
---
1. Confirm that the total payment amount matches that on the check/EFT/Credit Card
1. Sometimes the amount on a check from Metlife will not match the amount on the EOB if any adjustments have been made to an original payment, or it is a secondary claim, etc.
2. If amounts do not match, review to find the discrepancy. Do not finalize a payment that does not have correct amounts
2. Click Okay to confirm payment amount
3. Review the list of patients included on the batch payment
1. Every patient/claim should be included on a separate line
4. Review for a final time that payment amount and other details are accurate

# 11. ATTACH EOB TO CLAIM

1. In the Lower Left corner of the payment screen you’ll see a line that says “EOB is Scanned: No”
2. Click the “Scan EOB” button
3. Import EOB document - you can attach more than one document to the payment if needed. Also, make sure you are attaching the correct EOB if you are working on a batch of multiple EOBs ;)
1. This step is SO important because if a claim is part of a batch payment, this is the only place you’ll be able to come back and reference the EOB.
4. Close the Import Image screen (X in upper right corner)
5. Lower Left screen should now show “EOB is Scanned: Yes”
6. Click Okay

# 12. YOU’RE DONE WITH THIS CLAIM/PAYMENT!*

1. Claim will now reflect as Received (brown instead of red)

*Unless you need to make other adjustments to the claim, or post the digital credit card payment via Flex, or send an appeal/additional information to insurance, send a , etc…

# Payment

We require that payment be rendered on the date of service. We will estimate the amount of copay required from the information that your insurance company provides to us. Please keep in mind that we make every effort that these estimates are accurate, we cannot possibly be correct 100% of the time due to the many clauses and stipulations that are inherent in the individual policies. In other words, every policy is unique, and the estimate is not a contract.

# Underpayment by Insurance

In the case that your insurance company pays less than we estimate, you will be responsible for the balance.

# Small Balance Policy

In the instance that there is a balance (less than $100) left on your account, in the event that insurance underpaid, you will receive a statement with a reminder of the balance reflected will be posted to the card on file below.

|Credit Card Number|_________________________|
|---|---|
|Expiration Date|_______________|
|CVC|________|
|Billing Zip Code|___________|

By signing below you confirm that you have read our financial policy and consent to us drafting the credit card on file to take care of the unpaid balance less than $100. We will contact you before ever charging anything to your credit card in case you would like to make another arrangement.

# Patient Refund Check Protocol

- Identify that there is a TRUE credit on the account. How to tell if this is the case:
- All pending insurance claims have been paid/settled (“InsEst” should be 0)
- Patient Balance (“Est Bal”) is a negative amount
- There should be a pop-up or commlog note stating that this is a true credit
- First check to see if the patient or any family members have pending treatment (either scheduled on or their treatment plans) that the credit can be used toward
- If you have a conversation with a patient either over the phone or in person and they inquire about receiving a refund check
- Tell the patient “Great, I will let our financial coordinator know and she can look into getting you that refund check! She only issues these checks on a few specific days in the month so it may not be processed for a few weeks. Would you like to have that mailed to you, or would you like to pick it up at your upcoming appointment (if applicable)? Great, can I please verify that we have your correct address on file?”
- Log the patient’s name on the “Patient Credit/Refund Check Requests” Google Spreadsheet. Include Pt name, date you spoke to pt and your initials, note that they want a refund check, and add notes regarding the conversation w/ the patient. Please be sure to note if you confirmed the pt’s address.
- ADD A COMM LOG NOTE in Open Dental regarding your conversation with the patient

# Issuing Checks (On the 5th & the 20th of the Month)

- Office Manager & Financial Coordinator will review patient refund spreadsheet.
- Write a check for the appropriate amount, and log in the black “checkbook”
- Have Dr. Blue approve & sign the check
- Scan a copy of the check into pts images
- Upload scan, and file under the “Financial Agreement” section
- Label as “Pt Refund Check # ____”
- Add/Log refund check in patients Account Module
---
# Add Payment

- You will put this in as a NEGATIVE PMT
- Make a CommLog note that check was mailed:
- EXAMPLE: Verified address on file was correct and mailed refund check #1160 in the amount of $122.24 to pt. Eh
- {MAILED PT REFUND CHECK #_ IN THE AMOUNT OF $_ TO PT} kr
- Print a “Walkout” Statement to show that the patient has a 0.00 balance on account, and put it in the envelope along with a check.
- Then mail check :)

Hi ___, this is Ingrid with Blue Dental Care. Our office has received the refund check from our bank for the credit on your account. You are welcome to come by the office during business hours to pick it up, or if you would prefer to have it mailed to you, we simply ask that you please confirm your mailing address. You can text us back at this number, or give us a call at 720-XXX-XXXX. Thank you!

# FLEX BILLING Protocol: How to send an Invoice/Statement

As always, use your best judgment before sending an electronic statement to someone who may not even have a cell phone or email address they use frequently. The alternative option is to send a paper statement via snail mail.

# Determining if patient has a balance to be paid:

- A patient’s EOB/ Insurance payment is received for a claim and the payment is entered. The account should ideally be evaluated for a balance the SAME DAY, and the statement should be sent as soon as possible, if appropriate.
- Assess-
1. Have all claims been paid for this patient’s account?
2. Are there any outstanding insurance issues or claims that require resolution?
3. If the account has other family members, do other members have outstanding credits or balances to be evaluated?
- If a patient (and/or family) have a true balance to the account- a statement needs to be sent via FLEX. The patient will receive a request for payment via text/email as soon as the statement is created.
- If the patient has a LARGE account balance (usually $200 or more), call the patient first so they are not blindsided by receiving a large bill from our office.
---
# In FLEX: Creating an Invoice

- Login to FLEX &gt; Should be directed to the “Home” page
- Search for the patient
- (Flex does not combine balances between family members, so be sure to select the actual family member with a balance - statements will be sent to/addresses to the parent/guarantor for children. If more than one family member has a balance, you’ll need to send separate statements for each of them)
- Click the $ symbol to Send Statement
- An itemized list of all visits/charges will come up for the patient
- If previous statements for a specific service have been sent, you’ll see the last sent date.
---
● If needed, you have the option to click the upper right icon to “Filter to Balance Only”

● Select the desired/appropriate line items.

● The amount due will be calculated at the bottom of the screen. If that amount matches the total balance due in the patient’s Open Dental account, you’re ready to send

● NOTE: You can only send a statement through Flex if the patient has an outstanding balance. If you are simply trying to send the patient an itemized receipt/statement, you’ll need to do so via Open Dental.

● Select the icon at the bottom of the screen for how you’d like to send the bill (Email/Text)

- ○ I usually send the email statement first, and if it seems appropriate (patient’s age, time of day, etc) I then follow up by sending the statement via text.

● You’ll get a screen previewing the message that will be sent to the patient.
---
If sending via TEXT, you can use the following message:

{TEXT FOR BALANCE ON ACCOUNT FROM LAST APPOINTMENT}

# How to Collect Payments In-Office

Collect payment through FLEX either on the iPad or Desktop

- Find Patient on FLEX by searching or by scrolling to the date of service
- Once you have located the patient click on the picture of a credit card
- When you click on the Card a popup window will appear prompting you to enter the payment amount. Once you have entered the correct amount you will press the button that says “Pay”.

218
---
● After you have pressed the “Pay” button the Credit Card machine located at the front desk will prompt you to insert or slide the card. Once you do this it will ask you to remove the card and the screen will say approved.

● If the payment is approved flex will ask you if you would like to send a receipt. The patient's email address on their OpenDental account will automatically be loaded into the FLEX receipt option, press send and bring the card back to the patient and you're done.

If the patient does not have the card present we can obtain the card number, expiration date and security code from the back. Perform all the steps listed above but instead of sliding or inserting the card you will have to press cancel on the credit card machine. When you hit cancel FLEX will ask you if you want to “Retry” or “Enter Manual”, select the Manual option and enter the card information the patient gave to you.

# INVISALIGN Financial Arrangements

It has been our experience that invisalign is often an impulse buy. With that said we need to be able to quickly discuss financial options. We prefer the doctor grab this financial options sheet and sit shoulder to shoulder with the patient to discuss (this is following the presentation of how invisalign works and we know the patient is very interested in treatment). When they say “I need to think about it or talk to my spouse we have them take a photo.

Ideally we already know whether or not they have adult ortho coverage. The one side of this laminated sheet shows the cost in the event they have ortho coverage and the other side is with no ortho coverage. If they have more than $2,000 in ortho coverage then we just tell them how great that is and that their fee will be even lower than depicted here. Then the treatment coordinator has a binder with pre-printed financial arrangements for all of the ortho payment scenarios. They can quickly rip out the appropriate financial arrangement and bring that to the patient to sign and collect payment. We prefer this to the generic open dental print out because we have flexible payment options that aren’t quickly or easily depicted inside open dental. The Treatment Coordinator would scan the signed FA into the chart and make commlog notes about the financial arrangement discussion. When a patient leaves they would enter the in office payment plan in open dental if appropriate.

Note the disclaimer regarding clarity on what type of retainers you will be giving them and if they are bruxers the potential additional cost of a night guard if they crack retainers. People will feel like you are “up-charging” them if you aren’t clear about this on the front end.

Additionally, we have a disclaimer regarding if someone changes insurance coverage and loses ortho benefits because typically ortho insurance companies pay a little bit each month throughout treatment rather than a lump sum. (Note: We discuss checking for ortho coverage in the insurance verification section). We also make patients aware that if they relocate there could be additional fees for transferring the case. This gives us flexibility to a variety of ways this could play out.

# MATERIAL/COSMETIC UPGRADE SERVICE AGREEMENT

At times our doctor(s) may recommend materials which are above and beyond what is covered by your Insurance Company, and/or included as a standard per the Current Dental Terminology as represented by the American Dental Association.

When the doctor feels the presented necessary treatment can be improved to create a more stationary restoration by utilizing an upgraded material, he/she will advise you to choose the upgraded materials as recommended.

As always, our doctor’s number one concern is to treat you with the most advanced material and services available to improve the outcome and longevity of a healthy smile.

“I understand the doctor has my best interest in mind. At this time, I am accepting upgraded materials at my doctor’s recommendation to better treat my present condition(s). I understand the upgrade of the materials, above and beyond what is covered by my insurance company, which can generate additional charges due over the standard fees agreed upon with my insurance company or dental network.”

# Payment Plan Protocol

- If a patient is interested in setting up a payment plan in-office, you MUST make sure you have a good feeling about the patient. An In-Office payment plan translates to Blue Dental Care being “the bank,” and we are taking the risk and the “word” the patient will pay. IF YOU DO NOT GET A GOOD FEELING ABOUT A PATIENT, DO NOT SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN FOR THEM. There are other options (CareCredit, Proceed Finance)
- Payment plans should be set up following these parameters:
- Invisalign: $1400 down payment (due at the time Invisalign is accepted) and 9 equal payments to be deducted Monthly.
- Cosmetic or Large Cases: 30% down payment (due at the time case is accepted) and 9 equal payments to be deducted Monthly.
- Restorative Treatments - MUST HAVE A SIGNED COPY OF PAYMENT PLAN AUTHORIZATION
- In-Office Payment Plan: 50% due at the time of service, followed by a MAXIMUM of 4 equal payments to be deducted monthly. Use this form: Payment Plan Terms
- Half Now/Half on Seat Date - Use this form HALF AND HALF PAYMENT PLAN / Crown & Bridge 2 Payments Agreement
- A CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION FORM MUST BE FILLED OUT WITH TWO CREDIT CARDS!!!!
- Setting up a payment plan in Open Dental
- First, apply the down payment to the patient’s account, you will want to apply this down payment to the services rendered.
- While in the account, click on Payment Plan > Patient Payment Plan
- You will enter the total treatment amount LESS the down payment, the down payment has already been applied to the services, this DOES NOT get included in the payment plan.
- Enter the number of payments (4 or 9)
---
1. Select “View TX Credits” > select the Procedures to be included in the payment plan > once the procedures have been highlighted, click Add. The “total credits attached” will equal the payment plan total amount.
2. If these amounts match, click OK in the Payment Plan Procedures and Credits box. Then click “Create Schedule” and the Amortization Schedule will populate.
3. The payment plan is now set up in Open Dental, it ALSO needs to be added in FLEX.
---
1. On the FLEX website, click the $ Icon > select the Recurring Payments header
2. Select NEW PLAN > Type the Patient’s name, then click the “Link to Payment Plan” dropdown box, the Patient’s Payment plan will populate with the same breakdown as is set up in Open Dental.
3. The credit card info will need to be entered manually. Select “USE NEW CARD” > Enter both credit cards manually. Now the payment plan is set up completely.
4. If the card was input correctly, the Card reader will show “Declined,” however, in FLEX the screen will read “The Card has been captured successfully, you may close this window.”
5. Take a picture of the signed Payment Plan agreement to add to the Patient’s imaging (Save in Financial Agreement), and place the Agreement in the Payment Plan Folder
6. Lastly, add the payment plan to the Payment Plan Tracker

# Pre-Collection Protocol

1. GOAL- Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan
3. In office payment plan- 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments- need proper paperwork
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford

# When do we pre-collect for an appointment?

- ANY restorative appointment with Dr. Blue, no matter the length
- ALL sedation appointments
- For any appointment 1 hour or more with any provider(s) - Dr. Alex, Dr. Amanda, Hygienists (i.e: Fillings, Crowns, SRP, Implants, RCT’s, Sedation, EXT):
- GOAL is to pre-collect for FULL patient portion in advance
- At a minimum we MUST pre-collect $100 per hour for the reserved appointment
- IF the patient portion for this appointment is less than the “deposit”, then we must pre-collect patient portion in FULL

# Helpful Verbiage to use with patients

- “Dr. Blue has limited clinical hours and he does often book out several weeks in advance. so we take a deposit/pre-payment to reserve that spot for you.”
- “Normally we’d collect $100 per hour to reserve that time with Dr.Blue, but since your patient portion ends up as less than that, we can just collect the full $XX.XX”.
- To assure we allot the appropriate appointment time with Dr. Blue, we do require a deposit of $100 per hour to reserve this time with him.
- No matter how full the schedule is in reality, we want to indicate that Dr. Blue’s time is limited and valuable.
- “Looks like we can squeeze you in with Dr. Blue on…”
- “We can make ___ work”
- Actually this is rare, that I will be able to get you in at this time with him on this day as he typically books these up first for this type of appointment.

# Sedation Appointments:

- “We collect in advance for sedation appointments since you/the patient will be sedated and there’s so many other things going on when you come back in”
- If you prefer, we can take a $300 deposit to hold the spot now. We will need your patient portion paid in full by the day before the appointment” (Friday if it’s a Monday appointment).
---
# SEDATION APPTS SHOULD BE PRE-COLLECTED IN FULL - NO EXCEPTIONS

EXAMPLE: Joe is scheduled on Monday at 2pm with Dr. Blue for #1-EXT, #2-OL, and #3-MOL. (1 hour appt) We would want to collect a $100 deposit, but the patient portion is estimated to be $68.20, so we will collect that in full.

TC: Joe, looks like I could squeeze you in at 2pm on Monday, February 17 with Dr. Blue?

Joe: Sure.

TC: Perfect! And I can go ahead and collect that $68.20 today, to reserve this appointment.

Joe: Can I just pay it the day of the appointment?

TC: Typically we require a deposit of $100 per hour for any reserved appointments, but we estimate that your patient portion for this appointment will only be $68.20, so I can just collect that.

Joe: Oh, okay (hands me his card)

TC: Thanks, Joe! Just keep in mind that we do require 48 business hours for any changes to this reserved appointment with Dr. Blue.

Joe: What happens if I call the day before because I get called into work?

TC: Oh, I would hate for that to happen. By chance if it does, we can just apply $50 of this deposit towards our appointment change fee.

Joe: Okay, thanks! I’ll let you know if anything changes.

TC: Sounds great, Joe! We look forward to seeing you at your reserved appointment with Dr. Blue on Monday, February 17th at 2pm.

Example: Rose is scheduled on Monday February 10th at 5pm for a 1 hour appointment with Dr. Blue for #3-Implant (placement). The patient portion is estimated to be $450.20. We would first try to collect $450.20, and at MINIMUM collect a $100 deposit to reserve this appointment.

TC: Rose, looks like I could squeeze you in at 5pm on Monday, February 17 with Dr. Blue?

Rose: Sure, I think I could make that work.

TC: Perfect! And I can go ahead and collect the $450.20 to reserve this appointment.

Rose: Oh no, that's okay. I will just pay for it that day.

TC: Absolutely, Rose. I will then just collect the $100 deposit to reserve this appointment, and you can pay your remaining estimated patient portion of the $350.20 on this date.

Rose: Why do you have to collect anything today?

TC: Rose, that is a great question! To assure we allot the appropriate appointment time with Dr. Blue we do require a deposit of $100 per hour to reserve this time with him. Actually this is rare, that I will be able to get you in at this time with him on this day as he typically books these up first for this type of appointment.

Rose: Okay, not a problem. I’ll go ahead and take care of it all now. (hands me the card)

TC: Thanks, Rose! Just keep in mind that we do require 48 business hours for any changes to an appointment. We look forward to seeing you that Monday, February 10th at 5pm with Dr. Blue.

Claim#:

Dear Claims Examiner,

We are asking for reconsideration of payment of the prophylaxis which was performed for [PATIENT NAME] on [DATE]. The patient was scheduled for a prophylaxis, but at the time of service we found evidence of active periodontal disease localized to tooth/teeth #__, requiring a limited SRP (D4342). The patient reports no prior history of periodontal treatment that would indicate future dental cleanings to be performed and billed out as a perio maintenance.

We have received payment for this limited scaling and root planing to account for the additional time, product, supplies, and resources that were used to provide this unscheduled scaling and root planing on [teeth #]. However, payment has been denied on the adult prophylaxis (D1110) and fluoride (D1206). After completing the limited scaling with root planing on tooth #__, additional time was still required to clean the rest of the patient’s mouth per our standard level of dental care. We are requesting compensation for the time and resources utilized to complete the patient’s prophylaxis and fluoride application as well.

# DELTA DENTAL SPECIFIC

While we are aware that the submission of a prophy (D1110) in conjunction with even one full quadrant of SRP (D4341) would be considered inclusive of the scaling and root planing procedure. However upon our review of the billing policies outlined in the Delta Dental Dentist Handbook, this is not a stipulation when submitting for a prophy in conjunction with limited SRP (D4342) on just one quadrant. We hope that you find this documentation satisfactory to reprocess the patient's claim for payment. If you have any additional questions please let me know. Thank you.

Patient: Tiffany Brady

Patient DOB: 06/13/1976

ID number: 934931868

Claim Number: 232084030100

Dear Claims Examiner,

I am sending A SECOND LEVEL APPEAL on behalf of our patient, Tiffany Brady, who was in our office on 11/06/2023, at which time we placed a crown (D2740) on tooth #31. After a first level appeal, United Healthcare has continued to reject payment for a crown on the tooth, and instead applied the inaccurate alternate payment for a filling. We are asking for corrected payment on this claim, as the reviewing dentist clearly overlooked our explanation of the treatment’s necessity.

The previous attempt to restore the tooth with a filling (on 9/8/2023) had already failed, and the tooth’s symptoms continued to persist, with a diagnosis of cracked tooth syndrome. (See the first appeal letter/narrative for more detail). Clinical guidelines indicate that a filling is insufficient treatment for cracked tooth syndrome. We must receive corrected treatment for a CROWN on tooth #31.

If there is going to be an ongoing problem with United Healthcare appropriately covering treatment for our patient, please have the reviewing dentist call me for a peer-to-peer review.

Sincerely,

Dr. Amanda Golden, Treating Dentist

# FIRST LEVEL APPEAL LETTER

UNITED HEALTHCARE

ATTN: Dental Appeals/Complaints

Patient: Tiffany Brady

Patient DOB: 05/18/1976

ID number: 934931868

Claim Number: 232084030100

Dear Claims Examiner,

I am sending additional information as requested on behalf of our patient, Tiffany Brady, who was in our office on 11/06/2023, at which time we placed a crown (D2740) on tooth #31. United Healthcare has denied payment for the crown, with no explanation. We are asking for reconsideration of payment, as the crown was dentally necessary.

DX: #31 CRACKED TOOTH SYNDROME

The patient presented with symptomatic tooth #31. On 09/08/2023, we placed a very large and deep MOBL composite filling on tooth #31 including the Cl V region. The decay approached the nerve and had been recommended more than a year beforehand. The patient returned to the office on 10/31/2023 reporting continued and increased sensitivity since the filling had been placed. She has a history of severe bruxism, and now notes pressure and pain to biting on #31 that is consistent with Cracked Tooth Syndrome. A bite test with tooth sleuth and percussion test was performed, and the patient responded abnormally to both. With the diagnosis of Cracked Tooth Syndrome, the definitive treatment is a crown. Furthermore, the patient was experiencing temperature sensitivity, another symptom of cracked tooth syndrome, which was resolved once pt was in temporary crown.
---
The existing restoration was removed, which approached the nerve of the tooth. As a measure in hopes of preventing the need for a future root canal, a pulp cap was placed at no charge to the patient or insurance. Likewise, while a buildup was required for retention of the crown, we did not charge it to either the patient or insurance, due to recent placement of the filling on the same tooth. Only the crown was billed to the patient and insurance, as the restorative treatment to address cracked tooth syndrome on #31. We hope that you find this documentation satisfactory to reprocess the patient's claim for payment. If you have any additional questions please let me know. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ingrid Monroe

# SRP Denial Protocol:

- Insurance verifier will receive documentation explaining why SRP was denied.
- Insurance verifier will let the hygienist know of the denial and set up a time to meet.
- Hygienist will review case and update more detailed documentation for narrative, use editing tool to measure bone loss, and/or circle visible deposits on radiograph with insurance verifier present so they can copy to claim.
- Hygienist may also need to help update narrative for bruxism if denial is for NG. If there were additional photos taken of pts recession and abfractions, hygienist may show insurance verifier so they can copy to claim as well.
- Insurance verifier will resubmit claim to insurance.

# Coding & Treatment

# Coordinator Tips

1. # Common Codes

This spreadsheet has been extremely valuable for our treatment coordinators. I have found, especially for procedures such as dentures, that if a TC just types in dentures into open dental to quickly search for a code, they could inadvertently pick the wrong type of denture. This is a quick reference that is laminated front and back and at the fingertips of our team. We have all seen the overwhelming size of the dental coding books, by formulating a spreadsheet like this, it is extremely rare that we would need to reference a code that isn’t on the spreadsheet, thus it saves our team a ton of time. Associates have also found this very useful. When we update fees annually I like to reference this sheet and rather than just increase by 5% a year across the board (which is totally fine and there is an easy way to update all fees 5% across the board in open dental which will save a bunch of time) BUT my preference has been to selectively decide on the fee increase per code. My reasoning is, for example if my denture fee is already in a good spot for case acceptance (maybe even a little high), why am I increasing that 5%. It works the opposite way too, if I find out my crown fee is 10% low for my area and I increase by 5%, why didn’t I increase it 10%? You will figure out what works best for your practice, but these are two ways to go about it. I also like this spreadsheet for comparing our UCR to insurance fee schedules. Occasionally we will run into a new umbrella network that has “better fees than we’re getting” and then you look at the details and some codes do pay better, yet some are worse, so you have to go a step further and look at the volume of those codes you do annually to properly weigh the impact.

# c. Dealing with treatment estimates

# i. How do we provide patients with an accurate estimate?

# ii. It starts with verification & what we enter in open dental

# iii. Treatment Coordinators have to watch out for

1. Downgrades, missing tooth clauses, frequency limitations, etc.

# iv. Verbiage - we must remind patients it is an estimate and that insurance companies play games, NOT US

# v. “I’m confident in our breakdown, but what I want to make us aware of is that there is ALWAYS a chance these guys come back and play games, I like to remind myself that whenever it comes to insurance it is an ESTIMATE”

# vi. Proper Coding

# vii. Prioritizing treatment for case acceptance

# 5. Implants

Patients NEVER remember the steps to an implant. We allow patients to pay ½ at placement and ½ at impression. Thus every time you go to collect for the abutment crown at the impression appointment, they always say “I already paid for my implant”. We print this out and clearly write out their patient responsibility at surgical placement and their responsibility at impression and they sign it. This then gets scanned into their chart and this is their copy.

# 6. Updating Fees annually

# a. Discussed above

# b. Additionally, when you update fees in open dental the treatment plans that were made prior to the fee update inside patients charts do not reflect the fee increase until you follow these steps. Now you may want to honor the fees for 90 days so you will have to determine how you will want to handle patients that were, for example, treatment planned at your old fees in December but have treatment in January after the fee increase.

# 7. Crown Downgrades

# 8. Coding Adjustments

# 9. “Dummy Codes”

# a. You can add no fee custom codes that are not billed to insurance and help with tracking. See some examples below. Additionally, you can add codes that have a fee associated with them and are not billed to insurance such as an additional lab fee for a gold crown and other examples below

# b. Examples:

1. CA &lt;48 hours
2. Itero Scan
3. Cosmetic Interest
4. DSP Adult
5. Endo Referral
6. Bite Adjustment
7. Much More- customize to your office needs.
---
# 8. A great way for follow up

Example if you have an ortho night & you’re tracking invisalign interest you can quickly pull a patient list.

# c. No Bill Insurance Upgrade Codes

1. Material upgrade fee (Invisalign)
2. Need to sign material upgrade form
3. Cosmetic Upgrade Fee (veneers)
4. Need material upgrade and request to restrict disclosure forms
5. Gold Upgrade
6. Quick Splint
7. All on X

# 10. Collections policy

Your TC must understand your expectations regarding collections here are our rules & in the order of priority:

1. Pre-Collecting & Collecting at time of service are the best way to combat patient AR issues.
2. Pre-Collect $100 / hour to “reserve” an appointment with doctor?
3. Will you accept paying ½ at prep & ½ at delivery in some cases?
4. What kind of wiggle room do you give your TC in the service of case acceptance?
5. In office financing options? Good or bad?
6. Third Party Financing

# 11. The Following “disclaimer” goes at the bottom of every printed open dental or Flex Treatment plan presented to patients

About YOUR insurance:

This is our best ESTIMATE not a GUARANTEE of benefits. The accuracy of this estimate is derived from the details you & your insurance have provided in regards to your relationship with them.

Common Insurance TRAPS you should know about but aren’t limited to:

- Frequency Limitations
- Missing Tooth Clauses
- Downgrades to SILVER fillings, metal crowns & Dentures!
- DENIALS for unexpected reasons
- DEDUCTIBLES applied randomly

BE PREPARED: Insurance companies create CONVOLUTED scenarios that may result in balances or credits on your account. Estimates are valid for 90 days.

I acknowledge that I have been informed of the above fees and proposed treatment. I understand that by not completing treatment, my oral condition may deteriorate and need reassessment in the future. We want you to know we do everything we can to help our patients maximize their insurance benefits, but we are not willing to lower the quality of care that you deserve, therefore, at times your treatment plan may include a “service fee” to cover the difference in cost and quality.

# Treating Provider Protocol

# Beginning of Day

- Prior to huddle, providers will look at the schedule together and make a plan of which hygiene exams they will do that day.
- The list of patients per provider will be shared with JB/Ingrid so that the correct provider can be assigned to the visits.
- If only one provider is working at a time, they will be the default provider for exams.
- If a hygiene visit does not include an exam, the patient’s primary provider may be left as the treating provider.

# During the Day

- When a patient is seen for an exam, the hygienist will find the provider who has been assigned to the visit.
- In the case that the provider is changed at time of service
- Hygienist will change the provider assigned to the visit in Open Dental
- Hygienist/Treatment Coordinator always circles the correct provider’s name at the top of the exam sheet!
- Dentists will also double check that they are appropriately assigned to any exams they do.
- Once visit is finished, before setting services as complete, hygienists will double check that correct treating provider has been assigned to each service and the visit overall.
- This includes the exam, as well as x-rays and fluoride - which may be assigned to either the dentist or the hygienist depending on who performed these tasks.
- Before submitting the claim, the hygienist or front office will ensure that the treating provider has been assigned.

# End of Day

- Dentists will review their production for the day and ensure that they were assigned to the correct patients.
- Dentists will assign themselves as the “Primary Provider” in the New Patient’s charts or if they treatment planned new services for an existing patient which they will perform.
- This will make it so that future visits will default with them as the treating provider.

# HOW TO MANUALLY CALCULATE TREATMENT PLANS IN OPEN DENTAL

# PATIENT COPAY INSURANCE PLANS

- If a patient has a copay plan, we have to look up the set copay patient owes for each service, and insurance pays the remainder up to contracted fee.
- You should find a breakdown of the faxback with copay amounts in the patient’s chart under Images - Insurance Card/Photos. Metlife copay amounts can also be found online.
- For this example, we’ll use the above highlighted service - a bundled copay of $60 for a Periodic Hygiene visit including exam, prophy, and bitewings. Assuming the patient is an adult, they’ll owe an additional $30 for fluoride. In the end our treatment plan will show an estimated patient portion of $90!
- The patient’s Insurance plan will be entered with the appropriate fee schedule, but coinsurance percentages set to 0% so the TC will be prompted to enter insurance estimates. Upon first entering treatment/services, it will show that the patient owes 100% of contracted fees.
---
●   Calculate the Insurance Estimate by subtracting patient copay amount from the contracted/allowable fee.

○   Example: periodic exam fee is $46, which is less than the full copay amount. Leave this line as-is, since it already estimates the patient will owe the full amount. The patient will owe the remaining $14 copay toward bitewings, and insurance will pay $41 ($55 - $14). Insurance will pay full $84 toward prophy, and $0 toward fluoride.

●   One by one you’ll double click on each line item to manually change the insurance estimate.

○   After the first double click, then double click on the Insurance Plan line below in the Insurance Estimates and Payments section. (If the patient has dual insurance, or there had been a preauth for these services already, there may be more than one line. Be sure to select the correct one).

●   Change the amount in the Insurance Estimate section, then click OK.

# INSURANCE PLAN PAYS OFF DIFFERENT FEE SCHEDULE

# (i.e. Cigna Advantage, Delta PPO vs. Premier, etc)

- Some insurance plans will pay off a lower fee schedule than our true contracted rates. Example:
- a Delta plan includes Premier coverage, however the plan only pays up to the PPO fee schedule amounts, and the patient will owe the difference. Or, a Cigna Advantage plan will pay up to their “MAC” Fee schedule, and the patient owes the difference up to our contracted rates under Careington fees.
- The insurance plan will be added to the patient’s chart with the correct coinsurance percentages, and set at our CONTRACTED fee schedule (the higher of the two)
- For this example, a Cigna Advantage Plan which is set to automate treatment estimates on the Careington fee schedule
- Under the Treatment module on the patient’s account, see the Careington fees, and estimates per that fee schedule, which need to be manually changed

261
---
●  Go back to the patient’s Insurance plan under the Family module and change the fee schedule to the one insurance will base their payments from (in this case, the Cigna Advantage MAC fees)

●  Go back to the Treatment module and click ‘Update Fees”. You’ll now see the amounts insurance is expected to pay.

●  Write down these insurance estimates for each individual service per the lower fee schedule.

- Exam = $25
- Bitewings = $32
- Prophy = $56

1. Once again, return to the insurance plan in the patient’s account and change the fee schedule back to the fee schedule we base treatment from (in this case, Careington).

# Route Slip Protocol

APPOINTMENTS TO BE SET COMPLETE BY THE PROVIDERS ONLY. DAs and FO do not set appt. complete.

271
---
# Front Office:

- At the end of day, make sure all appointments are set complete
- Confirm the provider before sending the claim (The provider will set the appointments complete)

# Hygiene:

- Set appointments complete when the patient leaves.
- Make sure the correct codes are attached to the appointment before setting complete to ensure claim is ready to be sent
- If Whitening or Fluoride is added to the current day appointment, add the codes before setting complete and collect the appropriate amount - if unsure of the correct patient portion, ask FO.

# Restorative:

- Collection is okay to be taken at the beginning of the appointment, this amount is noted on the appointment.
- If treatment changes mid appointment:
- Stop clinical work so that assistant can add the new treatment into Open Dental
- If a small procedure is added, continue with the treatment
- If a large procedure, or multiple procedures are added, have the treatment coordinator come back and let the patient know of the new patient portion.
- At the end of the appointment, bring the route slip up with the new treatment written at the top and ask a treatment coordinator if the new procedure code is correct and what the new patient portion is. (Treatment coordinator should write the new patient portion on the top of the route slip for the assistant to relay back to the patient in the op.)
- Walk the patient out and confirm again that the codes on the appointment are correct and get approval from the Doctor to set the appointment complete. (If a treatment coordinator is not available to confirm, mark the appointment as dismissed and leave the appointment as scheduled).
- If nothing changed, set the appointment complete as it was.
- FOR NOTES: Doctors will set appointments complete once procedures are correct. If you need to make a note in the chart, ask Dr. to set it complete to do so.

# Patient Agreement and Financial Policy

I hereby agree to be responsible for the costs of care provided by Blue Dental Care and/or the dental team for myself or my dependent(s). These include any deductibles and amounts not covered by insurance. I also understand that it is my responsibility to be aware of any limitations, and benefits of my insurance policy. Payment to this office is my responsibility and I am aware that if the insurance company does not reimburse the doctor, I am responsible for the total amount(s).

I understand that there will be a $50 charge to all accounts in which a check payment is returned.

I understand that because appointments are not double-booked, I must provide notice of cancellation at least 48 hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. For appointments scheduled for 90 minutes or longer, I will be required to make a reservation fee of $100 prior to scheduling the appointment, which will be applied to my out-of-pocket expense for the appointment. This reservation fee is
---
non-refundable. If I do not show up for my appointment or I do not give adequate notice if I am unable to keep my appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited. For appointments scheduled for less than 90 minutes in length, a $50 cancellation fee may apply if I do not provide notice of cancellation at least 48 hours prior to my scheduled appointment time.

We make every effort to schedule appointments that are most convenient for you and that fit your personal schedule. Because we do not schedule several patients at the same time, all appointments are reserved exclusively for you. In return, we ask that you make every effort not to change your reserved dental appointment.

I understand that for any treatment less than three hundred dollars ($300) payment in full is due at the time of service. I understand that after 60 days, any unpaid balance will incur a $10 billing fee. I understand that failure to pay amounts due to this office will result in my account being placed with a collection agency. In the event that my account is further referred to an attorney, I agree to pay all collection and attorney fees.

# 1. PAYMENT POLICY FOR NEW PATIENTS, EMERGENCY PATIENTS AND EXISTING PATIENTS:

- Payment is due at the time service is rendered for all services $250 and under. This includes any co-payments due from patients with dental insurance coverage.
- We accept cash, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit and debit cards. Although we do accept checks as a form of payment, we will use that as a last resort and only if the patient does not have another form of payment.
- Patients may leave a credit card on file for residual balances after insurance payment is received. We will contact the patient prior to charging the card as a courtesy.
- If the patient pays in full for services with cash at least 3 business days prior to the appointment in which their out-of-pocket expense is $1,000 or more we will extend a 5% courtesy discount. If they pay with credit or debit card, we will extend a 3% courtesy discount. This DOES NOT apply to patients who have a PPO insurance that we are in-network with. This courtesy may be extended to a patient who comes in for emergency treatment and could not have possibly pre-paid for treatment.
- If the patient pays in full for services with cash at least 3 business days prior to the appointment in which their out-of-pocket expense is between $300 and $999, we will extend a 5% courtesy discount. If they pay with credit or debit card a 3% courtesy discount will be extended. This DOES NOT apply to patients who have a PPO insurance that we are in-network with. This courtesy may be extended to a patient who comes in for emergency treatment and could not have possibly pre-paid for treatment.
- Patients requesting a payment plan will be directed to apply through Lending Club or Care Credit.
- An internal payment plan may be extended to a patient (after the practice has been open for 6 months). The patient must put down 25%, leave a credit card on file for 3 monthly payments of 25% each. The patient will incur a billing fee of $10 after 60 days if they choose this option.
- Internal payment plans may be extended to patients having orthodontic treatment. The patient must put a deposit down of $2,000 prior to beginning treatment and the remaining balance can be paid in six (6) monthly payments. The patient MUST keep a credit card on file for automatic monthly payments. This payment plan cannot exceed six (6) months.
- For multi-staged procedures, 50% payment is due at the first appointment and 50% will be due at the delivery appointment.

All treatment fees will be presented to the patient in writing and we will obtain a signature before scheduling treatment regardless of the dollar amount or insurance coverage. Copies of the financial arrangement will be scanned into the patient’s account and a copy will be given to the patient.

# 2. INSURED PATIENTS

- Prior to the patient’s appointment, we will check eligibility for all insured patients.
- We will estimate any co-payments and deductibles to the best of our ability.
- We will submit claims to primary and secondary insurance ONLY, unless required by contract for a third or fourth insurance.
- Insured patients will be required to pay any co-payments at the time services are rendered.
- Patients will be educated that regardless of insurance coverage, they are responsible for all charges incurred.
---
● As a rule, we will submit pre-treatment estimates for implants.

● We will submit the pre-treatment estimate to the insurance company and we will schedule the patient for 45 days out.

● Patients will be educated about the need or lack thereof pre-estimates.

# 3. APPOINTMENT RESERVATIONS, LATE CANCELLATIONS AND BROKEN APPOINTMENTS:

● For appointments that are 90 minutes in length or longer the patient will be required to put down a $100 reservation fee prior to scheduling the appointment.

● The reservation fee is non-refundable, if the patient does not provide adequate notice (2-business days) to cancel or reschedule their appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited. If the patient comes in for their appointment, the reservation fee will be applied towards the patient’s out-of-pocket co-payment.

● For appointments less than 90 minutes in length, if adequate notice (2-business days) is not given, a $50 cancellation fee may apply.

● The cancellation fee will be waived after the first offense (the fee will be applied to the account and adjusted off).

● At the doctor’s discretion, the cancellation fee may be waived upon the second offense. The patient may be asked to pay a reservation fee after the second offense to schedule another appointment. The reservation fee will be determined by Dr. Blue on a case-by-case basis.

● At the third consecutive offense, the fee will stand, and the patient may be dismissed from the practice.

● Dr. Blue MUST authorize the dismissal of a patient from the practice.

# 4. FINANCE CHARGES AND BILLING FEES:

● We will not be applying finance charges to accounts with outstanding balances.

● There will be a $10 billing fee applied to all accounts with balances outstanding 60 days or more.

# 5. RETURNED CHECKS:

● There will be a $50 charge applied to all accounts in which a check payment is returned.

● The check WILL NOT be re-deposited a second time.

● If the patient has a check returned, they will be required to pay by cash or credit card ONLY for future appointments.

# 6. SHOPPERS:

● To avoid confusion and us being held to a certain fee, we will not quote exact fees over the phone to patients, we will quote a WIDE fee range (ex: an x-ray could cost between $22 and $139).

# 7. PAST DUE ACCOUNTS:

● All accounts with an outstanding balance will be contacted will receive a statement at 30 days past due, a phone call at 45 days past due, a statement at 60 days past due, a phone call at 75 days.

● At 90 days past due the patient will incur a second billing fee and a FINAL Notice.

● If payment in full is not received by day 100, the account will be forwarded to a collection agency.

● Patients will be responsible for all fees incurred by a collection agency.

# 8. DIVORCE SITUATIONS:

286
---
● The parent/guardian who brings the child in for their appointment will be responsible for any necessary payment associated with that appointment. We will gladly give a receipt to the parent/guardian, so they may seek reimbursement from the other parent.

● A credit card may be kept on file for services rendered.

● In some rare instances, we may need to ask for a copy of the divorce decree explaining who is responsible for payment.

# 9. COURTESY ADJUSTMENTS:

● At the discretion of Dr. Blue, a courtesy adjustment of 15% may be given to other doctors and/or their staff members. This courtesy will only apply if they do not have dental insurance.

● At the discretion of Dr. Blue, family members, friends and clergy may be given a 20% courtesy adjustment. This courtesy will only apply if they do not have dental insurance.

# 10. DENTAL BENEFIT PLAN:

● For patients who DO NOT have dental insurance coverage.

● This is an in-house membership/savings plan for patients. This IS NOT an insurance plan!

● This plan can ONLY be used at Blue Dental Care.

● The Dental Benefit Plan CANNOT be combined with any other offers within the practice and CANNOT be used in conjunction with dental insurance.

IMPORTANT!!!! If a courtesy adjustment is offered to a patient, regardless of the reason, and the patient is insured, the courtesy must be extended to the insurance company as well.

For example, if the patient’s treatment is $1,000 and you extend a 5% or $50 pay in full courtesy, a note MUST be made in the narrative section of the claim form. If you do not follow this practice, you will be committing insurance fraud.

ATTN: Group Dental Claims Dept.

Dear Claims Examiner,

Please reprocess the attached claims for corrected payment based on IN NETWORK, Careington P-50 Fees. Your system has incorrectly processed the claims noting that the treating provider, Dr. Alex Donahue, is out of network, however he is IN NETWORK through the Careington Platinum network. Please be sure to update your system for all future claims to indicate that Dr. Donahue has been a participating provider through the Careington network since 10/1/2021. It is unclear why your system is no longer recognizing this participation correctly.

We hope that you find this documentation satisfactory to reprocess the patient's claim for payment. If you have any additional questions please let me know. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ingrid Monroe

# CIGNA INSURANCE - Billing Protocol for Buildup & Crown

If a patient has CIGNA insurance, we cannot bill out for a buildup and crown on the same day, as the buildup will be considered “inclusive of” the crown, and we will not get paid for that service.

# PROTOCOL:

1. Create Treatment Plan
1. Treatment Coordinator will add only the codes D2950 (Buildup) & D2740 (Crown) when creating treatment plans to present to patient
2. Collect for BOTH services on or before the PREP date appointment
3. Once Treatment plan has been presented to the patient
1. Add CignaCrownPREP & CignaCrownSEAT codes to patient’s chart
4. Schedule the PREP Appointment by Including 3 Codes:
1. D2950 (Buildup), D2740 (Crown) & CignaCrownPREP
1. This will block off enough time for the appointment, and indicate to the provider which services to complete as normal
5. At time of PREP Appointment
1. REMOVE/DESELECT the Crown (D2740) from the appointment BEFORE setting services complete
1. This will prevent our office from billing for the crown on the prep date. The CignaCrownPREP code will still remain attached to the appointment so that we know a crown was done
2. The Crown (D2740) code should now be moved to the SEAT appointment
6. Submit Claim for Prep Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2950 ON THE CLAIM
1. D2740 should not be attached to this DOS once appointment is completed
2. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code
7. If Collecting the patient portion at time of service on Prep Date
1. DO collect for both Buildup & Crown!
8. Schedule the patient’s Crown SEAT Appointment in 3-4 weeks
1. Include 2 Codes: D2740 (Crown) & CignaCrownSEAT
1. This will indicate that the crown has already been done and we are simply cementing the permanent crown, but we need to BILL for the Crown at this appointment
9. At time of SEAT Appointment
1. KEEP both codes (D2740 & CignaCrownSEAT) selected and Set complete
2. BILL for the crown D2740
10. Submit Claim for SEAT Appointment
1. ONLY INCLUDE D2740 ON THE CLAIM
1. CignaCrownPREP is a dummy/no bill ins code
---
# Codes & Terms to Know:

- “Prep Date”
- This is the date that the Buildup and Crown are both “done”, and we would normally bill for both services on the prep date, except when the patient has Cigna insurance! If patient has Cigna, ONLY BILL for the Buildup
- “Seat Date”
- The appointment 3-4 weeks later when the permanent crown is cemented. This is the date to submit the crown if the patient has Cigna insurance!
- D2950 - Core Buildup
- Should always be billed on the “Prep” date
- D2740 - Crown (Porcelain/Ceramic)
- Pt has Cigna INS - Bill on “Seat” date
- Pt has other INS (that pays for crown & bu same day) - Bill on “Prep” date
- CignaCrownPREP - Dummy code to indicate crown service was done but not billed yet
- Attach to “Prep” Date appointment
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance
- CignaCrownSEAT - Dummy code to indicate the correct date to bill for the Crown
- Attach to “Seat” Date appointment in addition to Crown (D2740)
- Do not bill dummy code to insurance

# Humana FEDVIP

● DO NOT EVEN BOOK THESE PATIENTS UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO PAY 100% CASH FEES

# Principal Insurance Plans - do they pay off UCR or lower fees?

# LOWER FEES EXAMPLE

● DO NOT SCHEDULE PATIENTS WITH A PLAN LIKE THIS!

○ Plan pays off a “set fee schedule” that is very low. Patient will end up with a large out of pocket amount for all services including exams/cleanings/x-rays
---
# OFFICE FEES EXAMPLE

Plan pays generally based on our office fees. Patients most likely will not have an out of pocket for exams/cleanings/x-rays. The patient should be made aware that their plan may or may not pay the full amounts we expect for other treatment, and an additional out of pocket may be owed after we receive the insurance EOB/payment on a claim.

# Example letter of for going out of network with delta PPO & becoming a Delta Premier only office

Dear Valued Patient,

At ABC Dentistry, we are grateful for all of our incredible patients and thrilled you are a part of our dental family.

We are contacting you because in the coming weeks you will likely be receiving a letter from Delta Dental informing you that I, Dr. Appelsies will now be a Delta Premier Provider. We understand letters like this from insurance can be confusing and misleading.

# What does this mean for you?

- Good news, you can still be seen at our office and you continue to have coverage with Delta Dental with our providers
- If your plan is Delta Premier Only or offers both Delta PPO and Premier benefits this might mean a slight difference in your coinsurance. As every plan is different we recommend reviewing your specific contract to determine your coinsurance rates.
- Our goal is to provide you with the highest quality dental care possible, one of the ways we do so is by choosing the best materials. Delta Premier status will allow us to continue to deliver you the best treatment available.

Additionally, if you have questions, we are happy to help check your current plan for you.

We appreciate you and your families and again are happy to answer any questions you may have!

Sincerely,
Dr. Ryan Blue

# Sample Letter: Going out of network with insurance company

Dear [Valued Patient],

At Blue Dental Care, we are grateful for all of our incredible patients and thrilled you are a part of our dental family.

We are contacting you because our practice’s relationship with your dental insurance has changed. You likely received an explanation of benefits from [insurance company] after your most recent visit, letting you know that we are no longer contracted with your plan.

# What does this mean for you?

- Good news, you can still be seen at our office, since your plan includes coverage for an out-of-network, or nonparticipating, provider.
- This might mean a slight difference in your coinsurance percentages, deductible, and/or annual maximum amount. As every plan is different, we recommend reviewing your specific contract to determine your coverage. Please also keep in mind that even if your plan indicates “100%” coverage for diagnostic and preventive services, they may not truly pay our full office fees. In the future, you may owe an out-of-pocket amount for these services.
- As a courtesy to you, the patient portion for your exam, x-rays, and/or cleaning at your most recent visit has been waived! In the future, if insurance does not pay the full amount that we had expected, our office will send you a bill for the remaining difference.
- Our goal is to provide you with the highest quality dental care possible (one of the ways we do so is by choosing the best materials). We are a patient-driven practice and are unwilling to compromise our standards by allowing insurance companies to call the shots.
- Despite our change in network participation, we have team members who are highly skilled and knowledgeable when it comes to dental insurance, and will continue to submit claims on your behalf to maximize your benefits.
- You may also choose to consider changing dental carriers when open enrollment comes around for 2024. Alternatively, we offer a wonderful in-house dental savings plan!

Additionally, if you have questions, we are happy to help check your current plan for you.

We appreciate you and your families and again are happy to answer any questions you may have!

Sincerely,
Dr. Ryan Blue

# Dental Savings Plan Production Allocation

This is very much specific to our office. We no longer offer hygiene bonuses but we do pay dentists on production while applying the entire Dental Savings Plan membership fee to the practice, therefore, we do have to manually allocate some production to each dentist for their exam. Since this is not UCR fees we allocate a much lower dollar amount for the exam production on a Dental Savings Plan because those exams are a great opportunity to discover dental treatment.

- Dental Savings Plan production allocation will be based on the discounted rate for a family of 4. DSP patients are cash patients that allow us to get reimbursed at a much higher rate than insurance patients, so take good care of them and make them long term loyal patrons of our practice.
- Most procedures and adjustments for DSP members are a straight 15% discount and very straight forward for calculating your production accurately, this document is intended for allocating production for services provided that are included in the $365/yr membership fee.
- Exams, Regular Cleanings (including up to 2 perio maintenance), X-rays and Fluoride are included in the plan and therefore not a straight 15% adjustment.
- There is no easy way to split this up, we believe this is more than fair, the difference in production and DSP fee goes toward management of the plan and marketing expenses to acquire more NP to the practice.

# Dentist Production

- No production for Limited Exams, Emergency Exams, Additional X-rays needed at emergency appointments (or other complimentary / included DSP services as per the DSP brochure).
- $500 OFF invisalign.
- $4,000 Implant start to finish.
- When a patient comes in For Initial Comp Exam or Periodic Exams (2 per year per patient) you will ADD $35 towards your production for that day and have signed off by Office Manager.

# Hygienist Production

- For each recall you ADD $100 to your end of day production report and have signed by Office Manager, whether or not you took X-rays that day. This is based on the law of averages, sometimes you will take an FMX, sometimes no x-rays, sometimes just bite wings...we will base your production at $100 for every DSP member recall.
- Remember DSP covers 2 cleanings per year so the production above is for the 2 times per year that the patient has an exam with a dentist.
- For example if you have a perio maintenance patient that comes 4 times per year, 2 of their cleanings are covered with DSP and the other 2 they will pay 15% off of our UCR fee for Perio Maintenance which will go towards your production normally.

# $200 NP special

- Allocate $52 to Doctor Production and $144 to Hygiene production.

# Dropping Insurance

# Key Considerations for Dropping an Insurance Plan

If, after much deliberation and evaluation of the statistics, you decide that dropping an insurance contract is the right thing for your practice, then we want to leave you with a few pieces of advice.

Deciding to go out-of-network (OON) with an insurance provider can be a complex decision for a dental practice. When you’re OON, insurance companies typically don’t offer a clear picture of reimbursements, making it difficult to provide patients with an accurate estimate of their financial responsibilities. In many cases, benefits may be assigned directly to patients rather than the practice, which impacts cash flow and necessitates clear communication with patients.

For practices with several PPO contracts, a gradual or stepwise approach is usually the correct course of action when moving toward a Fee-For-Service (FFS) model. This shift requires not only a high level of skill in patient communication (verbiage) but also a standout patient experience that differentiates your practice from competitors. Additionally, promoting an in-office savers or dental savings plan can provide patients with an appealing alternative.

Before making the change, it’s essential to believe in and communicate the value your team brings. In some cases, insurance plans might already reimburse close to 100% of your usual and customary rate (UCR) for preventive services, which can boost hygiene production. Evaluating your patient base and identifying which insurance plans to drop first based on this data is also key, especially given the current high cost of hygiene wages and the need for production goals that align with those costs.

For a deeper dive on analyzing your insurance participation strategy, scan this QR code for a free webinar.

# Analyzing Financial Data

To make informed decisions, consider pulling your 20 most common codes, and create a spreadsheet comparing UCR fees against the reimbursements from each insurance plan. You’ll also want a breakdown of total active patients per insurance provider and a look at new patient trends over the last 18 months.

If a local competitor recently dropped a plan you still accept, you might notice an increase in new patients on that plan, which could impact your decision. To see a more detailed process around this, check out the DSN Manual: The Dental Supply Ordering and Fee Analysis Manual.

# Scenario Planning and Community Awareness

Run scenarios to assess potential patient loss by dropping each insurance plan. For instance, if a plan makes up a significant portion of your patient base, assess if you could afford to lose 30% of those patients. Reviewing the revenue generated from each insurance provider, the time spent processing
---
claims, and the rejection rates can further guide your choices. Understanding the community’s insurance-consciousness—often higher in blue-collar areas and among young families—can also indicate how changes may impact patient loyalty.

# Clearly define your goals.

A fully FFS model can be challenging for associate-driven practices since FFS relationships often hinge on the rapport between patients and the founding doctor. A mixed model, where some doctors are in-network while others are OON, could also complicate billing. Additionally, consider that FFS practices typically require fewer staff, as the administrative burden of insurance verification is less intense.

# Marketing, Communication, and Timeline

The next big thing we suggest is to have a good set of communication strategies to help team members speak to patients eloquently around the change of status with regard to this insurance. Scripting and role-playing around each difficult question is extremely important. Inevitably there will be questions around, “Do you take my insurance? Can I still see you? Will I pay more?”. Some of these questions have many underlying false beliefs and assumptions, and so the more you can learn and coach the team on best communication strategies, the better your office will be.

For the best possible transition, consider a 12 to 24-month planning period before notifying insurance providers or patients. This slow timeline allows for two recall visits, during which you can have knee-to-knee conversations with patients, explaining the reasons and benefits behind the change. Preparing a one-sheet FAQ can also help address common questions. It’s important to anticipate that, once notified, the insurance carrier will likely send a letter to patients discouraging them from staying with your practice due to potential out-of-network fees.

# How to get more benefits while not being completely out of network

Consider adding fees for specific upgrades, such as Invisalign, premium denture options, or bone graft materials, to help offset lower reimbursements from certain networks. By setting up dummy codes for these items, you can transparently communicate the additional costs to patients without impacting their perception of standard fees.

# Decision-Making Checklist

# Preparations:

- Evaluate the clarity of reimbursement data for OON plans.
- Identify which insurance plans assign benefits directly to patients.
- Determine if a stepwise approach aligns with your FFS goals.
- Assess the team's communication skills and patient experience quality.
- Promote the in-office dental savings plan as an alternative for patients.
---
# Financial Analysis:

- Pull top 20 codes and compare UCR to each insurance fee schedule.
- Assess patient base per insurance plan and new patient trends over 18 months.
- Calculate revenue generated and time spent on claims per insurance carrier.
- Track claims rejection rates, especially for high-cost treatments like crowns and SRP.

# Scenario and Community Considerations:

- Run scenarios on patient loss rates and financial impact for each plan.
- Assess patient characteristics for plans you’re considering dropping.
- - If you are looking for a list of patients on a specific carrier/plan, use Query #184 from OpenDental to gather this list of patients seen over a specific period of time. (https://opendentalsoft.com:1943/ODQueryList/QueryList.aspx)

Evaluate community insurance-consciousness and average household income.

# Goal Setting and Planning:

- Define whether a fully FFS model aligns with your practice’s goals.
- Determine if you can sustain a mixed model with some doctors OON.
- Plan for team size adjustments post-transition to FFS.

# Patient Communication:

- Set a 12-month preparation timeline.
- Conduct two recall visits to explain the change to patients.
- Create a one-sheet FAQ for common questions.
- Prepare for potential negative communication from the insurance carrier post-notification.

# Enhancements:

- Add dummy codes for upgrades not covered by insurance (e.g., Invisalign, premium denture options, bone grafting materials) to increase transparency on costs.

This structured approach, combined with checklists, helps ensure a strategic transition that minimizes patient loss and keeps the practice financially sustainable while enhancing patient satisfaction.

Now if you have read this entire chapter and think that everyone needs to go out-of-network, we do not propose that at all. The best thing for all dentists is to know their data, and make the best decision for themselves. Sometimes that is to be in-network with many insurances. Sometimes it’s the exact opposite. And Sometimes it’s a mix of in-network and out-of-network. Just like with bonding agents, PVS, and composites, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to insurance either.
