# Treatment Coordinator Notes

# How to Avoid Over-explaining

1. LESS IS MORE
- When you over explain it’s because you have a fear that they won’t believe you, so you give more detail in hopes that they will believe you know what you’re talking about.
- The more words you use to tell the truth, the less believable it sounds.
- When you give more detail, you aren’t preventing misunderstanding, you’re ensuring it.
2. DON’T ASSUME THEIR QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT
- If they want to know, they will ask. If they have a question, they will ask.
- Instead of being a waterfall of information, be a well.
3. Next time you find yourself using the word “Because”, ask yourself: DID THEY ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION, OR DO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY NEED IT?
- If it’s because you feel like it, you can probably do better without it.

# Verbiage

It’s about WHAT we say & HOW we say it

Don’t ask questions…

- NOT “would you like to get those fillings scheduled?” Instead “LET’S GO AHEAD and get you on Dr. Blue’s schedule, how does next Tuesday at 3pm look?”
- Not “Do you want to take care of that…” Instead “Let’s go ahead and take care of that now…”
- Avoid: Yes or No Questions - it is harder to come back and take control of the conversation when you do not get the answer you want or expect
- “Do you have any questions?” vs “What questions do you have for me?”
- NEVER EVER EVER talk about PPO vs. Premier on a NP call - they have no clue what you’re talking about - if you find out they’re PPO only later - you call them back & have this convo

Other Verbiage to Avoid
---
CAN’T & UNFORTUNATELY instead say FORTUNATELY, I have great news

Avoid talking about fee schedules - people don’t know what you’re talking about

Avoid getting wrapped up in insurance conversations, let’s not forget the value we bring to the patient

Never say the schedule is wide open- specify a couple times (start by offering the same time and day the next week)

# Treatment Presentation Fundamentals

- Avoid Word Vomit - power in some silence
- Speak Confidently and Clearly
- Creating Urgency
- Goal is same day Tx (if time allows- they are already here, saves a trip, saves practice money, etc.)
- Avoid Overwhelming the patient (prioritizing- can present 1st priority only if they seem very overwhelmed)
- Whenever someone offers you $ take it
- Pre collect if we can - do not give option

# Collecting

“It will be nine-ninety-eight today…” (do not say dollars)

If we take care of a patient don’t be afraid to take credit for it

Ex: “As a courtesy to you Dr. Blue went ahead and took care of that 3D X-ray”

# Presenting Treatment

# Smaller Treatment Plan (which will be completed in 1 visit)

Present all the treatment, MUST still re-iterate Urgency

Goal: Same Day or Get patient scheduled within 1-2 weeks with Doctor

1. Here’s the recommended treatment (summarize what doc said w/ urgency)
2. Your insurance is going to take care of a good portion of this, again anytime we’re dealing with insurance this is our best estimate
3. Your portion for everything is six-hundred-ninety
4. We can go ahead and take care of that today let’s get you on the schedule - how’s next Tuesday at 1 pm

# Power in Silence

# Very Large Treatment Plan

Once treatment has been prioritized…

Avoid overwhelming the patient “Foot in the door”

“Dr. Alex’s biggest concern is this first priority, we definitely want to get that taken care of right away, we find it best to focus on getting this done & then follow up with next steps…”

# Power in Silence
---
Helping block things together - explaining you only have to get numb once if we get half SRP and fillings together.

Use oral sedation/ nitrous to help patients with dental anxiety - it is a great service.

If they do say no - ask pt if we can follow up with them in a few weeks (add to audit list).

# Getting over Fears of talking about $$$

Remember - you did not create this problem - you are offering a solution.

This problem will never get cheaper for the patient than it is today - you advocating for them to get it done now is your greatest ability to save them $.

The problem is not going away by you avoiding the $ convo.

Avoid making assumptions about the patient’s financial situation and their feelings about $, what they consider “expensive” etc.

Don’t offer/bring up payment plans unless the patient asks.

Don’t project your own personal view on $ & finances on the patient (It’s a free country and their choice how they want to spend their $).

# Breaking up Payments - Collecting

1. GOAL - Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan.
3. In office payment plan - 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments - need proper paperwork.
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing.
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford.

# Example verbiage when patient accepts treatment, declines NG

“Apparently these guys don’t believe in preventing future damage and costs so they’re not going to pay for your NG but FORTUNATELY you do get a discount and as Dr. X discussed this is really going to help protect your teeth long term.”

“So let’s go ahead and get you scanned for the NG ….”

Or

“Let’s go ahead & get you scheduled for X tx and that NG.”

# Phone Tips

- Take a deep breath & SMILE.
- Avoid rabbit holes, take control of the conversation.
- Don’t get caught answering all of the questions, you need to lead the conversation.
- TONE: match their tone - volume & speed.
- AVOID - word vomit / too much info.
- Communication is 55% non-verbal so on the phone all we have is 38% our tone and 7% the words we use.
---
# Group Phone Training Idea

Pick mostly good ones and a few bad ones and sit around and critique each other - make it fun!

# Common “difficult” phone call themes

# Patient Asks right away “Do you take my insurance”

YOUR RESPONSE: “I can absolutely help you with that, who can we thank for referring you to our office?”

# Patient calls to cancel &lt;48 hours notice

YOUR RESPONSE: “Ohhh, can I ask what’s going on?”

“Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# How much does a crown cost

YOUR RESPONSE: “I can absolutely help you with that…”

Goal: Create Value & Get them in for a consult with the doctor

Do not give exact $ amounts for cost of tx we have not diagnosed

# Picking Up Same Day Treatment

Offering same day treatment is a great service to the patient. They are in the chair, the room is ready to go, and it saves the patient an extra trip in their busy lives. If the team communicates properly and the schedule allows for it, there should be no reason we can't offer this to our patients.

# Picking up in hygiene or restorative:

- Doctor verbiage to patient: “We are going to go ahead and work this up on paper, and the gals will double check if we can take care of this today to save you a trip”
- IF NOT RUNNING TO NEXT ROOM Doctor announces possible pick up to assistants and the tx (white) board. (room # , Pick UP, possible Tx)
- Whoever works up the tx financially (TC, or hygienist) is responsible to communicate with restorative assistants that we are wanting to pick up “X”, and ask them which Op / Assistant can do this
- At this time, if the Assistants see any barriers to picking up this same day TX, they will explain
- TC can help with consent and blood pressure if they have time

# Supernumerary Teeth: How To Open Dental:

- To chart a procedure with adult teeth: go to “procedures” list and pull up what type of Ext is needed.
- Where the tooth number is asked you will add 50 to whatever tooth number the supernumerary tooth is above. (EX: a supernumerary tooth above #16: 16+50=66)
- Primary teeth- A-T. Always put the tooth letter of the tooth that is under supernumerary and add an “S” after.

4. Divide forms by provider (hygiene or restorative); then sort by time.
5. On each form, highlight:
1. Name, Time, Provider & Important Notes
1. If a New Patient; write NP on top left corner and check to see if paperwork has been completed, Insurance is on file, and that referral has been added to account. If not, write near the top of the sheet: a box to check and PPW.
2. Check if next appt is scheduled
1. if it is, fill out the NDTR, with date (including day of week) & time.
2. If it is not, then note what next appointment should be.
6. Any Exam that is being done, put an exam sheet behind Routing Slip.
7. Any Pt that is going to Hyg & Rest, staple routing slips together and is put in a pile that coordinates with the first appt.

- Stop clinical work so that assistant can add the new treatment into Open Dental
- If a small procedure is added, continue with the treatment
- If a large procedure, or multiple procedures are added, have the treatment coordinator come back and let the patient know of the new patient portion.
- At the end of the appointment, bring the route slip up with the new treatment written at the top and ask a treatment coordinator if the new procedure code is correct and what the new patient portion is. (Treatment coordinator should write the new patient portion on the top of the route slip for the assistant to relay back to the patient in the op.)
- Walk the patient out and confirm again that the codes on the appointment are correct and get approval from the Doctor to set the appointment complete. (If a treatment coordinator is not available to confirm, mark the appointment as dismissed and leave the appointment as scheduled).
- If nothing changed, set the appointment complete as it was.
- FOR NOTES: Doctors will set appointments complete once procedures are correct. If you need to make a note in the chart, ask Dr. to set it complete to do so.

# PATIENT CHECKOUT

Effective:

Desired Outcome: Each patient is dismissed kindly and promptly. Each account is reviewed for past due balances. All payments are requested courteously. All payments are processed accurately.

Measurement: Feedback from patients and practice manager. Review of patient accounts and daily close reports.

# Guidelines

1. Do’s and don’ts.
1. Always smile!
2. Always be professional and discreet! (Assist—not insist.)
3. Never ask a question you don't want to hear the answer to!
4. Never say, "Can you take care of that today, Mrs. Jones?" (Answer: "No, bill me.")
5. Never say, “How much would you like to pay today, Mrs. Jones?" (Answer: "$10 a month for the next 10 years.")
6. Simply state the fee and let them indicate if they can't follow their arrangements.
2. Educate patients tactfully regarding their dental insurance:
1. Their dental benefits are based on what the carrier offers and the plan they selected.
2. You bill the insurance as a courtesy to all your patients and will help them maximize their benefits; nonetheless they’re ultimately responsible for payment.
---
# Asking For Payment

1. Once a patient is ready to check out:
1. Verify the patient’s insurance information.
1. If the patient has a new insurance, get a copy of their insurance card including the following information:
1. Name and address of the insurance carrier
2. Employer or policy group #
3. Policyholder’s birthdate
4. Name of the policyholder’s employer
5. Policyholder’s social security
2. Review the current day’s charges and collect the appropriate payments.
1. Extend discounts to patients when applicable according to your Internal Financial Guidelines.
3. Kindly inform the patient of the total fee. For instance:

"Mrs. Jones, your fee (or payment) for today is $250. Will you be using cash, check, or credit card?"

1. If the patient makes a partial payment or no payment:
1. Give them a walk out statement and ask that they call with a credit card or mail in a payment.
2. Ask them to call you, if the payment will be later than one week.
3. Thank them for their cooperation.
2. If the patient has a past due account balance, attempt to make financial arrangements.
4. Post the payment to the patient’s account:
1. Endorse the payment with the bank stamp, if made by check.
2. Place the payment in the daily receipt envelope.
3. Write a receipt for payment including the following patient information, if payment is with cash:
1. name
2. total charge for the current visit
3. payment amount
4. date of payment
5. change made
---
# Return and Specialist Appointments

1. Make the appropriate return appointment, as indicated on the route slip or in the patient’s treatment plan.
2. If the patient needs an appointment with a specialist, refer to Appointment Scheduling: Specialty Referrals for further instruction.

# How To Walk Out An Appointment (Front End)

1. Double check that the services in the appointment were rendered as planned (i.e. Fluoride)
1. If they were not, then remove any services that were not completed
1. Double click on the appointment and deselect the service
2. If an additional service was rendered
1. Double click the appointment and add the service
2. Right Click Appointment
1. “Set Complete”
3. Click “View Patient Appointments”
1. Making sure patient has a recall appointment scheduled: hyg, post op, crown seat, etc
4. View Account
1. Submit the insurance claim
1. With Cigna and United HealthCare - remember that you have to submit the build up and crown separate. We will still collect payment from patient for the build-up and crown, but only submit the build-up at 1st appointment, and submit the crown at the seat date
5. Collect out of pocket from patient
1. If there is a previous balance, collect this amount too
1. If EVER in doubt and someone is not able to assist you with the account, collect based off what is written on the routing slip to collect and tell pt we will be in touch if there are any issues

# How to work-up a treatment plan:

1. Examine the procedures that need to be done on the pt’s Exam sheet
2. Go to the patient's profile and click on “chart” on the left side. Then click on a specific tooth number and then select procedure under quick buttons or procedure buttons that match treatment.
---
1. Example: if Patient has a DO on #30, click on tooth #30 on the chart, and select the quick button DO, under “post. Composites”
2. After inputting all procedures that need to be done in pt’s chart, click on the Treatment plan on the left side.
3. Prioritize the procedures in which the Dr. went over during the exam. (Tx priorities can be found on the exam sheet on the bottom of the page.)
4. Select all procedures for the 1st priority, and then click on number 1 on the right side of the page under “set priority box”.
NOTE: Make sure you deselect previous procedures so they don’t carry on to priority 2 when selecting the next ones.
Prioritize all procedures under 1,2,3,4, etc so pt. is aware of what is top priority.
Once the plan is all organized and tx’s are prioritized, click on “print tp”.

# How to present a treatment plan:

1. Kindly walk in and greet the patient, introduce yourself and shake hands, and take a seat next to them. Ask the patient questions about themself, tell them a little bit about you, etc.
2. Present tx plan right in front of them and go over the tooth numbers and the procedure to each tooth. Example: “Ok Debbie, so it looks like on your upper right on tooth #30 Dr. Green stated that we need to do a root canal, build up the crown as your first priority. As well as a filling on your upper right tooth number 3, and number 5. We can go ahead and schedule all of those together because you will be numb on the right side.”
3. Go through all the entire tx plan thoroughly, stopping anytime the patient has questions regarding tx.
4. At the end, ask again “What questions do you have for me?”
5. Once you and the patient have talked about the tx plan, have them sign and date the bottom. Assuring them that the pt’s signature is just acknowledging all the details we just went over with them.
6. Walk patients up to the front, and have them sit in white chair.
7. Re-iterate what the tx plan priorities are and have the patient schedule them! Or at least the first priority.
PLEASE TRY AND PRE-COLLECT PAYMENT FOR THE PROCEDURE(s).
8. Ask patients if they would like a copy for their records. If YES- scan signed copy to their profile under Treatment Plans. Staple original copy, and then give the original copy to the patient.

# New Patient Scheduling Addendum

If a new patient calls to schedule a cleaning, we ask when their last cleaning was. If it has been more than 3 years, there is a higher chance that they will need an SRP rather than a prophy. If that is the case, we can find a 60 minute slot on the restorative side and schedule them for an FMX and Comprehensive Exam 60 minutes before Clo or Michelle’s scheduled break of 30.
---
minutes (or random 30 min empty slot on hygiene side). If the patient does not end up needing an SRP, then Clo or Michelle will do a prophy during their 30 minute scheduled break (or any hygienist in a 30 min empty slot). This may require help from available assistants to possibly pull back the hygienist’s next patient (maybe do x rays or exam so we can all stay on schedule and make the most of our time.)

# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

# New Patient without insurance

- Take FMX per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

# Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

- Send on Claim: FMX only D0210
- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X Rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 8 Posterior PAs)
---
A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional x-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional x-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment, etc.

If we take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL

If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X Rays

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim! (Here’s an EXAMPLE for why)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA x-rays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA x-rays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X RAYS

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 4 BW-X Rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)

Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 4 BW-X Rays D0272 & Pano D0330

Send of Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X Rays. (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance

Send on Claim: 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY

- If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.
- If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW & 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!
- If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)
---
- Take 4 BW-X Rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #24).
- NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.
- Pay careful attention to any note from ins coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to the patient portion.
- This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but may waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
- If deductible applies to all x-rays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect the deductible amount from the patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW x-rays if they are not covered @ 100%.
- If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional x-rays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion.
- We take a new FMX every 3-5 years unless needed for a specific reason before then.

# Adult Recare - DUE FOR X-RAYS but NOT Eligible for BW (plan allows only 1x/24 months)

Send on Claim: 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), THREE Addt’l PAs as D0230 (+tooth #)

- In the instance that a plan only allows bitewings once in a 24 month period, some plans (such as Delta Dental) will allow you to take and bill out up to 4 PA x-rays in a visit.
- Hygienists may still choose to take bitewings and 2 PAs as usual, but on the claim, we will bill out 4 PAs
- REMEMBER THAT WITH PAs, The first PA you take will use the code D0220, and ALL ADDITIONAL PAs will use the code D0230.

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)

- If the patient is due for x-rays and is eligible for a FMX and we have not taken one in 3+ years, delete the BW & PA codes and change to a FMX (D0210).
- Can be due to patients changing insurance, not being eligible for FMX at their very first visit, etc.
- In the past, we used to bill out a FMX and just write it off if not covered by insurance. This may be the case for some patients (usually if their first visit was before the year 2022).

# PANORAMIC X-RAYS - no bill insurance most of the time

- Many times we take a Pano on patients for diagnostic/treatment related reasons (i.e. Wisdom teeth, implants or bridges, ortho, etc).
- ONLY EVER BILL OUT A PANO TO INS IF IT IS PART OF A FMX COMBO (PANO + 4BW).
- Pano and FMX share a frequency on insurance plans, but the fee for a FMX is about $30 higher than that for a Pano, so when we only bill out a Pano, we are missing out on potential production. Also, if you add the Pano to a visit where we are taking other.

# How to use the “ASAP” Function in Open Dental

108
---
# ASAP List Management

If a patient notes that they would like to come in for their appointment on a different day if something opens up, you can add them to the ASAP List! Here’s how:

- Double click to open the patient’s appointment in Open Dental
- Check the “ASAP” box in the upper left
- Make notes in the appointment details specifying any patient preferences & requirements for rescheduling (day of the week, time of day, next available, etc). Make sure these notes go at the TOP of the details so that they’ll be visible when checking the ASAP list.

# To view the ASAP List in Open Dental:

- Click the “Appointment Lists” icon (looks like a sheet of paper) located above the calendar on the right hand panel
- Select ASAP
- You will see all patients who currently have “ASAP” noted on their account

# Texts Hygiene Reactivation & Unscheduled Treatment

# Personalized Message

“Hello Mrs. Jones, this is Katrina from Green Dental Care. I hope you’re having a great day. Dr. Brianna wanted me to reach out because we are quickly approaching the end of 2023 & we have a few immediate openings left, but her schedule is filling up quickly. You do have remaining dental insurance benefits that you’ve already paid for that you may want to take advantage of before the year ends and they go away. To schedule simply call 555-5555 and ask for me or schedule online at your convenience at this link. All the best, Katrina”

# Someone on ASAP List

If any of these appointments work for you please simply text me back or call at 555-5555. You can also schedule online at this link. link

All the best, Katrina

Due to high demand for dental hygiene appointments please know if you currently have an appointment and do not confirm with us with 48 hours (via our many confirmation methods) your appointment time will be made available to other patients that are seeking an appointment.

# Filling Hygiene Schedule

While doing One Week Calls:

- When patients call and cancel, the dummy code is put in the appointment and the reason is put in the appointment notes. We are going to start putting more notes at the top of the appointment notes in capital letters with the following information: “PROVIDER AND SERVICES THAT WERE ATTACHED TO APPOINTMENT”
- When hygienists go do their one week calls they will look one week back and see if their name as the provider is in any of the appointment notes
- If they see their name on the top of the appointment notes they will check that person's account to see if they have already rescheduled or not
- If they have rescheduled no need to call
- If they have NOT rescheduled they will make a call or text that patient to get them rescheduled

# Weekly Hygienist Filing Schedule Protocol:

1. Each week the front office will print the Divergent Dental Recall List
2. The list will be located by the third computer in the front in the folder labeled ‘HYG AUDIT LIST’.
3. When hygienists have downtime they can start working through the list.
4. Audit! Please call or text the patient and then make appropriate commlog notes/documentation.
5. Please read the notes first!! Do NOT call if it is a contrast patient or notes about patient moving, etc.
6. IF that happens please inactivate and put the reason for inactivation in the chart. OR go to ‘Family’, double click in the recall section, double click on the cleaning and mark the box ‘Always Disabled’. This will take them off of the future lists if we do not want to call them but also do not want to inactivate the patient.
7. After reading the notes and making sure they are a good patient to audit, cross off the name on the list once you call or text them and put your initials next to the patient's name.
8. We will work fully through this list every week. A new one will be added weekly.
9. If this list is completed already please see below to look for more opportunities!

Goal: 5 per hygienist per day

# FO Weekly Filling Schedule Protocols:

# OPTION 1: Check ASAP List / Unscheduled List

# OPTION 2: Check Restorative Schedule

- See if any patients on the doctors schedule around your open appointment time also need a cleaning. If so, call the patient and let them know we can get them in at that time and knock out two birds with one stone.
- Also, if any family members are in need of cleanings then call to see if they can come at the same time as their family.
---
# OPTION 3: Check Recall List

- At the front desk in the silver file holder next to front desk phone there will be a 1-2 page weekly recall list
- Google Docs has text verbiage already made or you can add your own and copy and paste into flex to text patients

# OPTION 4: Look ahead 1-2 weeks

- If there is a gap in the schedule look ahead a week or two and see if patients at that time would like to move their appointment up a week but keep the same time. Check if pt is eligible to be seen early before calling. Let pt know that “we had availability to see them a week/two weeks early and wanted to offer that appointment to them.” Avoid using phrases as “cancellation” or “filling schedule.”

FO will also help with the Hygienist’s Divergent List!

An automated text goes out daily to patients that are overdue for recalls if we have openings.

Hygienist will schedule PMV patients out for two 3MRC at a time to ensure time available.

# CONFIRMATION POLICY

WE WILL NEED A CONFIRMED APPOINTMENT WITHIN 48 HOURS OF APPOINTMENT OR APPOINTMENT IS AT RISK OF BEING REMOVED FROM SCHEDULE. WILL EXPLAIN THIS TO PATIENTS ON 1 WEEK REMINDER CALLS AND TEXTS. IF PATIENTS DO NOT CONFIRM MOVE TO DUMMY COLUMN AND OPEN UP APPOINTMENT.

MUST MAKE COMLOG NOTES EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU AUDIT A PATIENT!!!

# Overdue Recall Protocol

1. Print List: Active Patients with no scheduled appointments
2. First check notes / popups to see why patient may have not returned
3. Call Patient:

# Hygiene Audit Voicemail

“Hi ______________. This is ____________ calling from ABC Dental. We noticed we haven’t seen you in a little bit & wanted to check in to see if we could get you back on track with your dental cleanings. Please call us back as soon as possible at 555-555-5555. Thanks so much! Have a wonderful day!”

Oh hey how are you?! We were just calling because you are overdue for your cleaning OR you had to reschedule your last cleaning and we just wanted to keep you on track with your regular preventative visits. I can get you in either x or y date (offer 2 appointment dates and times)?”

1. SCHEDULE.
2. If they say no: “When would be a good time to call you back to make sure we are able to get you scheduled with your preferred time?” add them to the AUDIT NOTE LIST the week they want follow up or say “you can also schedule online at your convenience on dentistparker.com”

1. What day & time of the week work best for you?
2. Great let’s get you in on the doctor side next week
1. Make note in appointment (overdue recall patient needs cleaning if something opens up)
2. More than likely something will open up & we will be able to get you in sooner for a cleaning

- Reason for not scheduling Time, Money, Anxiety, one time patient
- IF they are not motivated and likely won’t do treatment-turn off all unscheduled treatment automatic text reminders
- They recently had a lot of work done and are motivated to continue other treatment but wanted to wait a few weeks due to finances - Require Follow up

# AUDIT CALL VERBIAGE

“Checking schedule” “talking to spouse” “checking finances”

# GENERAL FOLLOW UP:

He has some openings that I’ve been eyeing for you, give me a call and we can find something that works with your schedule. You can text me back at this number or call 555-555-5555”

# MONEY CONCERNS

# Pro Tips:

- Minimize # of audits by ensuring every patient leaves with an appointment
- Minimize # of audits by making sure anyone who changes an appointment gets rescheduled
- Best time to call is Wednesdays & Thursdays (Lunch or late afternoon early evening)
- Any patients with voicemail not set up call second time then TEXT
- Not following the system leads to WAYYY more work later, don’t fall for this trap, stay on Top of these.
- Be sure to check patient’s chart before calling to make sure they aren’t scheduled already before calling or texting

# Why are audits important?

This is the lowest hanging fruit we have. These patients are already established with our office, they know us and they know they need work, this is way more effective than spending money marketing to people we have never met.

# IMPORTANT:

WRITE GOOD COMLOG NOTES FOR ALL AUDITS

- No alcohol* - The dentist cannot safely sedate you if you have had alcohol, narcotics pain medicines (including Vicodin/Hydrocodone) or any street or recreational drugs.
- No caffeine
- Take no additional medications (e.g. OTC pain medications and antacids, herbal or nutritional supplements) unless discussing these medications with the dentist*
- Nothing to eat after midnight (or 8 hours before procedure), it is Ok to take your medication with some water on the morning of the appointment* - Unless otherwise instructed by the dentist - if your appointment is in the afternoon and you eat the day of please eat a light meal (Note: diabetics eat and take meds as normal)
- No chance of pregnancy
- If prescribed sedation medication for the night before by your dentist take as directed

# The morning of your appointment:

- Take the sedative medication as instructed by the dentist before your appointment*
- NO food or water (except with medication) Eight HOURS prior to your appointment

- Please leave jewelry and watches at home
- No contact lenses
- Wear short sleeves and comfortable clothing
- Wear comfortable shoes/socks
- You will be scheduled to arrive 1 hour prior to starting treatment for the administration of the sedation medication

It is absolutely essential that you have your escort drive you to your appointment. We will not be able to proceed with your appointment if you drive yourself, and this will result in forfeiting your pre-paid fee for the appointment. The person driving the patient must be able to stay with the patient until sedation wears off. (possibly 2-4 hours after arriving home)

*Regrettably, failure to comply with the items marked with an asterisk can compromise the safety of the sedation procedure. In most cases, the dentist will not be able to proceed with your treatment.

# Following Appointment

- No driving for 24 hours after appointment
- No operating hazardous devices
- No heavy lifting
- No Stairs
- No Important decisions

# Escort Information

Today you will supervise the recovery of a sedated patient. The effects of sedation can alter judgment, memory, walking and/or balance for up to several hours after the appointment - Sometimes More. Please be prepared to directly protect the patient from falling or incurring other types of injury. It is easy to become distracted after a period of time, and the patient may attempt getting up to walk without assistance, which could result in the patient falling and incurring an injury.

The patient should not drive any type of vehicle or operate machinery until the next day and only if they feel fully recovered.

Please be sure the patient takes the prescribed medications as directed. It is easy for a sedated patient to get confused and not take their medications as directed (I.E. taking too many medications, the wrong medications, taking at wrong intervals, etc.). In addition, before a patient takes any medication after their appointment, the patient should have eaten something beforehand.

If you have any concerns or questions please immediately call our office at (555)555-5555 and 911 if urgent.

Thank you for your concern and commitment to the safety of our patient.

I _____________________________ have received and understand the written post sedation and post operative instructions provided to me.

- Patients appreciate an explanation of the procedure to be done
- Patients are visual
- Take a HIGH QUALITY intra-oral photo to show the patient the tooth (dry the tooth free of saliva!) take an intra-oral picture of a healthy tooth in their mouth and say this is what a healthy tooth looks like then take a picture of the problematic tooth
- Play a dental education Video
- Get a model
- What is it you were looking for when you were in search of a new dentist?
- When patient asks you what do you think is going on…respond… “well I can’t say for sure, we’ll have to wait for the dentist to know exactly what you need, but it looks like you might need…”
- Most of our Patients choose…
- I’m not going to lie to you, you’ll be very sore, but it’s better than the discomfort you’d have to go through to replace the tooth

# Exam Sheet to become Proficient With

The Office Manager should be familiar with our expectations from the dental assisting team regarding patient workups and hygiene team regarding co-discovery (prepping the patient for the doctor exam). The following 2 images are laminated back to back and situated on the 12 o’clock counter in every restorative op. The assistants fill this out. It has 2 purposes. Firstly, it is a checklist to make sure the assistant has completely set up their room & gathered all of the correct photos and x-rays. Additionally, it tells us why the patient is here. One side is for an existing patient that is here for scheduled treatment and the other side is for a new or existing patient emergency.

# Protocol for When Other Doctor’s Work Needs to be Redone / Is Failing

# Filling or Crown

- Before saying something needs to be redone check the notes, chart, prior x-rays and familiarize with the situation - there’s always a chance it met expectations / expected longevity
- Explain the clinical situation and the reason for needing to redo something.
- Support/back up the Dr that did the work
- Dentistry, like all of medicine, is an imperfect science; complications arise
- “I have seen countless examples of Dr. X’s work doing this very same procedure and I stand by his work 100% of the time, this is an exception and not the norm. He performs this procedure at an extremely high, elite level.”
- We work together as part of a group practice because we believe in each other’s abilities and skills and stand by each other’s treatment
- Come up with a possible reason for the failure/need for re-do without making the Dr look bad.
- Reassure the patient that we will take care of them and we warranty all of our work
- Encourage the patient to schedule with the Dr that did the original treatment
- “Dr. X really knows this clinical situation well, he is really the one that is best qualified to complete the care.”
- Schedule the patient with a corresponding “Renew” code in Open Dental and re-iterate that 100% of the original fee for the procedure will be covered by our office.
- If you are getting the patient to do other work on them, downplay the remake to the patient and make the other doctor aware and redo the treatment for the doctor while you’re doing the other new work on the patient.
- Make a clinical judgment as to the urgency and if it can wait consider waiting and if waiting have the recall with the doctor that did the original work.

# Failing Endo Protocol

- Mitigate patient expectations by saying, “It’s not real obvious what’s going on here- root canal-treated teeth can flare up from time to time. I want to check with Dr. X (whoever did the RCT) because they’re much more familiar with this particular tooth and in the meantime let’s adjust your bite and get you on antibiotics. Often a root canal-treated tooth needs the help of additional systemic antibiotics later on to completely knock down the infection.”
- Adjust bite and prescribe antibiotics
- Tell the Dr who performed the RCT and they will decide how to proceed
- Monitor, Retreat, extract, or refer to endodontist

# Chapter 5

# Verbiage & Phones

# Phone Guidelines

# Keys to a good phone call

- Let the phone ring, stop what you are doing, take a deep breath & smile
- Quickly categorize the call type
- Never say no or can’t or unfortunately
- Never use negative words
- Always try to turn things into a positive (Luckily, the good news is…)
- Practice active listening and empathy
- Your tone is everything: match the patient’s tone or level up the patient to your tone, match the speed they are talking
- Be Friendly, think as though the person calling is going to be your best friend!
- Avoid too much information
- Edification: “I understand you’re nervous, but you’re going to love Dr. Green, we have a lot of nervous patients and he has a gift for making them feel at ease”
- Communication: 55% is non-verbal, 38% is tone, 7% is the words you use

# Answering the phone

“Thank you for calling Green Dental Care, this is _________, How may I help you? Or can I help you?”

1. New Patient: grab new patient sheet & follow the guidelines
2. Emergency Patient: “Oh I’m sorry to hear that, we should definitely have Dr. Green take a look, How soon can you be here?”
3. Price Shoppers

Patient: “Hi, I was wondering, how much do you charge for a Crown/Extraction/Root Canal?”

Receptionist: “Depending on what type of _______ you need the costs can range from ____”

|Crown|800-2000|
|---|---|
|Extraction|300-700|
|Root Canal|600-1700|
---
“Were you told you need a Crown / extraction / root canal ?”

Patient: “yes I was” OR “why can’t you give me an exact price?”

Receptionist: “because there are a lot of factors that determine the price with dental treatment it’s really not fair to you for me to quote you over the phone, it’s best if we get you in for Dr. Green to take a look” OR “We can definitely help you, when was the last time you were in our office?”

Patient: “I will be a new patient”

Receptionist: “Let me be the first to welcome you to our office, how did you hear about us?”

# OUT OF PRICE RANGE:

Delivered in a soft empathetic tone…. “If you’ve found a place that produces the same or better experience and results in a timely manner then you definitely have to consider that, I would encourage you to find out about their warranty and quality of materials they’re using. We’ll be here for you if anything changes.

# 4. Cash patient price shopper

Patient: “hi, I was wondering how much it would cost for a cleaning?”

Receptionist: “I can definitely help you out with that, do you know about our $249 new patient special? so our new patient special includes a cleaning, comprehensive exam and full series of x-rays or what most patients prefer is our Dental Savings Plan, which actually costs less money than dental insurance.”

Patient: “So tell me more about this dental savings plan, what does it include”

Receptionist: “great question, it covers both of your check ups and cleanings for the year including all x-rays, fluoride treatments, and any additional x-rays or emergency visits as well as 15% off all other treatment, it’s really great, I think you’d be very happy with it”

# 5. Insurance Questions

Patient: “Do you accept MetLife”

Receptionist: “Yes we absolutely do, we have a lot of patients with Metlife, do you have Metlife?”

# Out of Network Questions

ONLY IF the patient asks specifically…

Patient: “Are you In Network if Metlife?”

Receptionist: “Luckily for you, your insurance does not dictate what doctor you can go to...We are not IN network with MetLife, however, we Have lots of happy patients with MetLife and typically they don’t have to pay anything out of pocket for their cleanings and checkup appointments.

If the patient keeps asking questions

Patient
---
“Well what if I need other dental work”

Receptionist: “believe it or not they still pay most of our fee, your copay may be slightly higher with us on certain procedures, but I guarantee we will do our best to make it worthwhile.”

If the patient continues to ask questions

“Why don’t at least get you in for a checkup so you can see if our office is a good fit for you”

“Unfortunately Metlife is one of the more difficult insurances to deal with and we’ve seen the list of dentists on the MetLife website for Parker and most of those dentists work at comfort dental, bright now, perfect teeth, and other big dental chains, I can assure you we are the best dental office.”

# 6. Same-Day Crowns

Patient: “Does your office do same-day crowns?”

Receptionist: “Were you told you need a crown?”

Patient: “yes I need a crown and my last dentist did same-day crowns.”

Receptionist: “Patient’s are very happy with Dr. Green’s crowns, he’s tried same-day crowns, but prefers to send them to a lab because the crowns fit better and are stronger, so they last longer.”

Patient: “But I don’t want to have to come back to get it cemented.”

Receptionist: “even though you have to come back the second appointment is easy and quick and your overall time in our office between both appointments is significantly less than the same day crowns.”

# 7. Scheduling a patient outside their requested date

Patient: “I’d really like to make an appointment over Christmas break please.”

Team member: “absolutely, let me just double check to see if I have had any changes that week - I know that the break book up really quickly….you know, I am looking at it, at this time I am all booked up that week, Mary, but I do have an appointment at 4pm on January 6th. Let’s get you plugged in there for now to make sure we get you seen and I’ll make a note so if an opening comes up for break, I will be sure to give you a call.”

- Do not try to guess what they need & offer things that they may not need
- (pt questions the estimate given) “As you may know, we make every attempt possible to obtain accurate INS benefits prior to your appointment; occasionally that information given to us isn’t complete or has been misquoted by the representative.

- Allow silence
- Allow the patient to ask questions or go into what they need
- Do not try to guess what they need & offer things that they may not need
- “We do understand that this is an unexpected balance and we’re happy to do what we can to help with the situation; if you're able to, I’d love to collect a portion over the phone today to credit towards the balance and then I can send a statement for the remainder in a few weeks - does this option work for you today?”

# Helpful Verbiage

It might be a little awkward until we have the reps done right, this gives us the power back in the convo, leads to shorter call times. Patients often come in hot, let’s slow it down.

# Medicaid

Patient: “Do you take medicaid?”

Response: “I can help you with that…How did you hear about our doctors?”

Patient: “Fill in the blank”

Response: “I didn’t get your name”

Patient: “Susie”

Response: “Susie, it’s great to meet you. We are not contracted with medicaid, but the good news is, we have a savings plan for our patients that are on medicaid, and our doctors can get you out of pain today, would you like to be seen today?”

# No Insurance

Patient: “I don’t have insurance can you see me?”

Response: “I can definitely help you with that…How did you hear about our doctors?”

# Insurance

Patient: “Hi, I have Blue Cross Blue Shield do you guys take that?”

Response: “I can help you with that, how did you hear about our doctors?”

# In Network

Patient: “Are you in network with Blue Cross Blue Shield?”

Response: “I can help you with that, how did you hear about our doctors?”

Patient: “Do you accept MetLife”

Receptionist: “Yes we absolutely do, we have a lot of patients with Metlife, do you have Metlife?”

“Let’s go ahead and get you scheduled and in the meantime we have a process where we spend almost an hour getting a thorough breakdown of your plan on your behalf, once that’s done we can call you back and give you an idea of how your coverage might work with our doctors”

# Tricare (verbiage)

Kids go to Dr. Thomas, great we can see parents DSP

Luckily in house savings plan for military

“We’ve done the research and what we discovered is there are no comparable offices to ours that work with tricare”

# Price Shoppers

Patient: “How much is a crown?”

Response: “I can help you with that…How did you hear about our doctors?”

Patient: “my friend Susie, is a patient of yours”

Response: “Oh we love Susie, well I’m sure she told you a little about our office….”

“We find most fees in dentistry are within a close range and we don’t want to quote you too much or too little so let’s bring you in for a consult with our doctor”

Patient: “Why can’t you just tell me the cost of a crown?”

Response: “Our doctors do fantastic work and our prices are fair, but If you’re looking for the cheapest crown in town, our office won’t be a good fit for you, did you want to schedule an appointment to meet Dr. Matt?”

# De-Escalating Patient Situations

I thought I’d share this because it came up in conversation with a doc that I know, and I think the best. Time to visit the things that bring us the most brain damage is when all is well that way if or when a situation does arise (luckily very rarely) we are more prepared and thus can approach the situation with hopefully less stress and more confidence.

Each situation is unique but this is a basic framework.

# Step 1

- Mindset- think “Do I need to be right or do I want to be effective”
- The need to be right so the patient is wrong will almost always escalate a situation faster, so come with the mindset I want to be effective. Being effective looks like the least amount of headache, and least amount of financial and time commitment and I would prioritize time over money here.
---
focused on keeping money in your pocket here, that’s fine, but you will often pay a greater price if you stick your heals in on that mindset.

- Sincere Second Degree Acknowledgement. To de-escalate the patient. This is sometimes all it takes. (refer to link above for training)
- But let’s say we gave our best crack at second degree acknowledgement and that’s just not good enough for this person.
- Carefully document the interaction
- The goal is to de-escalate the situation here and find an amicable solution for all parties. Allow some time for patient to cool-off. Trying to solve a problem while tempers are flared is not the best option.

# Step 2

- If we are in person with patient, we want to avoid talking in circles, which is often what these patients will drag us in to.
- Never get into a back and forth. “This hasn’t gone the way either of us expected or wanted, why don’t we curb the conversation and follow up on a call”
- We can ask their permission that this call is recorded, usually not permissible as evidence but it will help us dictate clear notes of the situation.
- We may get on 1 call with them, but this isn’t going to be a series of calls and emails, typically you want to say less than necessary.
- Let them get into word vomit, not you.
- Depending on the situation or “threat” this may be the time to contact Malpractice carrier for advice.
- Contact Malpractice Carrier: you want to notify the malpractice carrier of a developing situation earlier rather than later. There is no cost to contact them, you simply tell them, “here is the situation that is developing, nothing has happened yet, do you have any advice at this time”
- DO NOT allow for this to turn into an email thread if possible. If it turns this direction and the patient starts making demands via written email, this will automatically trigger malpractice requiring a lawyer to get involved and result in a case being open up on your record.

# Step 3

Depending on the situation, see what options you have to appease the patient to make the situation right in their mind to avoid a lawsuit:

1. Refund the patient?
2. Courtesy treatment/remake?
3. If you have a close relationship with a specialist see what they would be willing to do to help mitigate the situation

Note: Do not make any promises to pay for a patient’s specialty care or any other costs (i.e. time off work, pain, suffering etc). This can be considered a settlement and will need to be reported to the dental board.

# Step 4

Let’s say, a patient threatens that they’ve gotten or will be getting their lawyer involved.
---
Don’t be cavalier about this, but you may calmly let them know…please go ahead and give us your attorney’s number and we’ll give him a call, we’re happy to talk to him. (The tone here is not cocky, but such that, no problem we aren’t scared, neutral demeanor)

# Remember

- Photography, good notes, proper documentation will save your butt
- I would hope there’s no negligence on our part and the consent they signed doesn’t guarantee a result, it just guarantees they were told everything to make an informed decision for themself. We have no idea how

# Addressing Contrast Situations

|Deep Breath:|The are confused:|De-Escalate:|
|---|---|---|
|Control our energy, there is nothing to argue about|where is the miscommunication or misunderstanding|2nd Degree Acknowledgement|

# 2nd degree acknowledgement - they’re loaded for bear and want their feelings validated

1. Action: Hold on, the phone cut out for one second and I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly…
1. You were expecting X
2. But Y happened
3. And WE’RE looking for answers as to what’s going on
2. Impact: “This is not what either of us were expecting, I want you to know we’re taking this seriously”
3. Feeling: “I know this couldn’t feel good for you because it sounds very frustrating”

# AVOID:

1. Talking in circles
2. Answering questions you don’t have the answer to
3. Having to be right

“Ok I’m going to step in right there because this is important”

“I’m looking forward to taking care of this for you”

“Let me put you on a quick hold to see what game they’re (the insurance company) playing”

Pin it back on us against insurance…

“This is what they’re doing to us, here’s what we’ve done to try and get them to do what they’re suppose to, but I see them play this game all the time and I don’t have a lot of confidence that they’re going to do what we expected”

# If Patient needs to be dismissed: refer to Dismissing Red Flag Patients and have Dr. G or OM do that.

# Top 3 things patients call mad about:

1. Insurance didn’t pay something & they have a bill
2. In Network or OON
3. Treatment ?

# Dismissing & Red Flag Patients Protocol

Kindly refer these patients out…

(Luckily 95% of patients are amazing, but we need a strategy to mitigate these negative experiences with the other 5%)

Remember: “They’re just CONFUSED” - always take the high road

# Front Office:

(Referral- Have someone to refer them to that would be a “better fit”)

Screening these patients on the phone. These are usually going to be people that off the bat you can tell are going to be problematic, long winded, asking too many questions, blaming prior dentists, sometimes combative from the start.

Use your best judgment.

Tell them… “Based on what you’re telling me, I don’t want to waste your time, I want you to know our office is probably not the best fit for you, but Dr. ______ also in _____ can take great care of you, his number is 555-555-5555” (if you give them an alternative solution they’re less likely to get mad)

OR - for an existing patient that we’ve denoted as RED FLAG- DO NOT RESCHEDULE or if you thought the patient had left practice already & isn’t welcome back…

(confirm that we have Turned off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders)

# The FIRM approach

… “you know last time you were here we know there were some concerns you had and Dr. XYZ feels this practice might not be the best place for you and we’d like to help you find another dentist…”

# Softer Approach

“Dr. XYZ is booked out for 6 weeks & in these situations it’s very important you are seen right away, Dr ABC will take great care of you…”

# Hygiene:

Do not schedule their recall...put a pop up “RED FLAG -Do Not Reschedule”

Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate
---
Restorative: Do not reschedule patient after final restorative appointment is complete put a pop up “RED FLAG - Do Not Reschedule” Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate

Doctor: if a patient is constantly complaining about the service or the work then perhaps it’s time for them to look for a new dentist. “Our working together just doesn’t make sense, it makes you upset and then it makes me upset because you’re upset, so there’s a doc that I know that I think you’re gonna like- his name is Dr. ABC and Lindsey will get you his phone number…I think he gonna be a better fit for you”

If the Doctor is in the room with a patient that drags them down the path… “Let me bring in the expert” … “I’m gonna go get Lindsey, she’s really the expert here, Lindsey here’s what going on, angry Jim Bob here has some questions about… how can we handle this Lindsey…”- the Treatment coordinator or office manager has already been debriefed on this situation and they know what tools they have in their pocket to resolve the situation whether it’s a refund or referral or discount - the expert will deliver the news/solution - in the future then Lindsey sees the patient smiling “hey Andy what’s going on?”

Dealing with Patients that try to bypass - team to get to Dr. ABC… How to protect yourself from bad reviews… Helpful Verbiage with contrast patients “We shouldn’t do business together. We just shouldn’t do it, it doesn't make sense.” “We haven’t been able to satisfy your needs, this happens…” “We’ve reached the end of our working relationship” (FIRM version) - “tell us where to send your records, if we don’t hear from you, here are some people we could recommend” “What is it exactly that you thought you were expecting but didn’t get from our practice ?” “what were you expecting?” It’s not “what do you need”

Dismissing patients

THE LETTER for Dismissing- dismissal letter is a last resort (try not to have to write a dismissal letter while the fire is hot bc it could make it worse, maybe send it later if you need to but hope that they go elsewhere and self select out…)

Example Dismissal Letter

DATE:

To the Attention of:

Patient Name

Address
---
This letter is to inform you that the team at XYZ dental will no longer be able to provide dental care to you or your family.

We strongly believe that a dentist-patient association built on mutual trust, respect & understanding is vitally important to a patient’s oral health. Over the past several months, it has become apparent that optimal oral health care based upon our treatment recommendations is failing to meet your expectations.

Your current oral health status is quite stable, so for the next 30 days from the date of this letter, we will be available for emergency care only to you and your family. Should this occur, full payment will be expected at the time of service. Should you require a statement from the attending doctor a receipt will be provided for you to submit to your insurance carrier. Once you have located a new dental practice of choice, please fill out the enclosed form required by HIPAA for you to sign and return to us before your records can be sent.

We recommend that you do not hesitate in finding a new provider as preventative and proactive oral health care is the most optimal way to maintain your oral health. Should you have any difficulty in locating a new dentist in your area, you may contact the Colorado Dental Association at 303-740-6900.

Respectfully,
Dr. ABC

# Verbiage for Patients who do not provide us with their insurance info

Goal- get out of the way of the problem that the patient and insurance company have created- we’re here to advocate for our patients, connect them to the problem they created and take responsibility for the situation they’ve created

# To use in messages/texts/calls prior to appointment

- Preferred Option - “I really want to avoid you from being kept waiting by your insurance company. In order to have your appointment run smoothly we need you to respond by [date/time], otherwise we may be better off rescheduling to allow time for your HR department & insurance company to get you the correct information”

# For patients who come to the office without info

- I see here in preparation for seeing you today we reached a few different times to gather your insurance information, were you able to get that to us? Ohhhhhh ok, I’m sorry
- “I’m bummed you weren’t able to get that to us, I’m going to ask Karen to drop everything and gather that information, but it could take up to 45 minutes, you are welcome to hang out in the waiting room or maybe we should have you come back”
---
“I really hate to have to do this, but since we were unable to get your insurance plan verified before your appointment, we’ll need to charge you our full office fees for today’s visit. Once our team is able to determine your plan’s coverage, and insurance pays their part, we can refund the difference back to you.”

“Since our billing team didn’t get the opportunity to check on your insurance coverage before you got here, I’m afraid we can’t be accurate with our cost estimations during your visit. If you’d like to proceed with [treatment] today, we can collect full office fees from you now, and issue you a refund after insurance pays their portion. Otherwise, maybe we should reschedule to another day after we’re able to get in touch with your insurance carrier.”

Yes this issue with Connection that you described is a major issue for anyone dropping any umbrella network. Here is what I recommend you do:

1. Have your Connection Termination acknowledgement letter (that includes your actual Connection Dental termination date) prepared in a pdf copy.
2. Send that letter to any insurance plan that is paying you in-network under Connection and demand that they perform an audit going back to the Connection termination date to reprocess all claims that were incorrectly paid in-network.
3. Warn the dental plan that if they do not comply with this request that you will bring forward legal action and will report their fraud to the State Insurance Commissioner, Department of Justice that oversees ERISA dental plans, and your State Attorney General's Insurance Fraud division. With this warning every insurance plan usually works quickly to correct claims to out of network status as they do not want to deal with government regulators that will impose additional fines for violating insurance laws on the state and federal level.

Follow up with emails with the supervisor so you have time stamped proof.

Work your way up the chain of command.

Once you have a point of contact send them the EOB directly when they make a mistake.

“I need your first and last name and a reference number for your call, please direct me to your supervisor…”

“If we do not receive payment for this claim within 7 business days we will instruct the patient to file a claim with the state insurance board, thank you”

“We have made a claim to the state insurance board and your late payment will result in interest charges”

- NEVER EVER SAY OUR POLICY
- Discomfort NOT pain

First of all, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of one of our dear friends and mentor Alastair Macdonald. Alastair has shared many great concepts for handling difficult conversations with patients. At the top of the list is tricky insurance conversations with patients. Littered throughout this chapter are ideas from Alastair that have helped our practices (and many others) minimize the negative outcomes that can be associated with insurance companies not doing what they say they will and thus patients being upset with us. We have found with proper delivery of some of the verbiage shared in this chapter, patients will understand these situations for what they are and not look to blame us for all of their unmet insurance related expectations.

# Dealing with patients that are trying to blame us BUT really they are upset with insurance…

“Ok, so this morning Ingrid spent 45 minutes on the phone with your insurance company getting as much info out of them as she could, based on that conversation Ingrid had with your insurance this is what I estimate this treatment will cost, however, based in my experience with Cigna, I want you to know there is ample reason to expect these guys to behave badly, unfortunately Cigna has a history of coming back and making YOUR life miserable…”

“Now remember we already extend a XXX% discount to you so you don’t have to worry about that, but I know these guys and more often than not they are gonna come back and pay less in fact what myself & friends that work at other dental offices report seeing lately is they’re paying based on fees far below industry standards- that’s why the ADA is suing insurance companies like Humana - so don’t be surprised if this happens. So here’s what we are gonna do, after this discount (the in network discount), we are going to go with this amount here (circle it and initial) and let’s watch what happens. If there is one thing you and I both know it’s that insurance companies will never show up the way you or I expect them to. So in the event they come back and don’t pay as much as we are expecting, this will be infuriating to me so first I’ll go and sit down with Ingrid and we will go to battle for you and issue an appeal with them, but if we lose that battle we may need to work out a payment plan or something, we just can’t plan for all scenarios with these guys. SO fingers crossed, they’re not going to do this to US. 80% of the time we get the estimate perfect but it’s that 20% of the time that insurance doesn’t pay what we expect that causes major headaches for our patients”

# Additional helpful Verbiage

“We do everything we can to protect you from these guys but they’re still brutal”

“Remember it doesn’t matter what metropolis in the world you fly into - the tallest buildings in the world are insurance companies, so these parasites are screwing us all over, this is exactly how they pay for those tall buildings”

“We are very insurance friendly but we look at dental insurance as a coupon book…”

191
---
“We do everything we can to outsmart these guys and get accurate estimates for you, but ultimately it still is only an estimate”

“We constantly update your plan info and spend lots of time researching how we can maximize your benefits…”

“Insurance maximums have been $1,000 since 1970, 50 years”

# Additional Insights

1. Assume any errors are errors of understanding - patients don’t understand that these numbers are the insurance companies’ numbers - the numbers I’ve given you are in good faith from our research with your insurance company. (Get out of the way of your patient and their insurance company - matador) these figures are not my figures, these are YOUR insurance companies figures. I am simply the person that is holding the piece of paper so don’t kill the messenger. We’ve gone in and plugged the treatment plan in with what YOUR insurance company has shared with us about YOUR policy and here is what they tell us it will cost. If you’ve been alive as an adult for any amount of time then you’re aware you can’t trust an insurance company as far as you can throw them. We know insurance companies are prone to changing their minds so be aware we take these figures from your insurance company with a hefty grain of salt. This is a process and we will keep you informed of things as we go but this is our starting data. We’ll keep you posted if anything changes and we ask you to do the same.
2. Expectations: let’s keep in touch. If either of us get any information that doesn’t fit these expectations let’s let each other know. We’ve got some tricks backstage, Ingrid is an absolute ninja and we’ll see what we can do if they behave badly. We are being burned for what the insurance company did to them.
3. Response to a review about insurance: First of all that you’ve taken a chance to come see us and you had such a good experience that you came back makes me feel good about the work we do and the work that we are responsible for but for those out there that are reading this insurance companies do this to us ALL THE TIME. If you’re reading this they’ve done it to you too, somewhere along the line. My team and I continue to work on this case of one more empty promise from a large insurance company that said they’d pay for something that they now won’t. Thanks for giving us a chance to do what we do best, your dental work. We’re sorry that this happened.

# Out-Of-Network Q & A

Q: Will I still be able to be treated in your office as a patient?
---
# Insurance Information

# Q: Will it cost me more to come to your office once I move to out-of-network status?

A: Honestly, we don’t know. The insurance company will not share that information with us. It is possible that care in our office will have some minor differences in cost, but most of our patients tell us that the patient experience and high quality of service are well worth the small difference in fees.

# Q: Are my benefits going to change?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: Do I have to do anything differently?

A: Not at all. We will continue to treat you in our office and process your claims like we always have. With respect to any treatment needs that you may have, our financial coordinators will help you utilize your dental benefits to their fullest.

# Q: If I am unable to switch my plan and want to continue care in your practice, what options do I have?

A: We would love to still have you come to our office for your dental care. We are very insurance friendly and will continue to provide you with the support you've come to expect from us with respect to handling claims for your provider.

If you have the ability to choose a dental option we recommend our comprehensive in-office Dental Savings Plan (DSP). Our program allows you to have all of your basic check-ups and cleaning services for the year for one low price. All other dental needs receive a 15% discount.

# Q: Are you in network with my insurance? (NEW PATIENT CALL)

A: "Let me be the first to welcome you to our practice. It is a pleasure to meet you by phone and I look forward to meeting you in person here real soon. Although we are not contracted with your insurance company directly we work with many patients who come to see us with your same insurance plan. We have a team dedicated to insurance who will help you use your benefits to their fullest each year.

# Doctor/Patient OON Conversation

"Steve, I wanted to take a minute to give you some information about some important things that are happening in the practice this year. We have done a lot of research over the past few years and have made the very difficult decision to relinquish our preferred provider status with your dental insurance company starting (date).

Every one of our patients is extremely important to us, you are extremely important to us, which is why I wanted to have this conversation with you personally. Working with (Ins Company Name) has been extremely time consuming, more restrictive, and more expensive for our patients. We simply cannot offer the quality of care that we insist on by remaining in your plan's network and we will never compromise the quality of your dental care.

The good news is that you can continue to come to our office. We have set things up to still estimate and submit claims to your carrier on your behalf just as we always have. Your day-to-day visits will be the same and we will continue to do everything we can to help you maximize your insurance benefits each year should you choose to stay with your same carrier.

I also want to make you aware of our cost-effective in-office Dental Savings Program (DSP). If you would like to change your dental plan or ever find yourself without dental insurance we would love to have you in our program. We are sending a few pieces of information home with you today that provide some further information. I encourage you to read through them when you have time."

What questions do you have?"

# Q: Will it cost me more to come to the office?

A: Honestly, we don't know. It is entirely possible that it will cost you a little bit more. With some plans there is virtually no change for you the patient. Either way, we hope that you will appreciate the relationship we have built over time, the quality of the dentistry performed here, the approach to care where we would never recommend something that is not in your best interest, and the individual attention with personal touches. We hope that those things are reason enough to continue to allow us to care for your dental needs.

# Dental Analogies

# Tooth Fractures

- Having a fracture in your tooth is like driving with a bald tire waiting for a blowout
- Bulging tire analogy. Everyone knows a bald tire is on a continuum and about to blow. Bulging tires sneak up on you and seemingly have no rhyme or reason
- "Can't we just put a filling in there again?" Not really. A filling is just what it says it is. You have a cavity, so you remove the decay and now you have a hole. So you fill it with something so you don't get stuff stuck in there. But a filling never strengthens the tooth. The tooth supports the filling. Once you have more filling than tooth, the tooth can no longer support the filling, so we start to see cracks and chips.
---
This typically happens when the filling material is about half of the biting surface of the tooth. (show pt tooth in mirror or I/O pic) Your tooth is well past this point. See these cracks? You're kinda on borrowed time already. Let's fix this before it breaks and we can't restore it.

- A filling will seal the crack temporarily but it’s like using a bandaid to repair a leaking dam....something's gonna give, its just matter of time.....really depends on your risk tolerance (again most patients opt to crown).
- A crack in your tooth is no different than a crack in your windshield....it starts off small and eventually spreads until you ultimately have to replace the windshield.....(anchor to tooth loss offer crown).
- Filling vs crown.....”we can can fill your tooth....it’ll be cheaper and quicker but it’s temporary and the tooth can still break (goal is to get a no because it’s not the superior treatment option)....or we can crown the tooth: the crown is more expensive (address the elephant in the room) but it will prevent your tooth from breaking in half or causing you pain. (This method on paper may sound like it sucks but it works well because it addresses the higher cost and elicits the negative emotion associated with pain/infection).
- Fillings and crowns are like tires for your car, you only get so much use out of them before you need to replace them.
- I/O shows crack. Why can't you just do a filling? It’s like putting super glue on a cracked windshield...I don’t know when its gonna give, but it will give. Hopefully, we can still do a crown on that day and not something more expensive. Should we fix it with a crown today?
- “John do you see this crack right here (IO photo/problem)....cracks can spread into the nerve and cause pain or infection....if they spread below the gums the tooth needs to come out (consequence)....so we place a cap/crown on the tooth to hold it together (solution)” (stop talking: let the patient ask questions, let the left brain analytical go to town while the others typically accept treatment).
- Everyone’s practice philosophy varies. I don't wanna step on any toes here, I have found amalgam removal to be a controversial topic....but we remove almost all amalgam fills.....the majority have cracks in the teeth. “These fillings are metal and they contain mercury in them...just like the old thermometers....they used mercury in the thermometers because it was so sensitive to temperature changes....when the filling heats up in your mouth it expands.....it’s like driving a small wedge into the tooth and causes little cracks (we use our hands and IO photos to demonstrate.....when it cools it contracts and causes leakage....again using marginal defects in IO photos to demonstrate).

# Hygiene

- The gum therapy can remove the plaque clinging to your teeth like barnacles on a ship, but that plaque was also touching your gums. Instead of cutting away your gums with a sharp surgical blade, we use a laser light to zap just those diseased areas to increase healthy gum formation and decrease sensitivity. -- It's like using a knife to get the peanut butter out of a jar, you can really get a lot, but we all know there's some sticking to the sides that will never come out. That's what the laser does for us.
- I like that I use a similar saying for cleanings. I let them know your cleaning is like your oil change. I can give you a Bentley but it’s not going to last 200k miles if you beat it up and don’t get your scheduled maintenance.
- I also use “barnacles on a boat” to describe calculus. You can’t just pull a barnacle off a boat, you have to use an instrument to physically scrape it off. It’s the same for the hardened bacteria under your gums... a regular cleaning won’t take it off but the hygienists can remove it with special instruments.
- I always relate periodontal health to the foundation of a house. “We need to make sure the ‘foundation’ is healthy and strong before concentrating on the teeth that use the bone for support.”

# Bruxism

- Tooth is like a pumpkin: hard outer layer, softer inner and then the goop in the middle..the hard outer layer is enamel, the softer inner we call dentin and the goop in the middle is the nerve....you have worn.
---
# Dental Explanations

# Tooth Wear

Your teeth down to the softer second layer.....getting closer to the nerve (show them in a mirror, use IO photos, and have them bring the teeth together to line up the wear facets while looking in a mirror. This is powerful): this can be used to discuss night guards, ortho (functional aspect), and potentially crowns if the clinical situation calls for it.

Tooth is like an M&M and they've worn past the CandyShell and now they're into the soft chocolate.

# Immediate Dentures

I am making your new plate to fit your current jaw and I’ll have to make some guesses. Say your jaw is like your feet. The day I extract the teeth, if your jaw is a size 11.5, the denture has to be at least a 12 for me to fit it in. After a few months, it will be a 10 or maybe an 8. Then we can reline it which is like putting more socks on, or remake it to fit better.

Immediate denture is like putting from 100 feet. We will get it closer, but no way we aren't going to need to putt again.

For females, I say dentures are like a wedding dress and multiple fittings before the big day, as your gums heal and change so will the fit of your dentures. You’ll need a couple of fittings over time until it’s just right.

# Root Canals

I use this when patients ask why a crown is necessary after a root canal - Ever touch a tree that lost its water supply? The bark just comes off and crumbles. That’s the same as a root canal treated tooth. You not only remove the nerve but also the blood vessels. And just like the tree the tooth will crumble so let’s put that protective cover on the tooth.

A root canal treated tooth is like a tree stump that’s been hit by lightning.....it’s dead, dry and brittle....It’s roots are still there and anchored but it’s fragile.....(pcss and recc crown).

# Orthodontics

When patient only wants to do one arch: That’s like only changing one shoe at a time, you won’t walk properly and over time, you may never walk properly again without surgery.

Occlusal issues and force distribution problems: Like the front end of your car being out of alignment. Minor situations, your tires wear early, moderate, you're wearing bearings and struts, severe, your steering wheel is shaking while you drive down the road. Support conversation with IO of abfraction enamel crazing wear facets and radiographs of joint wear.

IPR - we gently smooth the rough sides of some of the teeth to create spaces as thick as a contact lens so all your teeth can line up like soldiers.

# Sleep Apnea

CPAP is using air to blow and keep the tube open. An oral device is like a car jack to keep your tongue from closing the hole.

# Onlays

It’s like a perfectly fitting puzzle piece made of tooth colored material that replaces the broken part of your tooth. And it lasts longer than fillings made of plastic.

# Treatment Planning

The way I see it is you’re driving and I'm navigating. We'll go as quickly or as slowly as you want to go, and I'll keep you away from any major pitfalls. We can get right to where we want to go or take the scenic route. It doesn't matter to me.

I always say that teeth are like a 30 year roof...at some point you will probably have a couple of leaks.

# Verbiage: Dental Procedure Scripts

# Crowns

(always use an intraoral photo of the patients tooth that is recommended for a crown)

“You see this tooth here Mrs. Jones, I want you to know I am concerned about this tooth and I am concerned because with the size of this filling here the tooth is very susceptible to fracturing and I don’t want you to have a dental emergency where the tooth breaks and we have to do a root canal or even worse if it breaks so bad we have to extract it”

Wait and listen “so what do we need to do ?”

“Mrs. Jones, I would recommend that we put a crown or a cap on this tooth to protect it from breaking. You see a crown will cover the tooth 360 degrees, a crown is the artificial replacement of the enamel outer surface of your tooth and it looks and feels just like your tooth but it will strengthen it”

# Root Canal, Build Up, Crown

“When you have pain from a tooth it is either because there is a cavity into the nerve, an infection from the tooth or gums or a cracked tooth. A root canal is done to get you out of pain and help you keep the tooth. In each tooth there are main nerves like the trunks of a tree and then a bunch of tiny branches that extend from them. We clean out and fill the nerve so that

# Fillings

“Sensitivity following tooth colored fillings is completely normal. Many times teeth are not sensitive at all, but it is very common for one tooth or a few teeth to be sensitive to chewing & hot and cold for a few weeks up to several months, it WILL get better with time.”

“If your bite feels off we would like to see you to adjust your bite, if the bite is ok just know it will get better with time”

# Implant vs. Bridge

Use Blue Sky Bio Patient education video as necessary

# Oral Sedation

(When sedation is required we use oral sedation 99% of the time. Oral Sedation works great for wisdom teeth extractions, implants, root canals, anxiety. If a patient insists on IV sedation that is perfectly fine we can bring a dental or nurse anesthesiologist in for $600 for the first 90 minutes then $50 for every 15 minutes after that. Our primary contact for IV sedation is Royce Fishell he can be reached at 303-921-3181 option two is Ryan 307-421-0101)

“Most of our patients with anxiety or patients that need a longer procedure done find oral sedation to really work well. With oral sedation you’ll have a family member drive you here and take you home, we will give you all of the instructions but we ask you to fast for 8 hours then we have you get here an hour early we get you nice and comfy, all set up with a movie on netflix and give you some medicine that you take by mouth. Once it kicks in you don’t care that we are doing dental work on you and most people don’t even remember the procedure. Oral sedation is very safe because you are still conscious. You aren’t necessarily asleep but you are so relaxed that you will doze in and out.”

# Night Guards: Bruxism / Recession / Abfractions / Sensitivity

“Many people grind their teeth, in fact a lot of us here at the office wear night guards for that reason. In your case you are showing signs of clenching and grinding, a night guard will act like a shock absorber so you aren’t putting so much force on your teeth and jaw joints. Clenching and grinding leads to recession and sensitivity and even chipping of your teeth at the gumline. Some people grind during the day while driving, working out or working on the computer, but most people also clench and grind in their sleep and aren’t even aware of it.”

# Dental Savings Plan

# Hygiene Explanations

# Gingivitis:

Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. I am getting some measurements that are reading 4mm. This means the tissue is red, inflamed and swollen. Bleeding is also a sign of bacteria under the gum line that we need to clean out. There could be certain points in your cleaning that it is a little bit uncomfortable, but we would like to get the inflammation down and the bleeding to lessen. If we don’t then we might need to do a deep cleaning.

# Periodontal Disease:

Healthy gum measurements are between 1-3mm. We consider these measurements healthy because your toothbrush and floss can get into the pockets to clean these at home. 4mm pockets are considered gingivitis and 5mm and above are considered periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is bacteria underneath the gum line that causes bleeding and bone loss. We can try to prevent the pockets and bone loss from getting worse. The bone unfortunately will not grow back, but the pockets and tissue health can improve.

# SRP:

A deep cleaning consists of getting numb to perform a thorough cleaning. We go under the gum line to the bottom of the pocket and clean out the bacteria and build up. We are hoping for less inflammation, bleeding and reattachment of the pockets. Once we are finished with the deep cleaning we like to have you come back for maintenance cleanings more regularly to see how the pockets are healing and monitor the bone loss.

# Arestin:

Arestin is a localized antibiotic that is placed into a deeper pocket to help get rid of the bacteria and help heal the pocket back to a healthy measurement. It is a powder that adheres to the tissue and it stays down in the pocket for 28 days, you can floss and waterpik like normal but do not be too vigorous in that area.

# Cavitron:

This is a tool that looks like all of my other instruments but it uses vibration and water to help me clean your teeth. It is great because it flushes out some of the bacteria underneath the gum line and vibrates the build up off. It uses less pressure than traditional instruments so most patients like it better. If there is sensitivity please let me know.

# Whitening Trays:

We make whitening trays here in the office. We do impressions of your mouth and make trays that are custom to your teeth. Once we take the impressions you can come back and pick up your trays the following day if the
---
office is open. For optimal whitening you can whiten everyday or every other day for a week or two until desired whiteness. Then you can keep the trays for touch ups down the road. You just need to put a dot of whitening gel in each tooth that you can see in your smile and leave the trays in for about an hour. It is normal to have some sensitivity after whitening.

# Recession/ Abfractions:

Areas of recession are located where the gum line and teeth meet. These areas are exposing the root surface of the tooth. The root surface is not as strong as the enamel which is the part of the tooth that we see and can be very sensitive. These areas are mainly caused by clenching and grinding. It is like a fence post, if the soil is here and you keep moving the board back and forth the soil around the bottom will start to move away and make the board loose and not stable in the ground. It is the same with our teeth. If we keep “knocking”, so clenching and grinding, our gums and bone will start to recede.

(To help this problem I would recommend a night guard and fluoride. The night guard will help the wear on your teeth and the fluoride will help the areas of exposed root surface from getting decay and will also lessen sensitivity.)

# Fluoride

“We recommend fluoride to all of our patients because it has so many benefits for keeping your teeth strong and healthy. Fluoride helps prevent any new cavities and protect your current fillings and crowns, it also helps with any sensitivity especially in areas of recession. The areas of recession are also more prone to decay because it is not as strong as the enamel. It looks like it’s only 25 for today if you want to take advantage of the fluoride treatment”

# VERBAL SKILLS

Verbal skills are critical! If our communication skills are weak, there is a strong possibility our patients will never experience our clinical skills. It is essential that we understand what we are talking about and how to present information to the patient is such a way that it puts them at ease and instills confidence that we will treat them with kindness, using the latest dental technology to ensure the most comfortable and excellent treatment possible.

Our patients need to know that we care about them personally before they are able to hear how we can help them clinically. Begin relationship building from the very first contact. We can begin with a short 3 minute conversation as we begin the appointment. Ask about your patient’s interests. Please make note of them on the top of the patient intake form.

Explain that since this is their first visit, we will be gathering information, including photos and x-rays, that will go into our records and assist us in assessing the oral health.

When taking intra-oral photos with patients, clear, focused photos are important. Practice will enable you to take them quickly and clearly.
---
“We will evaluate your existing fillings to determine how well they are holding up. If they are still holding up, we will not recommend replacing them. If they are beginning to breakdown, we will talk about options. This process helps you see what we see and helps us eliminate most dental emergencies by being able to see what is beginning to break down before it is advanced.”

If patients have not had dental treatment for a few years or have extensive treatment needs, we explain that we will help them see what needs to be taken care of and that we can break it down into a plan that works for them. It is our job to let them know what needs they have, what options are available, both clinically and financially and that they will be the ones who make the decision as to how they want to proceed. “We are here for you.”

Three basic kinds of restorations are fillings, inlays/onlays, and crowns. The type of restorations recommended is based upon the amount of sound tooth structure remaining. Fillings are bonded into the preparation. Inlays/onlays are used when there is not enough tooth structure remaining to support a filling, but enough left that it doesn’t need the full coverage of a crown. The greatest amount of support is a crown, which covers the full tooth. It is made of gold, ceramic or porcelain.

Whenever possible, the hygienist should review them with patient, pointing out areas of concern that they will want to discuss with doctor when he does exam. This helps them begin to understand the condition of their dental health and helps them mentally prepare for accepting the treatment they needs.

# RESTORATIONS:

# FILLINGS - USED TO TREAT DECAY.

1. AMALGAM/METAL/”SILVER”
2. COMPOSITE/WHITE/PORCELAIN

# CROWNS/CAPS – USED TO TREAT TEETH WHICH NO LONGER HAVE ENOUGH STRUCTURAL SUPPORT FOR FILLINGS. USUALLY FRACTURED TEETH, TEETH WITH LARGE DECAY, OR TEETH THAT HAVE HAD AN ‘ENDO’

2. CANTILEVER BRIDGE – 2 ABUTMENTS WITH A PONTIC ON THE END. USUALLY REPLACES A 2ⁿᵈ MOLAR.
3. MARYLAND BRIDGE – ONLY THE PONTIC CROWN, WHICH IS CEMENTED TO THE BACK OF TWO TEETH ON EITHER SIDE.

“Normally we’d collect $100 per hour to reserve that time with Dr. Green, but since your patient portion ends up as less than that, we can just collect the full $XX.XX”.

To assure we allot the appropriate appointment time with Dr. Green, we do require a deposit of $100 per hour to reserve this time with him.

No matter how full the schedule is in reality, we want to indicate that Dr. Green’s time is limited and valuable.

“I’d really like to find a way to keep you on the schedule today to help you avoid the last minute appointment change fee”

“yes we require 48 business hours for any appointment changes to avoid the $129 fee”

After this if they absolutely Must change appt.

“Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# First Offense

“Yeah the appointment you had is really prime real estate, but I understand emergencies do happen so I will go ahead and take care of that for you today, but please remember we do appreciate at least 48 business hours notice in the future”

# Second Offense (within 18 months)

“Yeah you had a real prime appointment time, I’m really not suppose to do this, but I’ll go ahead and take care of this a second time”

“To book another appointment a credit card will need to be kept on file in case of another last minute change”

- Collect Credit Card info on proper form
- Book them 4 weeks or more out during non-prime hours
- Break the appointment properly using “Cancellation Protocol - What to do with the Appt”
- Put a note in the appt. “RSX2 & DO NOT move patient up to come in sooner #DND#”
- Post $129 charge (missed/late cancelled appt) and adjustment (2nd missed/late cancelled appt)
- Print statement & mail to patient with 2nd failure letter (scan into chart & make comlog notes)

# Third Offense (within 2 years)

Charge appointment change fee, inform patient DO NOT rebook

“Ok, we will go ahead and collect that appointment change fee and if there’s ever a day you can come in call us the day of and we will let you know if we can squeeze you in”

- Break the appointment properly using “Cancellation Protocol - What to do with the Appt”
- Post $129 charge (missed/late cancelled appt) & charge the card on file
- Put a Pop-Up “CHRONIC CANCELLATION OFFENDER: same day appointments ONLY”
- If they try to call and schedule a not same day appt. Tell them there are no open appointments right now, but you could call them on the day they had in mind IF something opens up and make a note on that day indicating this (DO NOT MAKE them an appt. In open dental)

# Cancellation Fee Rules

First and foremost we must use the dummy column for unconfirmed appointments - we must decide if texting them that if they don’t confirm and if we don’t hear from you it’s $129 we will give it to someone else gives them an “excuse”

# First Offense

Same protocol- emergencies come up, we tell them “I can take care of that $129 late cancellation notice for you this time, but next time we will have to charge you the $129”

And send out the letter and adjusted statement

209
---
If they say “I know you need to charge me the cancellation fee…” tell them “Ok I can go ahead and take your card for that”

# Second Offense

Charge patient $129 - take down their credit card for if there is a 3rd offense

# Third Offense

Charge patient $129. This is not a quality patient. They can call us for same day appointments. Put “Do NOT AUDIT- chronic canceller” in pop up

# New Patient - Second Offense

whether hygiene or restorative appointment - appoint them on Doctor side for 30 minutes

“Yeah you know we had Michelle’s time blocked for you for that 90 minute new patient cleaning so let’s get you in to get exam and x-rays and get you back into the cue for a cleaning”

“Alternatively we could collect you patient portion now to reserve that 90 minute new patient cleaning and refund you after insurance pays”

“Yes that would be a non-refundable deposit”

# How to Properly Break an Appointment

# What To Do With An Appointment When A Patient Cancels

# Sample Appointment Failure Letter

We are writing in regards to your missed/rescheduled appointment. A missed/reschedule dental appointment presents problems for us both. For you, a missed/reschedule dental appointment causes a delay in treatment to help improve your dental health. For our office, a missed/reschedule dental appointment prevents us from scheduling another patient that could benefit from treatment. We schedule individual time with each patient to allow us to deliver the quality, personal care that every patient deserves.

As part of our financial policy, we charge $129 for each missed or rescheduled appointment with less than 48 business hours’ notice. This time, we have waived this fee as a courtesy. We still want to take a moment to review our financial policy.

We thank you for your trust and patronage at our office, but please understand that we schedule time in our schedule to be with you, and we would appreciate it if you honored that time we have set aside. For the future, we are simply going to ask you to be very faithful about keeping all dental appointments.
---
We understand that things happen, and schedules do change and we ask that in the future you provide us with at least 48 business hours’ notice for any appointment changes. Failure to provide at least a 48 business-hour notice for changed appointments will result in missed appointment charges and eventual dismissal from the practice.

We value you as a patient and look forward to seeing you for future appointments.

In good health,
The Team at XYZ dental

# Sample Appointment Failure Letter # 2

We are writing in regards to your recent missed appointments. There have been multiple appointments now that we have not received 48 business hours notice from you. We value you as a patient and would like to continue to provide you the care that you deserve. Our policy is to charge $129 dollars per missed appointment.

Going forward, we will require that you call us to see if we have any same day appointments available.

A missed/rescheduled dental appointment presents problems for us both. For you, a missed/rescheduled dental appointment causes a delay in treatment to help improve your dental health. For our office, a missed/rescheduled dental appointment prevents us from scheduling another patient that could benefit from treatment. We schedule individual time with each patient to allow us to deliver the quality, personal care that every patient deserves.

We hope that you understand our goal of this policy is not to get “something for nothing,” but rather to provide the best care by having efficient scheduling that serves all of the members of our community.

We value you as a patient and look forward to seeing you for future appointments.

# GREEN DENTAL CARE FINANCIAL POLICY

# Assignment and Release

I the undersigned assign directly all insurance benefits to Green Dental Care, if any, otherwise payable to me for services rendered. I understand that I am financially responsible for all charges whether or not paid by insurance. I hereby authorize the practice to release all information necessary to secure the payment of benefits.

Date: _______________           Signature: ____________________________________________

Signature of patient/parent/legal guardian

# Patient Agreement and Financial Policy

I hereby agree to be responsible for the costs of care provided by Green Dental Care and/or the dental team for myself or my dependent(s). These include any deductibles and amounts not covered by insurance. I also understand that it is my responsibility to be aware of any limitations, and benefits of my insurance policy. Payment to this office is my responsibility and I am aware that if the insurance company does not reimburse the practice, I am responsible for the total amount(s).

# Payment

Green Dental Care requires that payment be rendered on the date of service. We will estimate the amount of copay required from the information that your insurance company provides to us. Please keep in mind that while we make every effort so that these estimates are accurate, we cannot possibly be correct 100% of the time due to the many clauses and stipulations that are inherent in the individual policies. In other words, every policy is unique, and the estimate is not a contract. In the case that your insurance company pays less than we estimate, you will be responsible for the balance.

I understand after 30 days of receipt of a statement from Green Dental Care, any unpaid balance will incur a 1% per month billing fee. I understand that failure to pay amounts due to this office will result.

# Credit Card on File Policy

We strive to provide the highest quality dental care and ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all of our patients. To this end, we have implemented a policy requiring a credit card on file for all patients effective 11/1/2024. We will now start securely collecting a credit card at time of your appointment to streamline payments for copays, deductible, non-covered services, late and no-show fees. We will notify families of any balances after insurance payments are received and before we process any transactions. Some insurance plans require deductibles and copayments in amounts not known to you or us at the time of your visit. Much like many other businesses such as a hotel or car rental agency, we now have a similar policy where we ask for a credit card number at the time you check in.

Circumstances when your card would be charged include but are not limited to:

- Any co-payments, deductible and/or co-insurance not collected from you at your visit.
---
Missed or canceled appointments without 48-hour notice (per our Broken Appointment Policy)

Any non-covered services and/or denial or services allocated to patient responsibility

Any insurance payments sent to the subscriber/patient instead of to our office

Outstanding balances greater than 90 days

Please note that patient families will still retain the right to dispute a charge or question your insurance policy’s determination of payment.

By signing below you confirm that you have read our financial policy and consent to us drafting the credit card on file to take care of the unpaid balance less than $150. Before ever charging anything to your credit card, you will be notified via email or text message 48 hours prior, in case you would like to make another arrangement for payment.

Date: _______________           Signature: ____________________________________________

Signature of patient/parent/legal guardian

# Appointment Policy

I understand that because appointments are not double-booked, I must provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. For appointments with a doctor scheduled for 60 minutes or longer, I will be required to make a reservation fee of $100 per hour prior to scheduling the appointment, which will be applied to my out-of-pocket expense for that appointment. This reservation fee is non-refundable. If I do not show up for my appointment or I do not give adequate notice if I am unable to keep my appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited.

For all appointments where a reservation fee is not required, a $129 cancellation fee will apply if I do not provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time.

We understand your lives are busy and as a courtesy to our patients, we reach out via Text, Email and/or Phone to confirm all appointments. It is critical that you respond to confirm your appointment. For any appointments not confirmed 48 business hours prior to your appointment time, we have to assume you are forfeiting that appointment and we will start to open up that valuable time slot to other patients. (FOR EXAMPLE: if your appointment is Monday @ 1pm, you must confirm by Thursday prior @ 1pm.)

# Internal Financial Guidelines

# Effective May 1, 2018

Desired Outcome: Consistent and complete collection of all payments the day of treatment. Maintaining a collection percentage of 96% or above.

Measurement: Review of the schedule at the end of the day to compare expected payments to payments received.

# 1. PAYMENT POLICY FOR NEW PATIENTS, EMERGENCY PATIENTS AND EXISTING PATIENTS:

- Payment is due at the time service is rendered for all services $250 and under. This includes any co-payments due from patients with dental insurance coverage.
- We accept cash, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit and debit cards. Although we do accept checks as a form of payment, we will use that as a last resort and only if the patient does not have another form of payment.
- Patients may leave a credit card on file for residual balances after insurance payment is received. We will contact the patient prior to charging the card as a courtesy.
- If the patient pays in full for services with cash at least 3 business days prior to the appointment in which their out-of-pocket expense is $1,000 or more we will extend a 5% courtesy discount. If they pay with credit or debit card, we will extend a 3% courtesy discount. This DOES NOT apply to patients who have a PPO insurance that we are in-network with. This courtesy may be extended to a patient who comes in for emergency treatment and could not have possibly pre-paid for treatment.
- If the patient pays in full for services with cash at least 3 business days prior to the appointment in which their out-of-pocket expense is between $300 and $999, we will extend a 5% courtesy discount. If they pay with credit or debit card a 3% courtesy discount will be extended. This DOES NOT apply to patients who have a PPO insurance that we are in-network with. This courtesy may be extended to a patient who comes in for emergency treatment and could not have possibly pre-paid for treatment.
- Patients requesting a payment plan will be directed to apply through Lending Club or Care Credit.
- An internal payment plan may be extended to a patient (after the practice has been open for 6 months). The patient must put down 25%, leave a credit card on file for 3 monthly payments of 25% each. The patient will incur a billing fee of $10 after 60 days if they choose this option.
- Internal payment plans may be extended to patients having orthodontic treatment. The patient must put a deposit down of $2,000 prior to beginning treatment and the remaining balance can be paid in six (6) monthly payments. The patient MUST keep a credit card on file for automatic monthly payments. This payment plan cannot exceed six (6) months.
- For multi-staged procedures, 50% payment is due at the first appointment and 50% will be due at the delivery appointment.

All treatment fees will be presented to the patient in writing and we will obtain a signature before scheduling treatment regardless of the dollar amount or insurance coverage. Copies of the financial arrangement will be scanned into the patient’s account and a copy will be given to the patient.
---
# 2. INSURED PATIENTS

- Prior to the patient’s appointment, we will check eligibility for all insured patients.
- We will estimate any co-payments and deductibles to the best of our ability.
- We will submit claims to primary and secondary insurance ONLY, unless required by contract for a third or fourth insurance.
- Insured patients will be required to pay any co-payments at the time services are rendered.
- Patients will be educated that regardless of insurance coverage, they are responsible for all charges incurred.
- As a rule, we will submit pre-treatment estimates for implants.
- We will submit the pre-treatment estimate to the insurance company and we will schedule the patient for 45 days out.
- Patients will be educated about the need or lack thereof pre-estimates.

# 3. APPOINTMENT RESERVATIONS, LATE CANCELLATIONS AND BROKEN APPOINTMENTS:

- For appointments that are 90 minutes in length or longer the patient will be required to put down a $100 reservation fee prior to scheduling the appointment.
- The reservation fee is non-refundable, if the patient does not provide adequate notice (2-business days) to cancel or reschedule their appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited. If the patient comes in for their appointment, the reservation fee will be applied towards the patient’s out-of-pocket co-payment.
- For appointments less than 90 minutes in length, if adequate notice (2-business days) is not given, a $50 cancellation fee may apply.
- The cancellation fee will be waived after the first offense (the fee will be applied to the account and adjusted off).
- At the doctor’s discretion, the cancellation fee may be waived upon the second offense. The patient may be asked to pay a reservation fee after the second offense to schedule another appointment. The reservation fee will be determined by Dr. Green on a case-by-case basis.
- At the third consecutive offense, the fee will stand, and the patient may be dismissed from the practice.
- Dr. Green MUST authorize the dismissal of a patient from the practice.

# 4. FINANCE CHARGES AND BILLING FEES:

- We will not be applying finance charges to accounts with outstanding balances.
- There will be a $10 billing fee applied to all accounts with balances outstanding 60 days or more.

# 5. RETURNED CHECKS:

- There will be a $50 charge applied to all accounts in which a check payment is returned.
- The check WILL NOT be re-deposited a second time.
- If the patient has a check returned, they will be required to pay by cash or credit card ONLY for future appointments.

# 6. SHOPPERS:

- To avoid confusion and us being held to a certain fee, we will not quote exact fees over the phone to patients, we will quote a WIDE fee range (ex: an x-ray could cost between $22 and $139).
---
# 7. PAST DUE ACCOUNTS:

- All accounts with an outstanding balance will be contacted will receive a statement at 30 days past due, a phone call at 45 days past due, a statement at 60 days past due, a phone call at 75 days.
- At 90 days past due the patient will incur a second billing fee and a FINAL Notice.
- If payment in full is not received by day 100, the account will be forwarded to a collection agency.
- Patients will be responsible for all fees incurred by a collection agency.

# 8. DIVORCE SITUATIONS:

- The parent/guardian who brings the child in for their appointment will be responsible for any necessary payment associated with that appointment. We will gladly give a receipt to the parent/guardian, so they may seek reimbursement from the other parent.
- A credit card may be kept on file for services rendered.
- In some rare instances, we may need to ask for a copy of the divorce decree explaining who is responsible for payment.

# 9. COURTESY ADJUSTMENTS:

- At the discretion of Dr. Green, a courtesy adjustment of 15% may be given to other doctors and/or their staff members. This courtesy will only apply if they do not have dental insurance.
- At the discretion of Dr. Green, family members, friends and clergy may be given a 20% courtesy adjustment. This courtesy will only apply if they do not have dental insurance.

# 10. DENTAL BENEFIT PLAN:

- For patients who DO NOT have dental insurance coverage.
- This is an in-house membership/savings plan for patients. This IS NOT an insurance plan!
- This plan can ONLY be used at Green Dental Care.
- The Dental Benefit Plan CANNOT be combined with any other offers within the practice and CANNOT be used in conjunction with dental insurance.

IMPORTANT!!!! If a courtesy adjustment is offered to a patient, regardless of the reason, and the patient is insured, the courtesy must be extended to the insurance company as well.

For example, if the patient’s treatment is $1,000 and you extend a 5% or $50 pay in full courtesy, a note MUST be made in the narrative section of the claim form. If you do not follow this practice, you will be committing insurance fraud.

# OON Insurance/Medicaid/HMO Opt Out Private Contract

This contract is between Dr. Christopher Green, DMD, and _____________________________ (patient). This allows the dentist to provide treatment to the patient without being subject to Medicare, Medicaid or HMO limits.

By signing this contract, Patient does the following:

1. Agrees to not submit a Medicare, Medicaid or HMO claim (or to request that the dentist submit a claim) for services or items supplied by the dentist, even if they are otherwise covered under Medicaid or HMO.
---
# 2.

Agrees to be responsible, whether through insurance or otherwise, for payment of services or items supplied by the dentist, and understands that no reimbursement will be provided under Medicaid or HMO for those services or items. Patients will pay for such services at the dentist’s usual rate in accordance with dentist’s payment policies. The total for services or items will be paid in full (out of pocket).

# 3.

Acknowledges that Medicaid or HMO limits do not apply to amounts that a dentist may charge for such services or items.

# 4.

Acknowledges that supplemental insurance plans may elect not to make payments for items and services covered in this contract, because payment is not made under Medicaid or HMO.

# 5.

Acknowledges that patient has the right to have such services or items provided by other dentists or practitioners for whom payment would be made under Medicaid or HMO. (Patients are not required to enter into private contracts that apply to other Medicare, Medicaid or HMO covered services furnished by other dentists who have not opted out).

# ENTERING INSURANCE IN OPEN DENTAL: A to Z

First double check - is the patient or a spouse/parent the subscriber on the plan? If another person is the subscriber, make sure that person is added in Open Dental, included under same family, and set as “Guarantor”

# Adding a Subscriber in Open Dental

- If the family member is not already in the system…
- Under “Family” tab, click the “+ Add” Button next to “Family members”
- Enter the Subscriber's Name, gender, status (Patient or NonPatient), and if you are using their SSN as the insurance ID, add that as well. Click OK
- With subscriber’s name highlighted, click “Set Guarantor”

# Adding Insurance Plan to Patient’s Chart

- Go to “Family” tab on patient’s account
- Click the “Add Insurance” button (Yellow Umbrella icon)

239
---
# Insurance Plan Information

● Is patient the subscriber? (Yes or No)

- If no, select Subscriber’s name from the list of family members. If the subscriber already has a plan attached to their account, this will come up as an option to select.

● Before attempting to manually add the plan from scratch, click the “Pick From List” button to see if we have any other patients under the same insurance plan

- Use the Carrier / Group Name / Group Number options to search.
- If there is an exact match, highlight the plan and click “OK” to add that plan to the patient’s account.
- Once you have added the plan, set the relationship to subscriber (if it is not “self”), and then click out of the plan again. You cannot make any changes to an existing plan without exiting and reopening the Plan info.

# Plan Info Tab

- ● Enter the Employer, Carrier (Insurance Company), Claims Address, Phone Number, etc.
- ● Add the electronic ID. This allows claims to be submitted electronically through dental exchange. This information can often be found on the benefits breakdown, or you can search it through open dental.
- ● Enter the subscriber's group name and number
- ○ Be sure to include the entire group number, as some employers will have just one or two digits differ between plans.
- ● Select Correct “Plan type”
- ○ PPO Percentage: for PPO plans that are in network, or out of network plans for which we will honor a fee schedule other than office fees. Never use PPO percentage with “Office fees” as the corresponding fee schedule.
- ○ Category Percentage: ONLY TO BE USED for out of network plans being billed on OFFICE FEES. For fee schedules other than Office fees, never use Category Percentage!
- ● Select the CORRECT FEE SCHEDULE: (See Scheduling Patients Based on Insurance for more info/to ensure you select the correct fee schedules)
1. Office fees- select office fees when the patient’s insurance is out of network and reimbursement will follow “UCR” or “Office Fees”.
2. BCBS P300- Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield or Anthem Blue Cross plans that are listed as “PPO 300” plans, “Complete” or “Grid Plus” plans also fall under this fee schedule. We are not in network with PPO 200 or 100 plans, or plans that are listed as “Prime” or “Grid” plans.
---
1. For Fed VIP plans be sure to enter the R# (medical plan) or F# (dental plan) for the subscriber ID. They will not accept the SS# for insurance claims.
2. Careington - Umbrella network to use for: Cigna, GEHA, Beam, Guardian, United Healthcare, Metlife (PDP+ and FEDVIP networks only), Lincoln Financial.
3. Zelis - Umbrella network to use for Principal and Ameritas.
4. DHA (Dental Health Alliance) - Umbrella network to use for United Concordia (non Tricare), Sunlife, Assurant, and Mutual of Omaha.
5. Delta PREMIER - Use this fee schedule for all Delta Dental plans. Some patients’ plans may have lesser or no coverage under Premier. (Example: We cannot see EPO plans, PPO only, Pediatric plans). Also, Some plans may only pay off PPO Fees rather than Premier Fees, and difference will be patient responsibility.
6. United Concordia DOD plans - United Concordia plans that are for active duty military members and their dependents. These plans include “TriCare” and ‘ADDP” or “TDP” plans.

# Other Ins Info Tab

# Substitution of Codes (i.e. Crowns and Posterior Composites)

Does the insurance plan downgrade posterior composites? Crowns? On all teeth? Just molars? Just posterior teeth?

- If the plan does not downgrade for both crowns AND posterior composites, check the box for “Don’t Substitute Codes (e.g. posterior composites).
- If the plan downgrades only crowns, or only posterior composites, or only for certain teeth, click the box for “Subst Codes” to designate accordingly.
- For each specific code, click the box under the “SubstOnlyIf” column to the correct option: Always, Molar, SecondMolar, Never, Posterior.
---
The far left column shows the code we bill (i.e. D2391), the 4th column designates the alternate code insurance will pay upon (i.e. amalgam, D2140). The alternate code will default to the most common alternate code, so it does not need to be changed unless an insurance rep tells you a different code.

- If a plan always downgrades both crowns AND posterior composites on ALL teeth, you do not need to change anything from default settings (but I would still click the “Subst Codes” box just to ensure that all fields read as “Always”)

# Coordination of Benefits

If the plan’s Coordination of Benefits is Standard or “Birthday Rule”, this will default accordingly. But if the COB is “NON-DUPLICATING”, this should be specified by changing “COB Rule” to “CarveOut”. Note that this will only be a factor if a patient has dual insurance.

Under Subscriber Information (righthand gray column):

242
---
- Enter subscriber ID (which may be the subscriber’s SSN)
- Effective dates
- Enter the initial date of coverage - this may be from several years ago. Not to be mistaken for the dates of the current “benefit period”. DO NOT put a date in the “to” field unless you know coverage is set to terminate at the end of the current month etc
- Note Section
- These are the details regarding benefits/eligibility that are specific ONLY to this particular subscriber and their family
- There is a template you can copy and paste into the notes area:
AS OF [DATE] (per call w/ REP, REF#):

[YES / NO] Adult Ortho Coverage

[PT NAME] IS ELIG FOR FMX/PANO, BW, EXAM, PROPHY. [YES / NO] HX OF PERIO ON FILE [your initials]
- Use the above template to ensure you don’t miss checking on any basic eligibility for services that we always like to check on up front
- Is the patient eligible for an FMX/PANO? -- these 2 services generally share a frequency
- Is the patient eligible for Bitewings (BW)?
- Is the patient eligible for an exam?
- Is the patient eligible for a cleaning?
- You also want to check if the patient has a history of SRP or PerioMaintenance, and get any dates of prior treatment
---
● If a patient is not currently eligible for services such as FMX/PANO, be sure to note that along with what date they WILL be eligible. Type it into subscriber notes but also adjust the date by double clicking in the “Recall” section and selecting or adding a line for the particular service, along with the “actual due date”

● If a patient has a history of SRP/Perio on file, we also want to update this in the “Recall” section by clicking the box for “Set Perio”

● If the patient has a history of SRP or PerioMaintenance and you have the exact dates, you can also add these by double clicking in the “history” section
---
# Adjustments to Insurance benefits

(Top R hand corner in Green)

- If the patient is not the subscriber, be sure to indicate relationship to subscriber (i.e. Spouse, Child, Dependent) from the dropdown in the upper green section.
- Be sure that every time you verify/update eligibility for a SPECIFIC PATIENT, you update the “AS OF ___” line, as well as click the “NOW” button for “Eligibility last verified”.
- Use this section to enter information relating to benefit amounts that have already been used. For example, if the patient has met their deductible for the year, enter it here. Enter any amount toward the maximum they have already used for the year.
- Note- we only enter this if benefits were used outside our office. E.g. the patient is new and we are verifying them for the first time. Patient goes to periodontist or other speciality providers throughout the year- update this information.
- Click the “Add” button on the far right and type in $ amount used toward annual max (insurance used) and the amount met toward the deductible (deductible used). Then click “OK”. This will update the patient’s benefits available when treatment planning.

# Under Benefit Information Section:

- Double click to open and enter plan specifics/breakdowns/ frequencies/ limitations
---
# Benefit Year

If the plan runs on a calendar benefit year, leave the box checked under “calendar” (this is the default), but if a benefit period begins at another time, i.e. July 1st, uncheck the calendar box, and type the specific month number in the “Month” section (i.e. “7” for July).

# Enter Annual Max and Deductible

Annual Max should be typed under the “Individual” box. Include the Deductible amounts for BOTH an individual and family. There is typically no “family maximum”, so leave that section blank, rather than a 0. Likewise, if a plan has NO annual maximum, leave the box blank rather than 0. However, if there is no deductible, type in “0”.

# Deductible Application

Most plans do not have the deductible apply to diagnostic & preventive services. This will auto populate to 0.00. You ONLY need to change this if the deductible DOES apply to xrays (for instance, if a plan is out of network, the deductible may count toward all services, or just for xrays etc.).

# Category % Column

The Category % column is to note the percent that INSURANCE will pay toward services. Note that some benefit breakdowns will list the patient percentage, so always double check what you are entering. Open Dental will default to D&P 100% / Basic 80% / Major 50%, but this may need to be changed. You can use the “Quick %” sections if all categories in a section are the same, however some plans may consider Endo/Perio/Oral Surgery under Major rather than Basic.
---
- If a plan has “Waiting Periods” for certain services, be sure to note these next to the category as well. (This is why entering the PLAN EFFECTIVE date is so important, so we can tell if waiting periods have been met. (Also write “waiting periods satisfied” in patient notes section)
- The Fluoride and Sealants “Through Age” should be the oldest a patient can be with coverage. If a breakdown states FL is covered for patients UNDER 18, you would put “17” as the through age.
- Ortho Benefits may include a dependent age limit (i.e. age 19), but also include “adult” coverage for the subscriber and spouse. In this case, type 19 as the age limit, and in the subscriber notes, this is where you put “YES” for Adult Ortho.
- Frequencies should be entered for services as either “every __ years”, “___ per benefit year”, “every __ months”, or “__ in the last 12 months”. The main benefit section view only shows the frequency for BWs, Pano/FMX, and Exams. Click the “More” button to open up frequencies for prophy, SRP, crowns, etc.
- Be sure to carefully read the benefit breakdown regarding frequencies for exams and cleanings etc. Does it say “2 in a calendar year” vs “2 per 12 months” vs “1 in 6 months? The first implies that 2 cleanings are allowed to be done at any time per calendar year (may also say “benefit period”). The second would allow 2 within the last rolling 12 months, regardless of whether they fall within different calendar years/benefit periods. The third stipulates that cleanings must be spaced at least 6 months apart to the day. (I.e. If a cleaning is done on January 3rd, the next cleaning should be no sooner than June 4th)
---
● Double click on a line in the “Other Benefits” box to adjust the benefits on an auto populated line. Or, click “Add” to enter procedure codes that are not auto populated e.g. buildup, implant crown, occlusal guards, etc

● To adjust/specify the details of a code, note the following:

- If you are using a specific procedure code, the category must be “none”
- “Type” often defaults to “Limitations”, but if you enter a Coinsurance %, you’ll need to change it to “CoInsurance”
- Percent = Coinsurance %
- Amount = A dollar amount, such as for a $ maximum allowed, or a deductible
- Time period = often will be “none”, unless you are specifying a number of services per time period. (i.e. Full Mouth Debridement is often “1 number of services PER Lifetime”)
- Quantity and Qualifier are typically the frequency section you’ll use
- Coverage Level may be left as the default of “none”, or if you are specifying for a deductible/maximum amount, make this “individual”

● For more instruction on entering services not subject to the annual deductible or maximum, see THIS instructional document

It is important to clearly type up a brief breakdown of benefits for quick reference/clarification at a glance.

Copy and Paste the following TEMPLATE into the section, (This ensures that no important information is missed, and consistency in how information is laid out)

# Insurance Half-Sheet (3 month Update) Protocol

If a patient comes in for an appointment and it has been more than 3 months we will verify their current eligibility if they still have the same plan. We will fill out an Insurance Half-Sheet for them:

- BUT FIRST -- Look in Open Dental and make sure that the patient’s insurance plan has a FULL benefit breakdown entered. There should be a detailed description in the Plan Details section which will look something like this:
- If the plan does not have the full details, OR if the plan was verified by “LH”, the plan needs a full verification rather than just the 3 month update.
- See Full Verification Form:

If the patient’s plan is fully verified/entered, proceed with the 3 month update protocol:

- See Half-Sheet Form:
- Look up patient’s eligibility online or call insurance company
- Effective dates (current benefit year)
- Verify if the plan is on a calendar year, or if it’s based on a fiscal year/other benefit year
- Under Benefit Information on plan details in Open Dental, either check the box for calendar year, or change to specific month if necessary
- Group # & Group Name
- Enter the FULL group name & number, rather than just an part of the #, as some employers will offer multiple options to choose from
- Benefit Details
- You may also want to glance at or ask if any of the plan benefits have changed recently -- or if you notice any important details missing (ortho coverage,
---
# occlusal guard benefits, downgrades on posterior composites or crowns etc), ask about and update that info

- Plan Benefit details that are not specific to the patient/subscriber should be entered under “PLAN NOTE” rather than “Subscriber Note”, so that it will be reflected accurately in the benefit details for all subscribers on the same group #

# Check individual patient’s current status:

- Eligibility for Exam (PerEx / LimEx)
- Eligibility for Prophy / PerioMaint / SRP
- Eligibility for FMX/Pano
- Eligibility for BW
- Deductible amount met
- If the patient was treated by another Dental Provider during the benefit year, this may be different than what is shown in Open Dental. In that case, be sure to update by clicking the “add” button by “Adjustments to Insurance Benefits” in the upper right corner
- Maximum used to date
- If the patient was treated by another Dental Provider during the benefit year, this may be different than what is shown in Open Dental. In that case, be sure to update by clicking the “add” button by “Adjustments to Insurance Benefits” in the upper right corner. This may affect treatment plan accuracy
- These details should be noted in “Subscriber Note” rather than “Plan Note”. Recall dates for specific services can also be updated if necessary.

After all changes have been made, scan the half-sheet and upload to the patient's chart in Open Dental.

# Protocol for Verifying Returning Patients’ Insurance

- Hygienists will ask patients if insurance has changed during 1 week confirmation calls, and will make note/let front office know if patient has new insurance
- Director of Operations (Lindsey) and Insurance Verification Team (April) will handle the majority of the half-sheet verifications. Goal is to remain at least 1 week ahead with these verifications.
- Short notice/same day verifications will be handled by Lindsey and/or Karen.
- Status for verification will be noted in the top line of appointment notes.
- I.e. “INSURANCE RE-VERIFIED [DATE, INITIALS]”, “NEED NEW INS INFO”, etc

# Last Minute Insurance Verification Protocol

We as a team don’t want last minute insurance verification to be a stresser for any member of the team. Therefore, we are putting a protocol together in order to eliminate the stress points that come along with last minute insurance verification. We need to do our best to obtain insurance information from our patients even if it is at the last minute, in order to provide them the best experience possible.

1. The entire front office team will do their best to verify insurance prior to a patient's appointment however there are scenarios where the patient does not provide us insurance information until they arrive at the office.
2. Once we receive the patient's insurance information, scan it into the patient chart. Provide insurance information received to either Emily, Lindsey, Karen or Kelsey to obtain eligibility and fill out a quick verification form.
3. Advise the patient that “we will do our best to obtain as much accurate information as possible prior to completing any services.
1. If we are unable to verify the insurance we will charge any New Patients $200 for the New Patient special if it is a hygiene appointment, or full fee for any restorative work, crediting back any over payment after insurance has been verified, and insurance payment has been received.
4. Complete Quick Insurance Verification attached. Quick Insurance Verification Form
5. If full breakdown is not able to be completed prior to patients departure please have them sign “Small Balance Authorization Form” attached Small Balance Authorization Form. Using the following verbiage:
---
(Patient Name). We did our best to get an accurate insurance break down but because it was last minute there is always a chance that insurance could have some quirky rules. So we'll go ahead and get a credit card authorization for anything under $100. Anything over $100 we will call you to set up a payment arrangement.

# 6. Email April to complete full breakdown for last minute patients.

Tips for finding patients insurance if they don’t have all of the details:

- Insurance companies can do national searches if we are unable to obtain the specific state.
- Ask where the subscriber's employer is located and that can help narrow down the state specifics or google the name of the company to find the state location of the main office.
- Ask if they used this same insurance at their previous dentist, call the previous dentist office and see if they can assist in providing us more details such as state or ID #.

# Narrative Cheats for Insurance Claims

***CHECK CHART NOTES TO SEE IF ADDITIONAL HELPFUL INFORMATION/NARRATIVE IS THERE!!!***

# D4341 / D4342 - SRP:

Copy & Paste SRP notes from patient’s chart. Begin with “PERIODONTAL DIAGNOSIS” and copy everything up until “ORAL HYGIENE INSTRUCTION/HOME CARE”

ALSO INCLUDE PERIO CHART AND XRAYS (MUST BE BW/PA/FMX - NOT PANO)

# D2950 - Core Build Up & D2740 Crown (EXISTING FILLING/recurrent decay):

Patient presented with large existing filling on tooth #__ and recurrent decay present. Once existing restoration and decay were removed, over half the tooth (50%+) was missing, leaving insufficient structure to support revised fillings or a crown on its own. Core buildup was placed for retention of the crown.

# D2950 - Core Build Up & D2740 Crown (BROKEN TOOTH):

Patient presented with broken tooth #__. Weak tooth and over 50% of the tooth is missing. The remaining structure was insufficient to support fillings or a crown on its own. Core buildup was placed for retention of the crown.

# D2740 - Crown placed over previous filling (NO BUILDUP NEEDED):

Patient presents with a large filling extending more than ⅔ up the buccal and lingual cusps. Recurrent decay present extending over halfway into the dentin. Once recurrent decay was removed, over 50% of the tooth was missing, and the remaining tooth structure cannot support additional/revised fillings, so a crown is warranted to preserve the tooth.

# D2740 - REPLACEMENT OF OLD/BROKEN/MISSING CROWN w/ BUILDUP D2950

253
---
Patient presents with substantial recurrent decay on the distal and lingual aspects of the existing crown on tooth #__ (date of initial crown placement: _____). After removal of crown and existing restorative material and recurrent decay, over 50% of the tooth was missing, and insufficient tooth structure remained to support and maintain the crown, so a core buildup was placed. The old crown was deemed unusable and no longer fit, so a new crown was fabricated. Please see intra oral photos, which may more clearly show the need for treatment than x-rays alone.

# D2740 - REPLACEMENT OF OLD CROWN, NO BUILDUP NEEDED

Patient presents with substantial recurrent decay on the distal and lingual aspects of the existing crown on tooth #__ (date of initial crown placement: _____). After removal of the crown and existing restorative material and recurrent decay, the old crown no longer fit and was deemed unusable, so a new crown was fabricated. Please see intra oral photos and xrays.

# ADD TO BU OR CROWN NARRATIVE WHEN PT HAS CRACKED TOOTH SYNDROME

# FLEX BILLING Protocol: How to send an Invoice/Statement

As always, use your best judgment before sending an electronic statement to someone who may not even have a cell phone or email address they use frequently. The alternative option is to send a paper statement via snail mail.

# Determining if patient has a balance to be paid:

- A patient’s EOB/ Insurance payment is received for a claim and the payment is entered. The account should ideally be evaluated for a balance the SAME DAY, and the statement should be sent as soon as possible, if appropriate.
- Assess-
---
# 1. Have all claims been paid for this patient’s account?

# 2. Are there any outstanding insurance issues or claims that require resolution?

# 3. If the account has other family members, do other members have outstanding credits or balances to be evaluated?

- If a patient (and/or family) have a true balance to the account - a statement needs to be sent via FLEX. The patient will receive a request for payment via text/email as soon as the statement is created.
- If the patient has a LARGE account balance (usually $200 or more), call the patient first so they are not blindsided by receiving a large bill from our office.

# In FLEX: Creating an Invoice

- Login to FLEX > Should be directed to the “Home” page
- Search for the patient
- (Flex does not combine balances between family members, so be sure to select the actual family member with a balance - statements will be sent to/addresses to the parent/guarantor for children. If more than one family member has a balance, you’ll need to send separate statements for each of them)
- Click the $ symbol to Send Statement
- An itemized list of all visits/charges will come up for the patient
- If previous statements for a specific service have been sent, you’ll see the last sent date.
---
●  If needed, you have the option to click the upper right icon to “Filter to Balance Only”
●  Select the desired/appropriate line items.
                                     261
---
The amount due will be calculated at the bottom of the screen. If that amount matches the total balance due in the patient’s Open Dental account, you’re ready to send.

NOTE: You can only send a statement through Flex if the patient has an outstanding balance. If you are simply trying to send the patient an itemized receipt/statement, you’ll need to do so via Open Dental.

Select the icon at the bottom of the screen for how you’d like to send the bill (Email/Text)

- I usually send the email statement first, and if it seems appropriate (patient’s age, time of day, etc) I then follow up by sending the statement via text.

You’ll get a screen previewing the message that will be sent to the patient.

If sending via TEXT, you can use the following message:

Hi [Patient],

After insurance has paid for your last visit, a balance remains to be paid. You can click the following link to access your forms and make payment. Please contact our office if you have any questions.

Kind Regards,
Green Dental Care

If sending via EMAIL, you’ll want to update the message to be a bit more informative, as follows:

# Patient Refund Check Protocol

- Identify that there is a TRUE credit on the account. How to tell if this is the case:
- All pending insurance claims have been paid/settled (“InsEst” should be 0)
- Patient Balance (“Est Bal”) is a negative amount
- There should be a pop-up or commlog note stating that this is a true credit
- First check to see if the patient or any family members have pending treatment (either scheduled on or their treatment plans) that the credit can be used toward
- If you have a conversation with a patient either over the phone or in person and they inquire about receiving a refund check
- Tell the patient “Great, I will let our financial coordinator know and she can look into getting you that refund check! She only issues these checks on a few specific days in the month so it may not be processed for a few weeks. Would you like to have that mailed to you, or would you like to pick it up at your upcoming appointment (if applicable)? Great, can I please verify that we have your correct address on file?”
- Log the patient’s name on the “Patient Credit/Refund Check Requests” Google Spreadsheet. Include Pt name, date you spoke to pt and your initials, note that they want a refund check, and add notes regarding the conversation w/ the patient. Please be sure to note if you confirmed the pt’s address.
- ADD A COMM LOG NOTE in Open Dental regarding your conversation with the patient

# Issuing Checks (On the 5th & the 20th of the Month)

- Office Manager & Financial Coordinator will review patient refund spreadsheet.
- Write a check for the appropriate amount, and log in the black “checkbook”
---
- Have Dr. Green approve & sign the check
- Scan a copy of the check into pts images
- Upload scan, and file under the “Financial Agreement” section
- Label as “Pt Refund Check # ____”
- Add/Log refund check in patients Account Module
- “Add Payment”
- *You will put this in as a NEGATIVE PMT
- Make a CommLog note that check was mailed:
- EXAMPLE: Verified address on file was correct and mailed refund check #1160 in the amount of $122.24 to pt. Eh
- {MAILED PT REFUND CHECK #_ IN THE AMOUNT OF $_ TO PT} kr
- Print a “Walkout” Statement to show that patient has a 0.00 balance on account, and put in the envelope along with a check.
- Then mail check :)

# HOW TO SET A DENTAL PROCEDURE CODE TO ALWAYS POPULATE TO 0% COVERAGE IN OPEN DENTAL

1. Click “Setup” on top toolbar in Open Dental
2. Select “Family/Insurance >”
3. Select “Insurance Categories”
4. Select the “Usually NOT COVERED” category
5. Click the “ + Add Span” Button
6. Add the desired code to both the To and From boxes on the code range
1. Adjust the code ranges for other service categories to remove that one code as needed
1. Example: when adding Pulp Cap (D3110) to this category, the Endo category spans had to be changed to D3000 to D3109 and D3111 to D3999

# HOW TO CHANGE RECALL AUTO-POPULATING CODES IN OPEN DENTAL

1. Click “Setup” on top toolbar in Open Dental
2. Select “Appointments >”
3. Select “Recall Types”
4. Double click on any type of recall and adjust the codes if needed
1. Highlight the necessary code in the “Procedures on Appointment” Box, and click “Remove”. Click “Add” to include a new/different code
1. Example: The fluoride code attached to child prophy appointments was D1208, so that was removed, and D1206 was added.
5. If a change has been made, you’ll be prompted to “Synchronize all recall appointments”

# Dual Insurance Coverage

# Coordination of Benefits (COB) Types

- “Standard” or “Traditional”
- Allows the beneficiary to receive up to 100% of expenses from a combination of the primary and secondary plans
- “Maintenance of Benefits”
---
# Reduces covered charges by the amount the primary plan has paid, and then applies the plan deductible and co-insurance criteria. The plan therefore pays less than it would under traditional COB and the beneficiary is typically left with some cost sharing

# “Carve Out”

First calculates the normal plan benefits that would be paid, then reduces this amount by the amount paid by the primary plan

# “Non-Duplicating”

If the primary plan paid the same or more than what the secondary carrier would have paid if it had been primary, then the secondary carrier is not responsible for any payment at all.

“No-Dual” non duplicating. If Delta Dental Plan is secondary and the primary is also Delta Dental then the secondary will not pay anything

# Determining Primary vs. Secondary Plan

# IN NETWORK vs. OUT OF NETWORK

IN NETWORK TRUMPS OUT OF NETWORK. If what would normally be the primary plan is out of network, but you are contracted with the secondary plan, then secondary should be used as primary!

# COB PROVISION vs. STANDARD

STANDARD COB TRUMPS OTHER PROVISIONS. The plan WITHOUT any COB Provisions (aka “standard” coordination) will be primary to a plan WITH a COB Provision (ex. Nonduplicating)

# Subscriber vs. Spouse/Dependent

The plan in which the patient is the subscriber is Primary. The plan in which the patient is a spouse/dependent is secondary

- A husband and wife who are both covered under their own and each other’s plans will have opposite primary/secondary benefits

# “Birthday Rule” - for Dependent Children

If a dependent has coverage under both parents, the subscriber whose birthday falls earliest in the calendar year (not who is older) will be considered primary

- If Mom’s birthday is in September and Dad’s is in June, then Dad’s plan is considered the primary and Mom’s plan is secondary

BIRTHDAY RULE ONLY APPLIES TO MARRIED COUPLES! If the parents are divorced, then court order/custody determines primary coverage

# More than One Employer/Self Plan (same Subscriber)

If a patient has two plans for which they are the subscriber, whichever employer has covered the subscriber longest will be considered primary (a change in dental plan/carrier does not change the length of coverage time)

# Current Employment

A retiree or COBRA plan will be considered secondary to any other coverage that is offered by a current employer

# Federal vs. Tricare

If a patient has a FEDVIP and a Tricare plan, federal (FEDVIP) will be considered primary over military (Tricare) coverage.

# Medical plans with dental coverage

Medical plan is considered primary to dental

- Some medical plans have limited dental coverage and will always have to be billed as primary
---
These are often FEDVIP plans with BCBS or GEHA.

Sometimes a medical plan includes coverage for wisdom teeth or accidents. For those specific services only, claims will first be sent to the medical plan.

# Dental Savings Plan Production Allocation

This is very much specific to our office. We no longer offer hygiene bonuses but we do pay dentists on production while applying the entire Dental Savings Plan membership fee to the practice, therefore, we do have to manually allocate some production to each dentist for their exam. Since this is not UCR fees we allocate a much lower dollar amount for the exam production on a Dental Savings Plan because those exams are a great opportunity to discover dental treatment.

- Dental Savings Plan production allocation will be based on the discounted rate for a family of 4. DSP patients are cash patients that allow us to get reimbursed at a much higher rate than insurance patients, so take good care of them and make them long term loyal patrons of our practice.
- Most procedures and adjustments for DSP members are a straight 15% discount and very straight forward for calculating your production accurately, this document is intended for allocating production for services provided that are included in the $365/yr membership fee.
- Exams, Regular Cleanings (including up to 2 perio maintenance), X-rays and Fluoride are included in the plan and therefore not a straight 15% adjustment.
- There is no easy way to split this up, we believe this is more than fair, the difference in production and DSP fee goes toward management of the plan and marketing expenses to acquire more NP to the practice.

# Dentist Production

- No production for Limited Exams, Emergency Exams, Additional X-rays needed at emergency appointments (or other complimentary / included DSP services as per the DSP brochure).

# Current Promotions

- $500 OFF invisalign
- $4,000 Implant start to finish
- When a patient comes in for Initial Comp Exam or Periodic Exams (2 per year per patient) you will ADD $35 towards your production for that day and have signed off by Office Manager

# Hygienist Production

- For each recall you ADD $100 to your end of day production report and have signed by Office Manager, whether or not you took X-rays that day. This is based on the law of averages, sometimes you will take an FMX, sometimes no x-rays, sometimes just bite wings...we will base your production at $100 for every DSP member recall.
- Remember DSP covers 2 cleanings per year so the production above is for the 2 times per year that the patient has an exam with a dentist.
- For example if you have a perio maintenance patient that comes 4 times per year, 2 of their cleanings are covered with DSP and the other 2 they will pay 15% off of our UCR fee for Perio Maintenance which will go towards your production normally.

# $200 NP Special

- Allocate $52 to Doctor Production and $144 to Hygiene production

# Sock It Gel for Extractions

One way to better serve our patient is to help with post operative pain after extractions.

Jordyn: “Along with the extraction, we have used this gel to help avoid painful dry sockets for our patients. The gels speed up the healing process so we can get you up and running as soon as possible. It’s part of the extraction and has seen a lot less post op pain.”

Code: “Sockitgel”

Implement for every extraction

$40 per extraction

$80 per wisdom tooth case (4 teeth)
