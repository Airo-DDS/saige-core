Policy Overview:  
- All appointments are scheduled through our central system with accurate patient contact details.

- For new patients, collect insurance details (if applicable) and personal information at booking.  

Key Points / Guidelines:  
- Verify accurate contact information each time.  
- Offer multiple communication methods (phone, text, email) for reminders.

Common Staff Questions:  
- “Do I need to double-check insurance for every new patient?” → Yes, always verify coverage.  
- “When should reminders be sent?” → At least 48 hours in advance.  

Additional Notes:

Policy Name: Cancellation & No-Show Policy  
Common Terms / Synonyms: “Cancellation fee,” “Late cancellation,” “No-show charge,” “24-hour notice”  
Policy Overview:  
- A minimum of 24 hours’ notice is required to cancel or reschedule most appointments.  
- Same-day cancellations or no-shows may incur a fee.  
- Repeated no-shows can lead to dismissal from the practice at management’s discretion.  

Key Points / Guidelines:  
- Communicate policy at the time of booking and in reminder calls/texts.  
- Track and document all missed appointments; escalate after 2 consecutive no-shows.  
- Waiving or adjusting fees requires management approval.  

Common Patient Questions / Concerns:  
- “I had an emergency—can I avoid the fee?” → Management or lead staff may waive once if it’s a true emergency.  
- “No one told me about this policy!” → Reference the booking confirmation or patient welcome packet.  

Additional Notes:

- Chronic lateness can result in rescheduling or partial treatment if time is limited.  

Key Points / Guidelines:  
- Front desk should inform patients upon arrival if the schedule can accommodate them.  
- If another patient is waiting, the on-time patient has priority.  
- Document habitual lateness in patient notes.  

Common Patient Questions / Concerns:  
- “I’m five minutes late—can I still be seen?” → Usually yes, but clarify any shortened service or wait time.  
- “Why can’t I be treated when I arrive?” → Explain that the schedule is tight and respects all patients.  

Additional Notes:

Common Patient Questions / Concerns:
