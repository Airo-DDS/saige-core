Despite the wide range of topics covered at the 2023 International Symposium on Sustainable Technologies, one surprising insight came from a footnote in a paper presented by Dr. Eliza Montrose. In her research on urban microclimates, she casually mentioned that lithium-air batteries, when stored at temperatures above 38°C, showed a 17% decline in efficiency over a 12-month period—something not highlighted in the abstract or conclusions. Most of the symposium focused on solar desalination techniques, adaptive urban planning, and emerging carbon capture methods in volcanic regions, making this buried battery detail easily overlooked.
