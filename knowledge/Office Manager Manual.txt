# How to Use this Manual

If you’ve purchased this, then you already believe that there are some things in your dental practice that you can improve. You might know that you should do something to systemize your business, but just don’t know how to do that. Good news- this book holds the keys and examples to everything you want to do in your practice!

Over the past few years, we’ve seen practices that are disorganized and chaotic. Instruments are not ever put on the tray the same way twice. Or some employees do things ‘this way’, and other employees do it ‘my way’. Good news- It doesn’t have to be this way! This book is a guide-post for what you should have in your office to help the team understand your expectations of them, as well as examples for what you should have to help run your dental practice with better systemization. If you can copy just half of these systems and replicate them to your own practice, then you will be way ahead of most other practices.

These documents and systems are not new ideas. They are ideas started by visionaries, shared, improved, and passed on. Our job is to continue the practice of passing them on so that they can continue to improve dentists’ practices and make your business less stressful and chaotic. It is with great thanks that we recognize dental rock-stars like Dr. Summer Kassmel, Dr. Jason Tanoory, and many other ‘Black-Belt’ coaches we work with. This manual also would not be possible without our assistant Nicole- an amazing assistant who is the real all-star of the project.

If this example manual speaks to you and this is the sort of thing that gets you excited, then you might really enjoy the private dentist-only community that we’ve created at the Dental Success Network. As part of membership, we have many other documents and spreadsheets shared inside DSN that come with membership.

If you ever have questions about this manual or want to see something in future versions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Addison via www.AddisonKilleen.com or Chris at www.DynamicDentalAscension.com. We would love to hear your thoughts and help you implement any way we can.

Our driving force is to help dentists improve their situations, so if you have enjoyed this manual, it would be amazing if you shared it with a friend.

To your Success,

Addison Killeen DDS                  Chris Green DMD

# Systemization Scorecard

When we work with dentists, we always start with a self-evaluation. As we start this journey of systemization with you, we would like you to complete it as well. Below is a complete checklist to help you see where you might need to improve. In each section, there are also sub-set checklists to focus on the strategies in that section. Go through this checklist to see how you measure up. Watch introduction video →

# Foundation

- We have defined the Mission Statement for our practice.
- We have defined the Vision Statement for our practice.
- We have defined our Core Values for our practice.
- We have posted these foundational principles in a prominent place as well as in the Operations Manual.
- We have made it an accountability for each team member to commit the foundational principles to memory.
- We ensure that each team member has committed to living and working by these principles while in the practice.
- We regularly review the foundational principles to keep them relevant and modify them when they cease to inspire and motivate the team.

# Operational Systemization

- We have created protocol sheets for everyday tasks performed by each team member (with the input of each team member).
- We have created Accountability Agreements for each position which includes: all tasks from each protocol sheet, all tasks that are shared among the team, the practice’s Core Values, and signatures of each team member, CEO and/or direct supervisor and office manager.
- We have taken photos of each of the following: Ideal tray setups, materials and equipment setups per procedure, common areas, supply, lab, sterilization, and business offices.
- We have an organizational chart including all team positions. (Note: team members may hold more than one position).
- We have team performance review forms that are completed and filed in employee personnel files after each review.
- We have agendas for the following meetings: Morning Huddle, Weekly Growth Meetings, Weekly Departmental Lead Meetings, & Quarterly Calibration Meetings.
- We have a complete Operations Manual with the following contents: Foundational Principles, Accountability Agreements, Organizational Chart, Agendas and Scripts for the Patient Experience.
---
# Lifetime Patient Experience

We have a telephone script and protocol in place for all categories of incoming calls.

We have a script for all appointment confirmation calls.

We have a script and protocol for all patients entering the doors of the practice (front office).

We have a script and protocol for transitioning the patient from the waiting room to the treatment room.

We have a script and protocol for seating a patient.

We have a script and protocol for introduction/transition to doctor.

We have a script and protocol for treatment planning/case presentation.

We have a script and protocol for transition to front office (check-out).

We have a script and protocol for checking out and reappointing each patient.

# New Patient Acquisition

We have a written system for obtaining patient referrals in place.

We hold certain team members accountable for maintaining a referral generation system.

We have a system for gathering doctor/patient photos, testimonials, and online reviews.

We hold the team accountable for a certain minimum number of photos, testimonials, and online reviews per week.

We have a system in place for locating and sponsoring a community outreach recipient every month.

We have a system for tracking the sources of each new patient and verifying its accuracy with the practice management software.

We have identified our monthly marketing budget and can calculate the ROI on each campaign that we run.

We utilize tracking telephone numbers on all marketing campaigns whenever possible.

We do not sign long term contracts for any external marketing source unless its effectiveness has been tested and tracked.

We have identified our Avatar and intentionally designed our external marketing campaigns to attract the ideal patient.

We plan our marketing campaigns out several months in advance and diversify the delivering of our marketing to as many different effective avenues as our budget can tolerate.
---
# Cash Flow and Overhead Control

We are aware of the profession’s ideal expense percentages and understand that elevated expenses in any category decrease the owner’s profit.

We focus on profitability as our number one KPI secondary to productions, collections, and new patients.

We understand that debt is acceptable if it is leveraged to create more profit, not just more revenue. We also understand that incurring debt to purchase depreciating assets that do not generate a profitable ROI will decrease the owner’s net worth and cash flow.

We set hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly, adjusted production, collections, new patients and profitability benchmarks.

We track our KPI’s from month to month and year to year.

# Hiring, Firing and OnBoarding

We have a systemized process for recruiting and vetting potential new team members.

We have a systemized process for training and on-boarding all new team members.

We have clearly defined the benchmarks and expectations for all new team members set for 30, 60, and 90 days of hire date.

We have bi-monthly performance reviews and self-assessments during the 90 day “Get Acquainted” period.

We are clear with our new team member of expectations and consequences for underperformance.

We have a systematic process for firing any team member.

After completing the entire checklist, add up all the completed checks and then calculate a percentage score. Put that score below:

Total Items Completed: ____ / 45

Percentage Score: ______

Belt Status: ______________________
---
# Use the chart below to grade yourself:

|Overhead|Assessment Score|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|Phase 0 (White Belt)|Less than 40%|Above 60%|
|Phase 1 (Blue Belt)|40% - 60%|56% - 60%|
|Phase 2 (Brown Belt)|61% - 79%|51% - 55%|
|Phase 3 (Black Belt)|80% - 100%|Below 50%|

Typically we see most dental practice owners start below 40% systemization. If you have taken this test and have a score close to zero, do not sweat it! Many people start there. The good news is that using the resources in this book will get you up to the ‘Black-Belt’ phase quickly as long as you develop the habits to form these systems every day.

You might be wondering, “What does Black-Belt mean?” In the Dental Success Institute’s Elite Practice Mastermind, we use the ‘Black Belt’ moniker as the gold standard for what we all hope to achieve. This means that a dentist’s practice has an over 80% systemization score and a below 50% overhead number. In essence, a doctor is taking home half of all their revenues if they are the only doctor in the practice. We also have many doctors who do not do much clinical, and in these cases the dentists are still making 20-30% profit on the practice without even seeing patients.

As you progress through this book, use it as a resource to help you attack each section and get a better systemization score over time. Nothing happens overnight, but we are excited to help you get all the value out of this book and become more systemized!

# Chapter 2

# Foundational Principles

To have a successful practice, we need team members that are aligned with our vision, work hard, are humble and smart. This requires building a culture and leaders that allow us to escape management ourselves. In the early days of practice ownership we are involved in all situations regarding team members and patient concerns and situations. An Office Manager is typically our first line of defense against being dragged into every last decision in the office. Oftentimes even with an Office Manager in place, many practice owners still struggle with removing themselves from the day to day management of the practice. HR concerns, payroll, patient concerns, team situations, etc. arise, all while we’re in the chair spinning the handpiece, and we try to put out fires between patients or at the end of the day when we are exhausted from clinical and we may not address the situation as well as we would have hoped. What we are seeking is to show up better, have more problems solved the way we would want, (based on our leadership and culture philosophy) but with less of our involvement). So what do we do? We empower leaders in our practice, carve out true CEO time and work to elevate ourselves from technician to CEO.

When recruiting an Office Manager we sometimes advertise the position as “Practice Optimizer”. It seems that in dentistry some individuals seek the term “manager” in their title. There are a couple reasons we use the term “Practice Optimizer” or “Operations Lead”. First, you often still get Office Managers to apply, but the title change tends to attract former Office Managers that can set their ego aside, or candidates that are potentially stuck below an Office Manager at their current office, but have the potential to grow and flourish if given the opportunity for an expanded role. Second, if someone can set their ego aside and not worry about the title “Office Manager” we are likely already headed in the right direction regarding the culture we are looking to create.

Ultimately, as we scale and our teams reach a certain size, we may have an Office Manager or Practice Optimizer that oversees all, but there may also be a Clinical Director that acts like a parallel management level team member that supports and has synergy with the Office Manager. No one can do it alone, we as dentists can’t, and an Office Manager can’t. You may not need a true Office Manager when your operation is smaller, 6 employees or less. We always warn startup docs not to promote someone to
---
Office Manager too soon. All too often we see the all-star Treatment Coordinator promoted to Office Manager and only later do we find out, they were great at the job of Treatment Coordinator, but add the responsibility of managing and leading people to their plate and now you’ve lost a great Treatment Coordinator and have to figure out a way to take away the Office Manager title from this person, good luck. Now I’m not suggesting this ALWAYS happens, but it is a common pitfall, let’s say a 50/50 chance that person becomes a great OM, in other words take it slow, be slow to hand out the OM title and before doing so find ways to test their leadership along the way prior to handing out the title.

Note: An Office Manager needs to be familiar and even proficient at all other positions in the dental office. The purpose of this book is not to include every system from every department, we recommend you provide your Office Manager with all of our position manuals, but rather to give an overview of the other positions in the office that allow for their oversight.

# Office Manager Leadership Training Plan

Key rules to abide by are:

1. Assume the Best because no one wants to do a bad job.
2. Assume any mistake is one of misunderstanding (in other words there has been a communication breakdown somewhere, insufficient training).

# Office Manager Training Plan

12 week leader training program framework - when I first discovered that I needed to dedicate specific time to leveling up not only my own leadership, but also the team’s leadership, I decided if I could commit to a 12 week outline for training we could potentially cover a lot of ground fast and gain momentum. I am not suggesting we will have an amazing leader in 12 weeks. Leadership takes time and experience, but we could establish foundational principles of how we want leaders in our office to operate and handle various situations.

# Building a Leadership Team

# Hard Conversations

- 2 team members not getting along

# Reprimands

- Team member constantly showing up late
- Team member not living up to the culture
- Team member situations

# Addressing Gossip

Never be a part of gossip. Gossip is essentially pointing out the faults of someone that is not present, to feel better about yourself and get closer to the person that you are sharing those judgments with.

# How we handle raises

# Adding someone to the leadership team

# Leadership Training

Integrating a new team leader into the practice and getting team buy in.
---
When someone needs to be written up - before you fire someone you typically (in most states) need to document various instances of infractions. I’m not a huge fan of “writing people up”, however, it has been my experience with some people, they actually start to take the reprimands regarding their behavior more seriously after the’ve been “written up”. It also helps to have this documentation from an HR standpoint.

# Firing

The last thing we ever want to have to do is fire a team member, but there are times that we must protect the standards of the practice and protect the culture from certain individuals. It is our job to be crystal clear with expectations for our team members and set them up with the answers to the test so they can succeed, but there are still times where it just doesn't work out. Sometimes people self select out and other times we need to tell them that we are “freeing up their future”. We have provided resources here for your reference, but these are for reference and not to be taken as HR advice. We suggest whenever you have to let someone go to consult your HR support specialties and legal team if necessary because there are state specific rules, protected classes, proper steps that need to be followed to protect you and your business from any backlash.

# Integrity

---
# 10. Recognize and Celebrate Achievements

- Celebrate Milestones and Wins: Regularly acknowledge both team and individual achievements.
- Showcase Leadership Impact: Highlight the impact of leaders’ contributions to reinforce their importance and motivation.

# Hard Conversations

Likely, you are in the position to have the hard conversation, because the small things have added up, and you have avoided it for as long as possible.

1. Ask yourself what is contributing to the weight of this being a hard conversation?
- a. Is it your EGO?
- b. Is it the amount of time you have let it go unchecked?
- c. Have you previously demonstrated consistency on this issue with this employee or others?
2. What energy do you plan to bring to the conversation?
- a. Why do you think that energy will elicit the most effective outcome?
- b. Keep your goals of the conversation at the forefront.
- c. Do not show up angry.
3. Three parts of a hard conversation
- a. The Story that you have created in your head based on the information that you have
- b. The main character of the story
- c. Focus on your goal of the conversation, the outcome. And frame your wording accordingly. Don’t bring up a past encounter focus on how shifting behavior A can have a positive outcome for the employee and their teammates

# Reprimands

The longer you have ignored a problem or failed to address it, the more angry you will be when you finally address it. This framework can be applied to any unchecked employee issues. Some examples include an employee showing up late, not living up to cultural expectations, or not providing a top tier patient experience.
---
# Questions to Ask:

1. Do you want the employee to feel bad or do you want the behavior to change?
2. What matters more, being right or effecting change?

# Goal to Focus On:

1. What they need to know is how can the outcome be changed moving forward?
2. Don’t focus on the past.

# Problem Decision Tree

|Has it happened before?|Audit and revise your system|
|---|---|
|YES|You had a system and it failed|
|NO|You didn't have a system in place|
| |You had a system and didn't use it.|
| |Immediately audit your practice for Where else this error could arrive:|
| |Create system that addresses the problem|

# Addressing Gossip

Addressing gossip effectively is critical for maintaining a positive, productive, and respectful workplace that aligns with your workplace culture.

- Establish and Communicate Guidelines:
---
# Gossip in the Workplace

- Make it clear that gossip is discouraged, and emphasize the importance of respectful and open communication.
- Frame gossip as a violation of workplace values such as respect, trust, and teamwork.

# What is the root of Gossip?

- When you break gossip down, it is essentially the act of breaking down other people’s shortcomings.
- It is essential that you create and foster an environment, where employees trust and believe that there is no personal gain for them to point out the shortcomings of others.

# Make sure your team has the tools to end gossip when/if it reaches them.

- Typically gossip stems from a place of low self-esteem. Change the subject, and let the offending employee know that you think they are great and change the subject.
- Continue to reinforce and model the culture by your leadership actions, so that the team continues to feel safe and appreciated.

# Address Gossip Directly and in private

- Focus on how gossip affects the entire office.
- Encourage accountability.
- Inclusivity fosters creativity.

# How We Handle Raises

Money is earned by creating value, building relationships, and managing resources effectively. When an employee asks for a raise, you need to be prepared to have a comprehensive approach with planned responses, while also listening to their request.

# Who decides how much you get paid?

- The market.

# When someone asks for more money, as a business owner you see that as them asking how they can bring in more value to the business.

- What problems can they help you solve?
- How can they bring more value to your company’s culture?

# How do you build relationships and trust that benefit the employer and the employee?

- Having open conversations and creating a safe and open environment.
- Encouraging value adds and role adds and compensating fairly.
- Modeling the culture.
- Follow through on both sides.

# Adding Someone to the Leadership Team
---
1. Make sure there are clearly defined roles for the new team member as well as existing.
2. Ensure you have a comprehensive onboarding process to get them integrated with the leadership team as well as the whole office culture.
3. Build the foundations of a relationship of trust.
1. Schedule regular 1:1 meetings. (See meetings section in Chapter 5)
2. Encourage Peer mentoring
3. Get a list of their favorite things and encourage ways for the new employee to get to know the existing leadership team.
4. In the hiring process, hire them for their value add and be vocal about the value they are adding to the rest of the team.
4. Set them up for success.
1. Empower them with Quick wins.
2. Reinforce a culture of transparency and safety so that the new leader feels comfortable sharing their ideas and input.

# Leadership Training

The importance of building a strong leadership team leads to a greater sense of freedom for the practice owner as well as greater investment from employees in the mission and culture.

# What are the Benefits of Using Open-Source Software?

Open-source software development can bring in diverse perspectives beyond those of a single company. The Open Dental User Community is the driving force behind software updates. You get to vote on and drive software development!

The source code is accessible to third-party developers who can develop robust add-on software that syncs seamlessly with Open Dental. This gives you the choice of clearinghouses, billing companies, forms, confirmations, texting, emailing software, etc. It plays well with others! You are not tied to proprietary software. The availability of the source code enables those who can code with MySQL the ability to write custom reports.

It is important now that you learn the Open Dental Screen Layout and review modules. We suggest that the best resources and videos are actually created by the Open Dental software themselves. Here is a link to the YouTube Channel for the Open Dental Software: https://www.youtube.com/user/OpenDentalsoftware

# Treatment Coordinator Notes

# How to Avoid Over-explaining

1. LESS IS MORE
1. When you over explain it’s because you have a fear that they won’t believe you, so you give more detail in hopes that they will believe you know what you’re talking about.
2. The more words you use to tell the truth, the less believable it sounds.
3. When you give more detail, you aren’t preventing misunderstanding, you’re ensuring it.
2. DON’T ASSUME THEIR QUESTION BEFORE YOU ANSWER IT
1. If they want to know, they will ask. If they have a question, they will ask.
2. Instead of being a waterfall of information, be a well.
3. Next time you find yourself using the word “Because”, ask yourself: DID THEY ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION, OR DO I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY NEED IT?
1. If it’s because you feel like it, you can probably do better without it.

# Verbiage

It’s about WHAT we say & HOW we say it

Don’t ask questions…

- NOT “would you like to get those fillings scheduled?” Instead “LET’S GO AHEAD and get you on Dr. Blue’s schedule, how does next Tuesday at 3pm look?”
- Not “Do you want to take care of that…” Instead “Let’s go ahead and take care of that now…”
- Avoid: Yes or No Questions - it is harder to come back and take control of the conversation when you do not get the answer you want or expect
- “Do you have any questions?” vs “What questions do you have for me?”
---
NEVER EVER EVER talk about PPO vs. Premier on a NP call - they have no clue what you’re talking bout - if you find out they’re PPO only later - you call them back & have this convo

# Other Verbiage to Avoid

- CAN’T & UNFORTUNATELY instead say FORTUNATELY, I have great news
- Avoid talking about fee schedules - people don’t know what you’re talking about
- Avoid getting wrapped up in insurance conversations, let’s not forget the value we bring to the patient
- Never say the schedule is wide open- specify a couple times (start by offering the same time and day the next week)

# Treatment Presentation Fundamentals

- Avoid Word Vomit - power in some silence
- Speak Confidently and Clearly
- Creating Urgency
- Goal is same day Tx (if time allows- they are already here, saves a trip, saves practice money, etc.)
- Avoid Overwhelming the patient (prioritizing- can present 1st priority only if they seem very overwhelmed)
- Whenever someone offers you $ take it
- Pre collect if we can - do not give option

# Collecting

“It will be nine-ninety-eight today…” (do not say dollars)

If we take care of a patient don’t be afraid to take credit for it

Ex: “As a courtesy to you Dr. Blue went ahead and took care of that 3D X-ray”

# Presenting Treatment

# Smaller Treatment Plan (which will be completed in 1 visit)

Present all the treatment, MUST still re-iterate Urgency

Goal: Same Day or Get patient scheduled within 1-2 weeks with Doctor

1. Here’s the recommended treatment (summarize what doc said w/ urgency)
2. Your insurance is going to take care of a good portion of this, again anytime we’re dealing with insurance this is our best estimate
3. Your portion for everything is six-hundred-ninety
4. We can go ahead and take care of that today let’s get you on the schedule - how’s next Tuesday at 1 pm

# Power in Silence
---
# Very Large Treatment Plan

Once treatment has been prioritized…

Avoid overwhelming the patient “Foot in the door”

“Dr. Alex’s biggest concern is this first priority, we definitely want to get that taken care of right away, we find it best to focus on getting this done & then follow up with next steps…”

# Power in Silence

Helping block things together - explaining you only have to get numb once if we get half SRP and fillings together

Use oral sedation/ nitrous to help patients with dental anxiety- it is a great service

If they do say no- ask pt if we can follow up with them in a few weeks (add to audit list)

# Getting over Fears of talking about $$$

Remember- you did not create this problem - you are offering a solution

This problem will never get cheaper for the patient than it is today- you advocating for them to get it done now is your greatest ability to save them $

The problem is not going away by you avoiding the $ convo

Avoid making assumptions about the patient’s financial situation and their feelings about $, what they consider “expensive” etc

Don’t offer/bring up payment plans unless the patient asks

Don’t project your own personal view on $ & finances on the patient (It’s a free country and their choice how they want to spend their $)

# Breaking up Payments - Collecting

1. GOAL- Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan
3. In office payment plan- 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments- need proper paperwork
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford

# Example verbiage when patient accepts treatment, declines NG

“Apparently these guys don’t believe in preventing future damage and costs so they’re not going to pay for your NG but FORTUNATELY you do get a discount and as Dr. X discussed this is really going to help protect your teeth long term”

“So let’s go ahead and get you scanned for the NG ….”
---
“Let’s go ahead & get you schedule for X tx and that NG”

# Phone Tips

- Take a deep breath & SMILE
- Avoid rabbit holes, take control of the conversation
- Don’t get caught answering all of the questions, you need to lead the conversation
- TONE: match their tone - volume & speed
- AVOID - word vomit / too much info
- Communication is 55% non-verbal so on the phone all we have is 38% our tone and 7% the words we use
- Group Phone Training Idea: pick mostly good ones and a few bad ones and sit around and critique each other - make it fun!

# Common “difficult” phone call themes

- Patient Asks right away “Do you take my insurance”
- YOUR RESPONSE “I can absolutely help you with that, who can we thank for referring you to our office?”
- Patient calls to cancel &lt;48 hours notice
- YOUR RESPONSE “Ohhh, can I ask what’s going on?”
- “Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”
- How much does a crown cost
- YOUR RESPONSE “I can absolutely help you with that…”
- Goal: Create Value & Get them in for a consult with the doctor
- Do not give exact $ amounts for cost of tx we have not diagnosed

# Route Slip Protocol

APPOINTMENTS TO BE SET COMPLETE BY THE PROVIDERS ONLY. DAs and FO do not set appt. complete.

# Front Office:

- At the end of day, make sure all appointments are set complete
- Confirm the provider before sending the claim (The provider will set the appointments complete)

# Hygiene:

- Set appointments complete when the patient leaves.
---
# Appointment Procedures

# Make sure the correct codes are attached to the appointment before setting complete

to ensure claim is ready to be sent

- If Whitening or Fluoride is added to the current day appointment, add the codes before setting complete and collect the appropriate amount - if unsure of the correct patient portion, ask FO.

# Restorative:

- Collection is okay to be taken at the beginning of the appointment, this amount is noted on the appointment.
- If treatment changes mid appointment:
- Stop clinical work so that assistant can add the new treatment into Open Dental
- If a small procedure is added, continue with the treatment
- If a large procedure, or multiple procedures are added, have the treatment coordinator come back and let the patient know of the new patient portion.
- At the end of the appointment, bring the route slip up with the new treatment written at the top and ask a treatment coordinator if the new procedure code is correct and what the new patient portion is. (Treatment coordinator should write the new patient portion on the top of the route slip for the assistant to relay back to the patient in the op.)
- Walk the patient out and confirm again that the codes on the appointment are correct and get approval from the Doctor to set the appointment complete. (If a treatment coordinator is not available to confirm, mark the appointment as dismissed and leave the appointment as scheduled).
- If nothing changed, set the appointment complete as it was.
- FOR NOTES: Doctors will set appointments complete once procedures are correct. If you need to make a note in the chart, ask Dr. to set it complete to do so.

# Exam Sheet to become Proficient With

The Office Manager should be familiar with our expectations from the dental assisting team regarding patient workups and hygiene team regarding co-discovery (prepping the patient for the doctor exam). The following 2 images are laminated back to back and situated on the 12 o’clock counter in every restorative op. The assistants fill this out. It has 2 purposes. Firstly, it is a checklist to make sure the assistant has completely set up their room & gathered all of the correct photos and x-rays. Additionally, it tells us why the patient is here. One side is for an existing patient that is here for scheduled treatment and the other side is for a new or existing patient emergency.

(Weekend phone coverage)

Let's take care of our patients even when we are not at the office. The best way we can do this is to have a rotation. This is for weekends because typically we are open 5 days a week:

1. Return Emergency & New Patient Calls (many people call to change appointments or with account questions, anything like this is to be addressed first thing Monday morning)
2. Sunday Night: send a slack message to “weekend on call” thread with a call summary

Here are some tips to making this as easy as possible:
---
- Phone rotates between Doctors & OM
- Each person is on call for 1 month
- Let calls go to voicemail. Return call if VM says it is a toothache or New Patient
- Check Mango Voice every 2-3 hours (login info)
- If New Patient, guide them to fill out Flexbook to schedule an appointment from our website and tell them we will follow up with them on Monday.
- If Emergency/Toothache patient
- First determine if it is a true emergency
- If it’s an existing patient that had recent treatment with one of the doctors let the treating doctor know the situation before returning patient’s call so they can guide you as to how to address the issue
- For most situations patient can usually wait until Monday (Ex: re-cements / temps)
- Guide patient to FLEXBOOK to schedule emergency appointment online for Monday: inform them if they are using insurance it is very important to include all of this information on FLEXBOOK (send April email to verify their insurance first thing Monday)
- if no appointments are available Monday morning via FLEXBOOK make arrangements to squeeze them in to the schedule Monday.
- If prescription indicated:
- Gather information:
- Patient name
- Date of birth
- Preferred pharmacy
- Call in prescriptions with following information
- Doctor name, DEA #, office phone number and address
- Patient name and DOB
- Prescription- medication, instructions, quantity, frequency
- Pain: Motrin 800mg or Tramadol (Narcotics cant be called in over the phone)
- Antibiotic:
- (primary) Amoxicillin 500 mg, Dispense 30, take 2 stat and 3 per day until gone
- (secondary if allergic to amoxicillin / penicillin Clindamycin (300mg), dispense 30, take 2 stat and three per day until gone
- (last option) Z-Pack - dispense 1 pack, take as directed
- Follow up with patient in 12 hours to see how prescriptions are working
- On Monday make sure to note in patient chart all pertinent information & what prescriptions were called in
- If it is determined that patient needs to be seen immediately by doctor
- If new patient or existing patient with emergency that is not related to recent treatment performed by our dentists then inform patient that it is a $400 fee to open
---
the office after hours (if it is existing patient in regards to recent treatment and doctor has determined they would like to see patient then $400 will not be charged)

- A staff member will have to accompany doctor, no one should be alone in office with a patient
- For NP or patients that we cannot verify dental insurance: Charge cash fees then work with patient’s dental insurance during office hours and the patient will be reimbursed after insurance payment is settled.
- If VM is not pain related and canceling/financial related. Return call first thing Monday morning along with all other missed calls
- Send Summary in Slack of the calls from the weekend so front office knows how to proceed on Monday Morning at 7am

# New Patient Scheduling Addendum

If a new patient calls to schedule a cleaning, we ask when their last cleaning was. If it has been more than 3 years, there is a higher chance that they will need an SRP rather than a prophy.
---
If that is the case, we can find a 60 minute slot on the restorative side and schedule them for an FMX and Comprehensive Exam 60 minutes before Clo or Michelle’s scheduled break of 30 minutes (or random 30 min empty slot on hygiene side). If the patient does not end up needing an SRP, then Clo or Michelle will do a prophy during their 30 minute scheduled break (or any hygienist in a 30 min empty slot). This may require help from available assistants to possibly pull back the hygienist’s next patient (maybe do x rays or exam so we can all stay on schedule and make the most of our time.)

# How long ago was your cleaning

|6 months to 2 years ago|3+ years ago|
|---|---|
|Schedule as normal (90 mins NP on hygiene)|Find 60 mins restorative mins before Clo or Michelle 30 min break (or any random 30 min empty slot on hygiene side).|
|Proceed as normal| |

Patient needs prophy: Schedule FMX & Comp Exam

Clo or Michelle perio chart and prophy on 30 min break after NP appt

Patient needs SRP: Schedule SRP on different day as normal

Patient walks out happy: Boom.

# X-ray Billing Protocols (w/ Insurance)

New Patient without insurance

- Take FMX per our protocol and panorex for wisdom teeth, doctors request, or other as necessary

Adult New Patient that is Eligible for FMX:

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210
---
- Take FMX per our NP workup (4 BW-X Rays, 6 Anterior PAs, 8 Posterior PAs)
- A full mouth series (FMX) cannot be billed out with any additional x-rays. If FMX is taken, there should be no additional x-ray codes (PAs, Pano, etc) included on the claim, even if we pick up treatment, etc.
- If we take additional PA for any posterior tooth with a chief complaint -- DO NOT BILL
- If patient also needs a panorex due to wisdom teeth, doctor’s request or other, take Pano at no charge – DO NOT BILL

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX but IS Eligible for BW-X Rays

Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

Be sure to DESELECT the FMX code from the appointment/claim! (Here’s an EXAMPLE for why)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + select only 1 or 2 PA X-rays to take (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #22).
- If you need a Pano take one but DO NOT BILL
- - The total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.

If you see a note from ins coordinator not to send out PA x-rays, you can take them but DO NOT BILL (Sometimes PA x-rays are covered as basic, and/or deductible applies)

# Adult New Patient Not eligible for FMX or BW-X RAYS

Send on Claim: FMX only D0210

- Take FMX as normal (and pano as necessary) and bill out just FMX to insurance, these will get denied by insurance so factor into provider production because we will adjust off as a courtesy to the patient when the EOB is received.

# Child New Patient Eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 4 BW-X Rays and Pano 6 years old and up (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)

Send on Claim (Patients Ages 6-14): 4 BW-X Rays D0272 & Pano D0330

Send of Claim (Patients Under Age 6): Bill out 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# Child New Patient not eligible for FMX or Pano

- Take 2 BW-X Rays. (under 6, try and get 2 BW-X Rays)
- If pano is also needed take as necessary, but DO NOT BILL to insurance

Send on Claim: 2 BW-X Rays D0272

# NEW PATIENT - EMERGENCY

- If possible and the patient is eligible, we try to take a FMX (D0210) on a patient that is coming in for an emergency visit - even if their concern is isolated to just one tooth/area.
- If we are unable to get a true FMX (4 BW & 6 PAs), another combination that can be considered a FMX is to take 4 BW and a PANO!
- If patient is in too much pain to open their mouth, take a PANO and any BW and/or PAs that are pertinent to the tooth of concern

# Adult Recare Eligible for BW
---
Send on Claim: 4 BW D0274, 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), Addt’l PA D0230 (+tooth #)

- Take 4 BW-X Rays + 1 or 2 PA X-rays (Root Canals, Implants, #8, #24).
- - NO MORE THAN 2 PA X-rays because the total fees for submitted x-rays must not equal or exceed that of a FMX or services will be combined/recorded as a FMX and then all will be denied.

Pay careful attention to any note from ins coordinator that may indicate whether or not to send out PA x-rays – also pay attention to the patient portion.
- - This may be because only PA x-rays are covered at a lower %, and/or deductible applies. If deductible has been met, we will still send out, but may waive the pt portion for lower coverage on the PAs as a courtesy.
- If deductible applies to all x-rays including FMX or BW, we would bill out, and be sure to collect the deductible amount from the patient. We also DO always collect patient portions for FMX or BW x-rays if they are not covered @ 100%.
- If patient is maxed out, we wouldn’t bother taking or sending out additional x-rays that aren’t necessary, as we’d need to collect their patient portion.

We take a new FMX every 3-5 years unless needed for a specific reason before then.

# Adult Recare - DUE FOR X-RAYS but NOT Eligible for BW (plan allows only 1x/24 months)

Send on Claim: 1st PA D0220 (+tooth #), THREE Addt’l PAs as D0230 (+tooth #)

- In the instance that a plan only allows bitewings once in a 24 month period, some plans (such as Delta Dental) will allow you to take and bill out up to 4 PA x-rays in a visit.
- Hygienists may still choose to take bitewings and 2 PAs as usual, but on the claim, we will bill out 4 PAs

# Adult Recare - Eligible for FMX

Send on Claim: FMX (D0210)

- If the patient is due for x-rays and is eligible for a FMX and we have not taken one in 3+ years, delete the BW & PA codes and change to a FMX (D0210).

# PANORAMIC X-RAYS - no bill insurance most of the time

- Many times we take a Pano on patients for diagnostic/treatment related reasons (i.e. Wisdom teeth, implants or bridges, ortho, etc.).
- ONLY EVER BILL OUT A PANO TO INS IF IT IS PART OF A FMX COMBO (PANO + 4BW).
---
on potential production. Also, if you add the Pano to a visit where we are taking other x-rays, keep in mind that this can prevent us from getting paid for any other x-rays if the patient is not eligible for a FMX

# Denture Instructions to Verbalize with Patient

1. It is a major transition to go from teeth to dentures.
2. Dentures are uncomfortable, you will get sore spots.
3. Dentures provide 10% of the bite force that your natural teeth did.
4. There will be a significant learning curve to getting used to dentures so DON’T GIVE UP.
5. They will get loose over time and need to be relined.
6. You will need adjustments.
7. TIPS: start with soft foods and work your way up, read out loud, don’t just put them in a drawer.
8. Dentures Stink - but implants can help.

Verbiage for Patients who do not provide us with their insurance info
---
Goal- get out of the way of the problem that the patient and insurance company have created- we’re here to advocate for our patients, connect them to the problem they created and take responsibility for the situation they’ve created.

- To use in messages/texts/calls prior to appointment
- Preferred Option - “I really want to avoid you from being kept waiting by your insurance company. In order to have your appointment run smoothly we need you to respond by [date/time], otherwise we may be better off rescheduling to allow time for your HR department & insurance company to get you the correct information.”
- For patients who come to the office without info
- I see here in preparation for seeing you today we reached a few different times to gather your insurance information, were you able to get that to us? Ohhhhhh ok, I’m sorry.
- “I’m bummed you weren’t able to get that to us, I’m going to ask Karen to drop everything and gather that information, but it could take up to 45 minutes, you are welcome to hang out in the waiting room or maybe we should have you come back.”
- “I really hate to have to do this, but since we were unable to get your insurance plan verified before your appointment, we’ll need to charge you our full office fees for today’s visit. Once our team is able to determine your plan’s coverage, and insurance pays their part, we can refund the difference back to you.”
- “Since our billing team didn’t get the opportunity to check on your insurance coverage before you got here, I’m afraid we can’t be accurate with our cost estimations during your visit. If you’d like to proceed with [treatment] today, we can collect full office fees from you now, and issue you a refund after insurance pays their portion. Otherwise, maybe we should reschedule to another day after we’re able to get in touch with your insurance carrier.”

# APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATION PROTOCOL

1. Automated (FLEX), SAVE THE DATE text/email message at time the patient makes an appointment. (Sent to everyone, depending on preferences)
2. Automated (FLEX), SAVE THE DATE, 30 days out via text. (Sent to everyone)

Appointments NOT CONFIRMED 48 business HOURS before are moved to UNCONFIRMED COLUMN. (#DND# anyone that goes to dummy column)

Appointments not confirmed by DAY of the appointment

Text patient right away upon arriving to the office that day:

Hello, (PATIENT’S NAME)! This is (YOUR NAME) with ABC dental, please call our office right away regarding today’s reservation!

Appts missed Voicemail ---

"Hey John, this is (YOUR NAME) with ABC dental. I'm calling to check in on you, I'm concerned and hoping that you're OK! We had you down for an appt this AM with Carlie and are concerned that something happened for you to have missed it. Please give us a call back ASAP!"

# Pre-Collection Protocol

1. GOAL- Collect patient portion in full at time of service (this should be the case 90% of the time!!!)
2. Breaking Up payments ½ at prep ½ at delivery is OK but a BACKUP plan
3. In office payment plan- 50% down and break up into 3-4 payments- need proper paperwork
4. Care Credit or other 3rd party financing
5. Do the amount of treatment the patient can afford

# When do we pre-collect for an appointment?

- ANY restorative appointment with Dr. Green, no matter the length
- ALL sedation appointments
- For any appointment 1 hour or more with any provider(s) - Dr. Matt, Dr. Brianna, Hygienists (i.e: Fillings, Crowns, SRP, Implants, RCT’s, Sedation, EXT):
- GOAL is to pre-collect for FULL patient portion in advance
- At a minimum we MUST pre-collect $100 per hour for the reserved appointment
---
IF the patient portion for this appointment is less than the “deposit”, then we must pre-collect patient portion in FULL

# Helpful Verbiage to use with patients

- “Dr. Green has limited clinical hours and he does often book out several weeks in advance. so we take a deposit/pre-payment to reserve that spot for you.”
- “Normally we’d collect $100 per hour to reserve that time with Dr. Green, but since your patient portion ends up as less than that, we can just collect the full $XX.XX”.
- To assure we allot the appropriate appointment time with Dr. Green, we do require a deposit of $100 per hour to reserve this time with him.
- No matter how full the schedule is in reality, we want to indicate that Dr. Green’s time is limited and valuable.
- “Looks like we can squeeze you in with Dr. Green on…”
- “We can make ___ work”
- Actually this is rare, that I will be able to get you in at this time with him on this day as he typically books these up first for this type of appointment.

# Sedation Appointments:

- “We collect in advance for sedation appointments since you/the patient will be sedated and there’s so many other things going on when you come back in”
- If you prefer, we can take a $300 deposit to hold the spot now. We will need your patient portion paid in full by the day before the appointment” (Friday if it’s a Monday appointment).
- ***** SEDATION APPTS SHOULD BE PRE-COLLECTED IN FULL - NO EXCEPTIONS *****

# EXAMPLE:

Joe is scheduled on Monday at 2pm with Dr. Green for #1-EXT, #2-OL, and #3-MOL. (1 hour appt) We would want to collect a $100 deposit, but the patient portion is estimated to be $68.20, so we will collect that in full

TC: Joe, looks like I could squeeze you in at 2pm on Monday, February 17 with Dr. ABC?

Joe: Sure.

TC: Perfect! And I can go ahead and collect that $68.20 today, to reserve this appointment.

Joe: Can I just pay it the day of the appointment?

TC: Typically we require a deposit of $100 per hour for any reserved appointments, but we estimate that your patient portion for this appointment will only be $68.20, so I can just collect that.

Joe: Oh, okay (hands me his card)

TC: Thanks, Joe! Just keep in mind that we do require 48 business hours for any changes to this reserved appointment with Dr. ABC.

Joe: What happens if I call the day before because I get called into work?

TC: Oh, I would hate for that to happen. By chance if it does, we can just apply $50 of this deposit towards our appointment change fee.

Joe: Okay, thanks! I’ll let you know if anything changes.
---
TC: Sounds great, Joe! We look forward to seeing you at your reserved appointment with Dr. Green on Monday, February 17th at 2pm.

Example: Rose is scheduled on Monday February 10th at 5pm for a 1 hour appointment with Dr. Green for #3-Implant (placement). The patient portion is estimated to be $450.20. We would first try to collect $450.20, and at MINIMUM collect a $100 deposit to reserve this appointment.

TC: Rose, looks like I could squeeze you in at 5pm on Monday, February 17 with Dr. ABC?

Rose: Sure, I think I could make that work.

TC: Perfect! And I can go ahead and collect the $450.20 to reserve this appointment.

Rose: Oh no, that's okay. I will just pay for it that day.

TC: Absolutely, Rose. I will then just collect the $100 deposit to reserve this appointment, and you can pay your remaining estimated patient portion of the $350.20 on this date.

Rose: Why do you have to collect anything today?

TC: Rose, that is a great question! To assure we allot the appropriate appointment time with Dr. Green, we do require a deposit of $100 per hour to reserve this time with him. Actually this is rare, that I will be able to get you in at this time with him on this day as he typically books these up first for this type of appointment.

Rose: Okay, not a problem. I’ll go ahead and take care of it all now. (hands me the card)

TC: Thanks, Rose! Just keep in mind that we do require 48 business hours for any changes to an appointment. We look forward to seeing you that Monday, February 10th at 5pm with Dr.

# Patient Calls on short notice (&lt;48 Business hours) to change their appointment

“Ohhhh…...Can I ask what’s going on?” (Listen)

“Are you sure there’s no way you can make it?”

# Show Empathy...

|Unacceptable excuses|Acceptable excuses|
|---|---|
|Not feeling well, caught up at work, something came up with kids, they have a hair or other appointment|Death, hospital visit, sickness with vomiting, highly contagious (mono, pink eye, strep, the flu)|

# My Kid is Sick

“Do they have a fever?, bring them in we’ll find something for them to do”

“Oh you’re sick? That’s ok, we all wear masks”

“You’re having car trouble? That’s ok we’ll send you an uber…”

“Oh you have another appt?, I’m sure they’ll let you see them after us”

“I’d really like to find a way to keep you on the schedule today to help you avoid the last minute appointment change fee”

“yes we require 48 business hours for any appointment changes to avoid the $129 fee”

# After this if they absolutely Must change appt.

“Ok, well the next available appointment FOR YOU, is going to be at least 2 weeks out…”

# First Offense

“Yeah the appointment you had is really prime real estate, but I understand emergencies do happen so I will go ahead and take care of that for you today, but please remember we do appreciate at least 48 business hours notice in the future”

(Book them 2 weeks or more out during non-prime hours)

# Second Offense (within 18 months)

“Yeah you had a real prime appointment time, I’m really not suppose to do this, but I’ll go ahead and take care of this a second time”

“To book another appointment a credit card will need to be kept on file in case of another last minute change”

- Collect Credit Card info on proper form
- (Book them 4 weeks or more out during non-prime hours)

# Cancellation Protocol - What to do with the Appt

- Post $129 charge (missed/late cancelled appt) and adjustment (1st missed/late cancelled appt)
- Print statement & mail to patient with 1st failure letter (scan into chart & make commlog notes)

# Second Offense Actions

# Cancellation Fee Rules

First and foremost we must use the dummy column for unconfirmed appointments - we must decide if texting them that if they don’t confirm and if we don’t hear from you it’s $129 we will give it to someone else gives them an “excuse”

# First Offense

Same protocol - emergencies come up, we tell them “I can take care of that $129 late cancellation notice for you this time, but next time we will have to charge you the $129”

And send out the letter and adjusted statement

If they say “I know you need to charge me the cancellation fee…” tell them “Ok I can go ahead and take your card for that”

# Second Offense

Charge patient $129 - take down their credit card for if there is a 3rd offense

# Third Offense

Charge patient $129. This is not a quality patient. They can call us for same day appointments. Put “Do NOT AUDIT - chronic canceller” in pop up

# New Patient - Second Offense

Whether hygiene or restorative appointment - appoint them on Doctor side for 30 minutes

“Yeah you know we had Michelle’s time blocked for you for that 90 minute new patient cleaning so let’s get you in to get exam and x-rays and get you back into the cue for a cleaning”

“Alternatively we could collect you patient portion now to reserve that 90 minute new patient cleaning and refund you after insurance pays”

“Yes that would be a non-refundable deposit”

We are writing in regards to your missed/rescheduled appointment. A missed/reschedule dental appointment presents problems for us both. For you, a missed/reschedule dental appointment causes a delay in treatment to help improve your dental health. For our office, a missed/reschedule dental appointment prevents us from scheduling another patient that could benefit from treatment. We schedule individual time with each patient to allow us to deliver the quality, personal care that every patient deserves.

As part of our financial policy, we charge $129 for each missed or rescheduled appointment with less than 48 business hours’ notice. This time, we have waived this fee as a courtesy. We still want to take a moment to review our financial policy.

We thank you for your trust and patronage at our office, but please understand that we schedule time in our schedule to be with you, and we would appreciate it if you honored that time we have set aside. For the future, we are simply going to ask you to be very faithful about keeping all dental appointments.

We understand that things happen, and schedules do change and we ask that in the future you provide us with at least 48 business hours’ notice for any appointment changes. Failure to provide at least a 48 business-hour notice for changed appointments will result in missed appointment charges and eventual dismissal from the practice.

We value you as a patient and look forward to seeing you for future appointments.

In good health,
The Team at XYZ dental

# Sample Appointment Failure Letter # 2
---
We are writing in regards to your recent missed appointments. There have been multiple appointments now that we have not received 48 business hours notice from you. We value you as a patient and would like to continue to provide you the care that you deserve. Our policy is to charge $129 dollars per missed appointment.

Going forward, we will require that you call us to see if we have any same day appointments available. A missed/rescheduled dental appointment presents problems for us both. For you, a missed/rescheduled dental appointment causes a delay in treatment to help improve your dental health. For our office, a missed/rescheduled dental appointment prevents us from scheduling another patient that could benefit from treatment. We schedule individual time with each patient to allow us to deliver the quality, personal care that every patient deserves.

We hope that you understand our goal of this policy is not to get “something for nothing,” but rather to provide the best care by having efficient scheduling that serves all of the members of our community.

We value you as a patient and look forward to seeing you for future appointments.

In good health,

The Team at ABC Dental

# Filling Hygiene Schedule

While doing One Week Calls:

- When patients call and cancel, the dummy code is put in the appointment and the reason is put in the appointment notes. We are going to start putting more notes at the top of the appointment notes in capital letters with the following information: “PROVIDER AND SERVICES THAT WERE ATTACHED TO APPOINTMENT”
- When hygienists go do their one week calls they will look one week back and see if their name as the provider is in any of the appointment notes
- If they see their name on the top of the appointment notes they will check that person's account to see if they have already rescheduled or not
- If they have rescheduled no need to call
- If they have NOT rescheduled they will make a call or text that patient to get them rescheduled

# Weekly Hygienist Filing Schedule Protocol:

1. Each week the front office will print the Divergent Dental Recall List
2. The list will be located by the third computer in the front in the folder labeled ‘HYG AUDIT LIST’.
3. When hygienists have downtime they can start working through the list.
4. Audit! Please call or text the patient and then make appropriate commlog notes/documentation.
5. Please read the notes first!! Do NOT call if it is a contrast patient or notes about patient moving, etc.
6. IF that happens please inactivate and put the reason for inactivation in the chart. OR go to ‘Family’, double click in the recall section, double click on the cleaning and mark the box ‘Always Disabled’. This will take them off of the future lists if we do not want to call them but also do not want to inactivate the patient.
7. After reading the notes and making sure they are a good patient to audit, cross off the name on the list once you call or text them and put your initials next to the patient's name.
8. We will work fully through this list every week. A new one will be added weekly.
9. If this list is completed already please see below to look for more opportunities!

# Schedule

See if any patients on the doctors schedule around your open appointment time also need a cleaning. If so, call the patient and let them know we can get them in at that time and knock out two birds with one stone.

Also, if any family members are in need of cleanings then call to see if they can come at the same time as their family.

# OPTION 3: Check Recall List

At the front desk in the silver file holder next to front desk phone there will be a 1-2 page weekly recall list.

Google Docs has text verbiage already made or you can add your own and copy and paste into flex to text patients.

# OPTION 4: Look ahead 1-2 weeks

If there is a gap in the schedule look ahead a week or two and see if patients at that time would like to move their appointment up a week but keep the same time. Check if pt is eligible to be seen early before calling. Let pt know that “we had availability to see them a week/two weeks early and wanted to offer that appointment to them.” Avoid using phrases as “cancellation” or “filling schedule.”

***FO will also help with the Hygienist’s Divergent List!

*** An automated text goes out daily to patients that are overdue for recalls if we have openings.

*** Hygienist will schedule PMV patients out for two 3MRC at a time to ensure time available.

# ABC DENTAL CARE FINANCIAL POLICY

# Assignment and Release

I the undersigned assign directly all insurance benefits to ABC Dental Care, if any, otherwise payable to me for services rendered. I understand that I am financially responsible for all charges whether or not paid by insurance. I hereby authorize the practice to release all information necessary to secure the payment of benefits.

# Patient Agreement and Financial Policy

I hereby agree to be responsible for the costs of care provided by ABC Dental Care and/or the dental team for myself or my dependent(s). These include any deductibles and amounts not covered by insurance. I also understand that it is my responsibility to be aware of any limitations, and benefits of my insurance policy. Payment to this office is my responsibility and I am aware that if the insurance company does not reimburse the practice, I am responsible for the total amount(s).

# Payment

We require that payment be rendered on the date of service. We will estimate the amount of copay required from the information that your insurance company provides to us. Please keep in mind that we make every effort that these estimates are accurate, we cannot possibly be correct 100% of the time due to the many clauses and stipulations that are inherent in the individual policies. In other words, every policy is unique, and the estimate is not a contract. In the case that your insurance company pays less than we estimate, you will be responsible for the balance. I understand after 30 days of receipt of a statement from ABC Dental Care, any unpaid balance will incur a 1% per month billing fee. I understand that failure to pay amounts due to this office will result in my account being placed with a collection agency. In the event that my account is further referred to an attorney, I agree to pay all collection and attorney fees.

# Types of payment accepted include

# Credit Card on File Policy

We strive to provide the highest quality dental care and ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all of our patients. To this end, we have implemented a policy requiring a credit card on file for all patients effective 11/1/2024. We will now start securely collecting a credit card at time of your appointment to streamline payments for copays, deductible, non-covered services, late and no-show fees. We will be notifying families of any balances after insurance payments are received and before we process any transactions. Some insurance plans require deductibles and copayments in amounts not known to you or us at the time of your visit. Much like many other businesses such as a hotel or car rental agency, we now have a similar policy where we ask for a credit card number at the time you check in.

Circumstances when your card would be charged include but are not limited to:

- Any co-payments, deductible and/or co-insurance not collected from you at your visit.
- Missed or canceled appointments without 48-hour notice (per our Broken Appointment Policy)
- Any non-covered services and/or denial or services allocated to patient responsibility
---
Any insurance payments sent to the subscriber/patient instead of to our office Outstanding balances greater than 90 days.

Please note that patient families will still retain the right to dispute a charge or question your insurance policy’s determination of payment.

By signing below you confirm that you have read our financial policy and consent to us drafting the credit card on file to take care of the unpaid balance less than $150. Before ever charging anything to your credit card in case you would like to make another arrangement.

# Appointment Policy

I understand that because appointments are not double-booked, I must provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time. For appointments with a doctor scheduled for 60 minutes or longer, I will be required to make a reservation fee of $100 per hour prior to scheduling the appointment, which will be applied to my out-of-pocket expense for that appointment. This reservation fee is non-refundable. If I do not show up for my appointment or I do not give adequate notice if I am unable to keep my appointment, the reservation fee will be forfeited.

For all appointments where a reservation fee is not required, a $129 cancellation fee will apply if I do not provide notice of cancellation at least 48 business hours prior to my scheduled appointment time.

We understand your lives are busy and as a courtesy to our patients, we reach out via Text, Email and/or Phone to confirm all appointments. It is critical that you respond to confirm your appointment. For any appointments not confirmed 48 business hours prior to your appointment time, we have to assume you are forfeiting that appointment and we will start to open up that valuable time slot to other patients. (FOR EXAMPLE: if your appointment is Monday @ 1pm, you must confirm by Thursday prior @ 1pm.)

# Kolbe Test

A Kolbe test is a great tool. It is not a personality test, instead it gives us insight into how people approach work / projects. It follows four categories - fact finder, follow through, quick start, implementor. It is valuable to know your team’s (especially your leadership team’s) Kolbe score and to have a balance of different qualities. Example: if you have all quick starts, you will have a bunch of cool exciting ideas, but without someone that ranks high on follow through nothing will get done.

# Languages of Appreciation in the workplace

We like to know our team members' language of appreciation (also know as love languages). This helps us reward or acknowledge people in the way that they like to receive appreciation, not how WE like to receive it or what we THINK they want.

# Standards of Service / Non-Negotiables

- The doctor always slows down, greets the patient with enthusiasm, sits & faces the patient, gives post-op instructions (assistant also summarizes post-op instructions)
- The doctor tells them that if they need anything at all not to hesitate to call even on a weekend
- We always summarize procedure/appointment and inform before we perform
---
- We always give post-op instructions
- We always edify our teammates
- Every new patient sees the new patient slide show
- We ask for a referral or a review when we receive a compliment (SEND VIA Swell)
- (NOTE in the patient note section of Open Dental after we have done so in order to ensure we do not ask the same patient the same thing every time)
- Every patient that receives anesthetic receives a post-op call
- Every new hygiene patient receives a welcome call from the hygienist
- Every patient is greeted as they walk in the door (even if we are on the phone)
- Introduce yourself, invite the patient to follow you back & ask how their day is going
- We are consistent: same level of service every time (try and keep patients with same clinical team members (doctor, hygienist, assistant) whenever possible)
- We track all new patient referral sources
- Offer water or drink while hanging out
- Don’t abandon the patient
- Comfort cart
- We provide on-time appointments (if they must wait we move them to different stations to remove the feeling of waiting)
- Regular audits to keep our doctor and hygienist schedules full and productive

Associate Dr.
Hygienist
Front Office
Back Office
Treatment Coordinator
Other Positions

# STEP 3: Circle the traits above that really resonate with you and are highest priority: Draw a line through the ones that are not:

# Vision

A fulfilling team culture that is engaged with our community through acts of service and provides a welcoming/empathetic patient experience through genuine patient and team relationships.

A team culture that is safe and relaxed allows for connectedness and fulfillment. We have each other’s back, communicate clearly, and ALWAYS assume the best. We take responsibility for our actions and the results that we create. We bring good vibes because the way we show up to the world is a choice and our goal is to have a positive impact on each other’s experience.

We strive to make our community a better place. We will do this through donations of time, money, and supplies to those in need. We will engage and educate. Our community knows that we are approachable, available, and determined to have a positive impact.

Our patients feel seen, valued, and heard because we lead with empathy and seek to understand. Rich relationships are foundational. Patients say their experience at our office is refreshingly different.

We are a dynamic business always on the forefront, paving our own way as we embrace new ideas and work through complex problems. We are a financially healthy organization that strives for efficiency and leads with integrity.

Yes this issue with Connection that you described is a major issue for anyone dropping any umbrella network. Here is what I recommend you do:

1. Have your Connection Termination acknowledgement letter (that includes your actual Connection Dental termination date) prepared in a pdf copy.
2. Send that letter to any insurance plan that is paying you in-network under Connection and demand that they perform an audit going back to the Connection termination date to reprocess all claims that were incorrectly paid in-network.
3. Warn the dental plan that if they do not comply with this request that you will bring forward legal action and will report their fraud to the State Insurance Commissioner, Department of Justice that oversees ERISA dental plans, and your State Attorney General's Insurance Fraud division. With this warning every insurance plan usually works quickly to correct claims to out of network status as they do not want to deal with government regulators that will impose additional fines for violating insurance laws on the state and federal level.

Follow up with emails with the supervisor so you have time stamped proof.

Work your way up the chain of command.

Once you have a point of contact send them the EOB directly when they make a mistake.

“I need your first and last name and a reference number for your call, please direct me to your supervisor…”

“If we do not receive payment for this claim within 7 business days we will instruct the patient to file a claim with the state insurance board, thank you.”

“We have made a claim to the state insurance board and your late payment will result in interest charges.”

# De-Escalating Patient Situations

168
---
I thought I’d share this because it came up in conversation with a doc that I know, and I think the best. Time to visit the things that bring us the most brain damage is when all is well that way if or when a situation does arise (luckily very rarely) we are more prepared and thus can approach the situation with hopefully less stress and more confidence.

Each situation is unique but this is a basic framework.

# Step 1

- Mindset - think “Do I need to be right or do I want to be effective”
- The need to be right so the patient is wrong will almost always escalate a situation faster, so come with the mindset I want to be effective. Being effective looks like the least amount of headache, and least amount of financial and time commitment and I would prioritize time over money here. If you’re focused on keeping money in your pocket here, that’s fine, but you will often pay a greater price if you stick your heals in on that mindset.

Sincere Second Degree Acknowledgement. To de-escalate the patient.
- This is sometimes all it takes. (refer to link above for training)

But let’s say we gave our best crack at second degree acknowledgement and that’s just not good enough for this person.
- Carefully document the interaction

# Step 2

- If we are in person with patient, we want to avoid talking in circles, which is often what these patients will drag us in to.
- Never get into a back and forth. “This hasn’t gone the way either of us expected or wanted, why don’t we curb the conversation and follow up on a call”
- We can ask their permission that this call is recorded, usually not permissible as evidence but it will help us dictate clear notes of the situation.
- We may get on 1 call with them, but this isn’t going to be a series of calls and emails, typically you want to say less than necessary.
- Let them get into word vomit, not you.
- Depending on the situation or “threat” this may be the time to contact Malpractice carrier for advice.
- Contact Malpractice Carrier: you want to notify the malpractice carrier of a developing situation earlier rather than later. There is no cost to contact them, you simply tell them, “here is the situation that is developing, nothing has happened yet, do you have any advice at this time”
- DO NOT allow for this to turn into an email thread if possible. If it turns this direction and the patient starts making demands via written email, this will automatically trigger malpractice requiring a lawyer to get involved and result in a case being open up on your record.

# Step 3:

169
---
Depending on the situation, see what options you have to appease the patient to make the situation right in their mind to avoid a lawsuit:

1. Refund the patient?
2. Courtesy treatment/remake?
3. If you have a close relationship with a specialist see what they would be willing to do to help mitigate the situation

Note: Do not make any promises to pay for a patient’s specialty care or any other costs (i.e. time off work, pain, suffering etc). This can be considered a settlement and will need to be reported to the dental board.

# Step 4

Let’s say, a patient threatens that they’ve gotten or will be getting their lawyer involved.

Don’t be cavalier about this, but you may calmly let them know…please go ahead and give us your attorney’s number and we’ll give him a call, we’re happy to talk to him. (The tone here is not cocky, but such that, no problem we aren’t scared, neutral demeanor)

# Remember

- Photography, good notes, proper documentation will save your butt
- I would hope there’s no negligence on our part and the consent they signed doesn’t guarantee a result, it just guarantees they were told everything to make an informed decision for themself. We have no idea how

# Addressing Contrast Situations

|Deep Breath:|The are confused:|De-Escalate:|
|---|---|---|
|Control our energy, there is nothing to argue about|where is the miscommunication or misunderstanding|2nd Degree|

2nd degree acknowledgement - they’re loaded for bear and want their feelings validated

1. Action: Hold on, the phone cut out for one second and I wanted to make sure I heard you correctly…
1. You were expecting X
2. But Y happened
3. And WE’RE looking for answers as to what’s going on
2. Impact: “This is not what either of us were expecting, I want you to know we’re taking this seriously”
3. Feeling: “I know this couldn’t feel good for you because it sounds very frustrating”
---
# AVOID:

1. Talking in circles
2. Answering questions you don’t have the answer to
3. Having to be right

“Ok I’m going to step in right there because this is important”

“I’m looking forward to taking care of this for you”

“Let me put you on a quick hold to see what game they’re (the insurance company) playing”

Pin it back on us against insurance…

“This is what they’re doing to us, here’s what we’ve done to try and get them to do what they’re suppose to, but I see them play this game all the time and I don’t have a lot of confidence that they’re going to do what we expected”

If Patient needs to be dismissed: refer to Dismissing Red Flag Patients and have Dr. G or OM do that.

# Top 3 things patients call mad about:

1. Insurance didn’t pay something & they have a bill
2. In Network or OON
3. Treatment ?

# Dismissing & Red Flag Patients Protocol

Kindly refer these patients out…

(Luckily 95% of patients are amazing, but we need a strategy to mitigate these negative experiences with the other 5%)

Remember: “They’re just CONFUSED” - always take the high road

# Front Office:

(Referral- Have someone to refer them to that would be a “better fit”)

Screening these patients on the phone. These are usually going to be people that off the bat you can tell are going to be problematic, long winded, asking too many questions, blaming prior dentists, sometimes combative from the start.

Use your best judgment.

Tell them… “Based on what you’re telling me, I don’t want to waste your time, I want you to know our office is probably not the best fit for you, but Dr. ______ also in _____ can take great care of you, his number is 555-555-5555” (if you give them an alternative solution they’re less likely to get mad)

OR - for an existing patient that we’ve denoted as RED FLAG- DO NOT RESCHEDULE or if you thought the patient had left practice already & isn’t welcome back…

(confirm that we have Turned off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders)

# The FIRM approach

“you know last time you were here we know there were some concerns you had and Dr. XYZ feels this practice might not be the best place for you and we’d like to help you find another dentist…”

# Softer Approach

“Dr. XYZ is booked out for 6 weeks & in these situations it’s very important you are seen right away, Dr ABC will take great care of you…”

# Hygiene

- Do not schedule their recall...put a pop up “RED FLAG -Do Not Reschedule”
- Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate

# Restorative

- Do not reschedule patient after final restorative appointment is complete
- put a pop up “RED FLAG - Do Not Reschedule”
- Turn off review requests & unscheduled Treatment Reminders & Inactivate

# Doctor

if a patient is constantly complaining about the service or the work then perhaps it’s time for them to look for a new dentist.

“Our working together just doesn’t make sense, it makes you upset and then it makes me upset because you’re upset, so there’s a doc that I know that I think you’re gonna like- his name is Dr. ABC and Lindsey will get you his phone number…I think he gonna be a better fit for you”

# If the Doctor is in the room with a patient that drags them down the path…

“Let me bring in the expert” … “I’m gonna go get Lindsey, she’s really the expert here, Lindsey here’s what going on, angry Jim Bob here has some questions about… how can we handle this Lindsey…”

- the Treatment coordinator or office manager has already been debriefed on this situation and they know what tools they have in their pocket to resolve the situation whether it’s a refund or referral or discount - the expert will deliver the news/solution - in the future then Lindsey sees the patient smiling “hey Andy what’s going on?”

# Dealing with Patients that try to bypass - team to get to Dr. ABC…

# How to protect yourself from bad reviews…

# Helpful Verbiage with contrast patients

- “We shouldn’t do business together. We just shouldn’t do it, it doesn't make sense.”
- “We haven’t been able to satisfy your needs, this happens…”
- “We’ve reached the end of our working relationship” (FIRM version) - “tell us where to send your records, if we don’t hear from you, here are some people we could recommend”
- “What is it exactly that you thought you were expecting but didn’t get from our practice ?”
- “what were you expecting?” It’s not “what do you need”

# Dismissing patients

THE LETTER for Dismissing- dismissal letter is a last resort (try not to have to write a dismissal letter while the fire is hot bc it could make it worse, maybe send it later if you need to but hope that they go elsewhere and self select out…)
---
# Example Dismissal Letter

DATE:

To the Attention of:

Patient Name

Address

This letter is to inform you that the team at XYZ dental will no longer be able to provide dental care to you or your family.

We strongly believe that a dentist-patient association built on mutual trust, respect & understanding is vitally important to a patient’s oral health. Over the past several months, it has become apparent that optimal oral health care based upon our treatment recommendations is failing to meet your expectations.

Your current oral health status is quite stable, so for the next 30 days from the date of this letter, we will be available for emergency care only to you and your family. Should this occur, full payment will be expected at the time of service. Should you require a statement from the attending doctor a receipt will be provided for you to submit to your insurance carrier. Once you have located a new dental practice of choice, please fill out the enclosed form required by HIPAA for you to sign and return to us before your records can be sent.

We recommend that you do not hesitate in finding a new provider as preventative and proactive oral health care is the most optimal way to maintain your oral health. Should you have any difficulty in locating a new dentist in your area, you may contact the Colorado Dental Association at 303-740-6900.

Respectfully,

Dr. ABC

- Say this not that verbiage

First of all, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of one of our dear friends and mentor Alastair Macdonald. Alastair has shared many great concepts for handling difficult conversations with patients. At the top of the list is tricky insurance conversations with patients. Littered throughout this chapter are ideas from Alastair that have helped our practices (and many others) minimize the negative outcomes that can be associated with insurance companies not doing what they say they will and thus patients being upset with us. We have found with proper delivery of some of the verbiage
---
shared in this chapter, patients will understand these situations for what they are and not look to blame us for all of their unmet insurance related expectations.

# Dealing with patients that are trying to blame us BUT really they are upset with insurance…

“Ok, so this morning Ingrid spent 45 minutes on the phone with your insurance company getting as much info out of them as she could, based on that conversation Ingrid had with your insurance this is what I estimate this treatment will cost, however, based in my experience with Cigna, I want you to know there is ample reason to expect these guys to behave badly, unfortunately Cigna has a history of coming back and making YOUR life miserable…”

“Now remember we already extend a XXX% discount to you so you don’t have to worry about that, but I know these guys and more often than not they are gonna come back and pay less in fact what myself & friends that work at other dental offices report seeing lately is they’re paying based on fees far below industry standards- that’s why the ADA is suing insurance companies like Humana - so don’t be surprised if this happens. So here’s what we are gonna do, after this discount (the in network discount), we are going to go with this amount here (circle it and initial) and let’s watch what happens. If there is one thing you and I both know it’s that insurance companies will never show up the way you or I expect them to. So in the event they come back and don’t pay as much as we are expecting, this will be infuriating to me so first I’ll go and sit down with Ingrid and we will go to battle for you and issue an appeal with them, but if we lose that battle we may need to work out a payment plan or something, we just can’t plan for all scenarios with these guys. SO fingers crossed, they’re not going to do this to US. 80% of the time we get the estimate perfect but it’s that 20% of the time that insurance doesn’t pay what we expect that causes major headaches for our patients”

# Additional helpful Verbiage

“We do everything we can to protect you from these guys but they’re still brutal”

“Remember it doesn’t matter what metropolis in the world you fly into - the tallest buildings in the world are insurance companies, so these parasites are screwing us all over, this is exactly how they pay for those tall buildings”

“We are very insurance friendly but we look at dental insurance as a coupon book…”

“We do everything we can to outsmart these guys and get accurate estimates for you, but ultimately it still is only an estimate”

“We constantly update your plan info and spend lots of time researching how we can maximize your benefits…”

“Insurance maximums have been $1,000 since 1970, 50 years”
---
# Additional Insights

1. Assume any errors are errors of understanding - patients don’t understand that these numbers are the insurance companies’ numbers - the numbers I’ve given you are in good faith from our research with your insurance company. (Get out of the way of your patient and their insurance company - matador) these figures are not my figures, these are YOUR insurance companies figures. I am simply the person that is holding the piece of paper so don’t kill the messenger. We’ve gone in and plugged the treatment plan in with what YOUR insurance company has shared with us about YOUR policy and here is what they tell us it will cost. If you’ve been alive as an adult for any amount of time then you’re aware you can’t trust an insurance company as far as you can throw them. We know insurance companies are prone to changing their minds so be aware we take these figures from your insurance company with a hefty grain of salt. This is a process and we will keep you informed of things as we go but this is our starting data. We’ll keep you posted if anything changes and we ask you to do the same.

2. Expectations: let’s keep in touch. If either of us get any information that doesn’t fit these expectations let’s let each other know. We’ve got some tricks backstage, Ingrid is an absolute ninja and we’ll see what we can do if they behave badly. We are being burned for what the insurance company did to them.

3. Response to a review about insurance: First of all that you’ve taken a chance to come see us and you had such a good experience that you came back makes me feel good about the work we do and the work that we are responsible for but for those out there that are reading this insurance companies do this to us ALL THE TIME. If you’re reading this they’ve done it to you too, somewhere along the line. My team and I continue to work on this case of one more empty promise from a large insurance company that said they’d pay for something that they now won’t. Thanks for giving us a chance to do what we do best, your dental work. We’re sorry that this happened.

# Out-Of-Network Q & A

Q: Will I still be able to be treated in your office as a patient?

A: Yes! Although we are not a preferred provider with your insurance provider you can absolutely use your insurance in our practice. We are very insurance friendly and will continue to provide you with the support you've come to expect from us with respect to handling claims. For any treatment needs that you may have, our financial coordinators will help you utilize your dental benefits to their fullest.

Q: Will it cost me more to come to your office once I move to out-of-network status?
---
# Frequently Asked Questions

# Q: Are my benefits going to change?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: How do I find out what my benefits are when seeing an out-of-network provider?

A: You can contact your insurance company by phone or go to their website to review your plan coverage for an out-of-network provider.

# Q: Do I have to do anything differently?

A: Not at all. We will continue to treat you in our office and process your claims like we always have. With respect to any treatment needs that you may have, our financial coordinators will help you utilize your dental benefits to their fullest.

# Q: If I am unable to switch my plan and want to continue care in your practice, what options do I have?

A: We would love to still have you come to our office for your dental care. We are very insurance friendly and will continue to provide you with the support you've come to expect from us with respect to handling claims for your provider.

If you have the ability to choose a dental option we recommend our comprehensive in-office Dental Savings Plan (DSP). Our program allows you to have all of your basic check-ups and cleaning services for the year for one low price. All other dental needs receive a 15% discount.

# Q: Are you in network with my insurance? (NEW PATIENT CALL)

A: "Let me be the first to welcome you to our practice. It is a pleasure to meet you by phone and I look forward to meeting you in person here real soon. Although we are not contracted with your insurance company directly we work with many patients who come to see us with your same insurance plan. We have a team dedicated to insurance who will help you use your benefits to their fullest each year.

# Doctor/Patient OON Conversation

"Steve, I wanted to take a minute to give you some information about some important things that are happening in the practice this year. We have done a lot of research over the past few years and have made the very difficult decision to relinquish our preferred provider status with your dental insurance company starting (date).

Every one of our patients is extremely important to us, you are extremely important to us, which is why I wanted to have this conversation with you personally. Working with (Ins Company
---
Name) has been extremely time consuming, more restrictive, and more expensive for our patients. We simply cannot offer the quality of care that we insist on by remaining in your plan's network and we will never compromise the quality of your dental care.

The good news is that you can continue to come to our office. We have set things up to still estimate and submit claims to your carrier on your behalf just as we always have. Your day-to-day visits will be the same and we will continue to do everything we can to help you maximize your insurance benefits each year should you choose to stay with your same carrier.

I also want to make you aware of our cost-effective in-office Dental Savings Program (DSP). If you would like to change your dental plan or ever find yourself without dental insurance we would love to have you in our program. We are sending a few pieces of information home with you today that provide some further information. I encourage you to read through them when you have time.

What questions do you have?

Q: Will it cost me more to come to the office?

A: Honestly, we don't know. It is entirely possible that it will cost you a little bit more. With some plans there is virtually no change for you the patient. Either way, we hope that you will appreciate the relationship we have built over time, the quality of the dentistry performed here, the approach to care where we would never recommend something that is not in your best interest, and the individual attention with personal touches. We hope that those things are reason enough to continue to allow us to care for your dental needs.

# Team Hires

- Have one member from each department use the same form and interview the candidate
- Use entire team to hire candidate
- This creates team unity and allows them to take ownership of the hire

# At the end of a skills assessment interview:

- Invite the candidate in for a meeting at the end of the day
- Ask them how they felt it went
- This gives you vital clues to know if you should offer the position or not
- Pay them that day—usually via check
- If you like them and the team likes them, I strongly recommend making an offer that day. If they exceeded expectations, offer the pay they are looking for so you actually get them
- If you don’t like them—how to politely decline them:
- Thank them for the interview
- Pay them
- Let them know you are interviewing candidates and if they are selected, you will contact them

# ABC Dental Meal Periods and Rest Breaks

# Meal Periods

Employees shall be entitled to an uninterrupted and duty-free meal period of at least a 30-minute duration when the shift exceeds five consecutive hours of work. Such meal periods, to the extent practical, shall be at least one hour after the start, and one hour before the end, of the shift. Employees must be completely relieved of all duties and permitted to pursue personal activities for a period to qualify as non-work, uncompensated time. When the nature of the business activity or other circumstances make an uninterrupted meal period impractical, the employee shall be permitted to consume an on-duty meal while performing duties. Employees shall be permitted to fully consume a meal of choice on the job and be fully compensated for the on-duty meal period without any loss of time or compensation.

At ABC Dental the nature of the business can make uninterrupted meal periods impractical at most times. ABC Dental does not require employees to clock in and out for meal periods unless the employee will be leaving the premises to assume personal tasks and be completely relieved of their duties during this time. This meal period benefit is effective on the employee’s date of hire.

# Deductions For Employer Provided Meals/Gifts

As a benefit effective on date of hire ABC Dental will periodically provide paid meals, team parties and gifts. The reasonable cost or fair market value of meals/gifts provided to the employee, may be used as part of the minimum hourly wage. No profits to the employer may be included in the reasonable cost or fair market value of such meals/gifts furnished. Employee acceptance of a meal/gift must be voluntary and uncoerced.

# Rest Periods

ABC Dental shall authorize and permit a compensated 10-minute rest period for each 4 hours of work, or major fractions thereof, for all employees, as follows:

|Work Hours|Rest Periods Required|
|---|---|
|2 or fewer|0|
|Over 2, and up to 6|1|

# Job Accommodation Process

You have either informed us or we have observed that you are having difficulty carrying out your job duties due to a disability or medical condition. Our policy is to work with employees with disabilities to determine if there is any reasonable change in the work environment or the way things are normally done that would enable them to perform their job duties or to enjoy equal benefits of employment.

To be eligible for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) we must employ at least 15 employees, and you must (1) be able to perform the essential functions of your position with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (2) have a physical or mental disability or medical condition that limits one or more major life activities, have a history of such a condition, or be regarded by others as having such a condition.

If you qualify for a reasonable accommodation, we will engage in a timely, good-faith interactive process to determine if an effective reasonable accommodation can be made that does not create an undue burden on the company. You may be required to provide reasonable medical documentation confirming your need for accommodation, though you are not required to tell us the underlying cause of the disability.

In order to process your request, please complete this form to the best of your ability. Attach additional sheets as necessary.

# FAVORITE THINGS

# OnBoarding Email

Email sent to employee the week or two prior to starting:

Hello!

We are glad you’ve decided to join the EXAMPLE Dental team! We have an amazing team dedicated to creating a better dental experience, and we hope that you can get up to speed with our systems so that you feel comfortable from the first day.

You should have received an email from our payroll service ‘Gusto’- which will allow you to accept the job offer, as well as put in all your personal information. It’s all done digitally now, so make sure to find that email in case it might have gone to your spam folder. (Remember on your first day to also bring 2 forms of ID as well- Drivers License, Social Security Card, or Passport.)
---
So first things first, we run on a set of core values that are the most important rules that we live by in the practice. We also have a mission and vision for where these rules will take us as we grow. Read this Mission, Vision, Core Values document, there may be a test- so memorizing these is a good idea!

To get a general sense of how we run as an office and how to do a few things around the office, we created a ‘Universal On-Boarding’ document. Read that HERE.

With any job, there’s usually a legalese manual. It’s boring and filled with a bunch of policies, however it does cover a lot of what it means to be a good employee with our company. So grab a coffee and read that HERE.

For your position as a Dental Assistant, there’s a few documents that outline exactly what you will be doing as well as a few videos that will help you understand Open Dental better. Read and watch those below:

- Job Description for Dental Assistant
- Clinical Setups
- OD Video Overview
- OD Clinical Videos
- Clinical 1- Entering Tx
- Clinical 2- Clinical Notes
- If you have any certifications for your degree or skills, like radiology or coronal polishing, please bring a copy of that on your first day as well.

All our doctors and hygienists run by a general set of guidelines set up by our Doctors. We tried to codify these diagnoses and treatments as much as possible. It’s a huge book, and is really just a primer on what and how to do things. It’s not required reading but if you ever want to flip through it, you can read it HERE.

Overall we run a different sort of practice. It’s based on the first core value of ‘Fantastic Guest Experience’. All the systems listed above create a guest experience that is relaxing, well-timed, and smooth. We want every player on the team to be an All-star, and we feel these systems get us there.

If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us, Dr. XXXX at (###) ###-#### or Dr. XXXX at (###) ###-####.

Thank you again, we look forward to starting this adventure with you! Example Dental Team

- Edification- whenever possible
- Quickly make them feel welcome, part of the family, involved & a part of our office culture
- Sit down & get to know them
- Don’t forget they are working in a new environment- it’s like working in someone else’s kitchen - it’s up to you to help them get comfortable
- Load up with NP & existing patient exams for them early on - to help w/ RAMP UP
- Senior doctor send Fillings & smaller Tx plans their way
- Give them heads ups about patients in huddle

- Role play treatment planning
- Role play handoffs NDTR
---
- Review the Audit protocol with them
- Review their case presentations with them
- Review the CA/RS protocol

# Hygienist

- Hygienists must at the beginning of the appointment mention the doctor the patient is seeing so it’s not a surprise at the end “I’m so excited you get to meet Dr. New Guy/Gal today, he/she is such a great person, really really good dentist we’re super lucky to have them”
- Role Play hygiene exam flow
- Prep them for opportunities for treatment on existing patients
- Calibration meetings
- Co-Diagnose (exam sheets fully filled out)
- Get patients numb for them

# Assistants

- Edify the doctor while you are doing a workup or getting the patient situated
- Have everything ready to go for them
- Take great photos & have good diagnostic X-rays
- Error on the side of more photos & X-rays (PAs Pano CBCT)

- We won’t change systems for them but get familiar if they need certain instruments out or do things a certain way or get them familiar with our setups
- Put them with more experienced assistants
- Help them with the office flow
- Ask them for training on technical dental stuff (i.e. fillings, crowns, temps, dentures)
- They can Sit in on training w/ the assistants
- Give them assistant onboarding documents
- Teach them how to flip rooms / sterilization / lab work

# Hygiene and Doctor Co-Discovery/Edification Tips

Edification - The instruction or improvement of a person morally or intellectually. To uplift or speak highly of someone.

# Hygiene:

- Completely fill out laminated Exam sheet
- For existing patients look at previous exam sheets for watches or outstanding treatment
- Take Intraoral photos on EVERYONE even if not due for X-Rays or teeth are “Perfect”
- Educate, talk about some sort of treatment
---
# What you can talk about…

- SRP, Laser, Fluoride, Fillings (Class 1 or Class 2), Failing Amalgams, Crowns, Night Guards, Missing teeth (Bridges or implants), Whitening, Invisalign and Cosmetic Dentistry
- Edify the Doctors for success - CREATE URGENCY
- Verbiage “I’m concerned about.. I want to have the Doctor take a look at this.. ETC”

# Doctors:

We are responsible for the results we create which means, we are responsible for the opportunities that we create for ourselves.

Be Prepared, Be Proactive and Be Consistent

# Before Huddle -

- Split up Doctor Exams
- Review patients previous X-Rays, Exam Sheets and outstanding treatment
- Bring an Impact Item on an existing patient to huddle
- Take good IO’s - Seeing is Believing
- Verbiage “Dr. G/I was previously watching or previously recommended” “I agree with the hygienist…” If you disagree with the hygienist still acknowledge what they recommended, say “I think it can wait”
- Flow of the Exam - Ask the Hygienist questions in front of the patient, for example: “So Michelle how’s everything looking?.. Michelle, is there anything you want me to be aware of that caught your eye?” Hygienist speaks, then thank the hygienist for the nice summary. After this you can open up the conversation with the patient by asking “What kind of questions do you have for me?”
- Do your EOD sheets and KPI’s (Set goals for yourself)
- Strive for same day treatment but always make sure to check with the DA’s before promising anything to the patient (do this before you start your exam if you think it might be an opportunity for a same day start)
- Edify your treatment coordinator, say things like “This is Megan, she’s going to help us make sense of everything we talk about today from a financial perspective.. ETC” This will build trust between your patient and TC which in return will build better trust with your patient and you
- Capitalize on Recall patients too.. Patients with seemingly “perfect teeth” you can always recommend Night Guard, Invisalign, small Class 1 fillings and bring up watches if you see them

# Audits -

Front office to do the audits for 3 and 9 weeks follow ups, regardless of this you will want to track and follow up with certain patients on your own like any big cases you have treatment planned. Doing this will allow you to own parts of your schedule and build further trust with your patients, making them more eager to get treatment done.
---
# Video Onboarding Checklist

Sometimes there is a higher level of detail that is needed to pass along information about your office. In that case, maybe it is easier to make videos and host those videos for your office and on-boarding. Below is an example chart that Dr. Owner had made for his office. After each employee watched each video, they would initial the chart. After showing the Doctor or lead assistant they were proficient, then their leader would also initial that box. This is not a comprehensive list, it is just a sample size to give you an idea of how to build your own video vault for team training (we have a more comprehensive list in The Complete Dental Assistant Manual). We recommend using the youtube page linked to your practice gmail account to upload videos as “Not Public” and hyperlink the links to those videos inside various written systems that they apply to as well as creating a complete video vault checklist like below. In the past we would say to new hires “go ahead and watch the training videos on youtube.” What we found was they would watch a couple, but because the searchability is a bit difficult and because we were not crystal clear on the expectations they ended up missing a ton of videos. By having a checklist that gets signed off on, we now know they are getting the education that we expect.

# Skills Acquisition Onboarding Checklist

The Following is an example for a dental assistant, but we recommend making a chart like this for every position in the dental office.

For every type of procedure or skill that an assistant might need to become proficient with we created a spreadsheet for “check-offs”. In the past I would ask an assistant “Hey how many times have you made a temporary crown?” and they would respond “Oh yeah I’ve made a few”. Then I would say “a few like 2 or a few like 15?”. They never quite seemed to know, and this was across the board for a variety of procedures. So we leveled up and decided we wanted them to check off a certain number of times performing, or assisting on each procedure before moving on to the next. So for example, we want them to view over the shoulder assisting on 3 crowns, then assist on 3 crowns themself with a senior assistant helping them, then make 5 temps on typodonts before making temps on a patient and so on and so forth. The following is a small sample size, for the purposes of this book we have not printed the whole list.

# HR

# Employee Handbook

# Termination Steps

# Benefits

# Time Clock

# Payroll

We run payroll 2 times per month for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons is to avoid 3 payroll months, which tend to throw off overhead and budgeting. Team members are paid on the 15th and 30/31st of the month and the pay periods are based on hours accrued from the 26th -10th of the month & the 11th -25th of the month. This allows the office manager to run payroll on the 26th and 11th of each month with enough buffer for 3 days weekends, bank holidays etc so that the money always hits team members accounts on the 15th and 30/31st. This is critical, if you mess with team members paychecks or miss pay dates, you will lose team members and it will negatively impact the culture. If there is ever an unprecedented circumstance, outside of your control, that would lead to payroll not hitting the date the team expects, inform them immediately. Weird things can happen with banks or payroll providers. We do prefer Gusto for its ease of use and price point.

# Group Health Insurance Protocol

Note: this is old and will be specific to your state and insurance plan, however, we recommend you have a written system for the health insurance process. All highlighted below is specific to the group
---
# Group Health Ins. Protocol (old)

# Requirements

- The employee must be working full time (minimum of 32 hours) to qualify for a group benefit plan
- The employee must be working 60 days at the office to qualify for a group benefit plan
- Search “benefits guide 2023” in google drive to view all benefit plans

# Next steps

- Ask employees whether or not they wish to participate in the group plan at 60-day check-in
- IF EMPLOYEE DOES NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE: have them only fill out the first two pages of the application and scan documents to the benefits advisor (Adeila/Tim), after, put the documents in the health insurance folder with the “opt-out” stack
- IF EMPLOYEE DOES WANT TO PARTICIPATE: Have employee read benefit book and select an insurance plan and fill out application HERE
- Explain that the practice will provide $150 towards employee insurance plan
- Have employees fill out Pretax Salary Reduction Agreement so they understand that funds are taken out of their bank account to pay for the remaining amount of the insurance plan each month, then put it in the health insurance folder in office with the rest of the agreements
- Have the employee fill out paperwork and scan documents to benefits advisors and wait for the response on appropriate deduction amount to add to employees payroll, be sure to staple the documents and put it in the health insurance folder with the “opt-in” stack
- Once the benefits advisor responds, write down the employee contribution in the health insurance folder along with what plan they chose on this document “group insurance plan participation” (print again if the page is filled in the insurance binder)
- Have employee fill out COBRA Document -group plan
- Add employee benefits to Gusto. This includes adding the employee contribution and GDC’s portion

# How to add benefits to payroll:

1. Log into Gusto through company login (authorized personnel only)
2. On the left-hand side of Gusto’s website click the “Benefits” tab
3. Scroll down until you see “Payroll Deductions”
4. Under that, click “BCBS Insurance”
5. A list of employees actively using the group insurance plan should pop up
6. Scroll down and click “add employees to benefit”
7. Select appropriate employee
8. Under “employee deduction per pay period” you put the number given from the benefits advisor for the proper deduction amount (may vary in amount because of)
---
1. Under “company contribution per pay period” put 150.00 (this is the amount our practice is contributing to the insurance plan) YOU PUT ½ THE AMOUNT SINCE PAYROLL IS RAN TWICE so $75 is what Practice is contributing each paycheck
2. Lastly, click save and double-check to make sure the amounts for both deductions and contributions are correct before logging out of gusto

After the plan is selected and approved by the benefit advisor

- Go to https://employer.anthem.com/
- Login to employer account (authorized personnel only)
- On the main dashboard, scroll down until you get to “Find ID cards & manage employees”
- Select “Search By Name” and type in new employee name
- Their member details should pop up and click “view/print ID card”
- Click the “email” button above the card and send employee card so they can temporarily use it until the physical card comes in the mail
- The insurance card should come in within about 1-2 weeks

# COBRA FAQ

- Our office is required to provide COBRA if we have 20+ employees
- You DON’T need to offer COBRA when:
- Part-time employees (under 32 hours)
- Not yet qualified (employment under 60 days)
- Declined to participate in the group plan
- Events that TRIGGER COBRA:
- An employee quits OR gets fired (unless it is for gross misconduct, be sure to discuss with CEDR to see what would qualify as “gross misconduct”)
- Reduction in employee’s hours (i.e.: full-time employee dropping to part-time)
- A covered spouse’s divorce/legal separation from an employee
---
# COBRA Administration

- Employee death
- An employee’s entitlement to medicare
- A covered dependent’s change in status (Ex: reaching an age that no longer qualifies the dependent for coverage under parent’s health plan)
- Active military duty when you don’t voluntarily maintain health coverage
- Failure to return to work at the end of family and medical leave where coverage was in effect at the beginning of the leave but was lost during the leave
- Business’s bankruptcy

# How long does COBRA last?

- Depending on the type of event and who the beneficiary is, coverage could continue for 18-36 months after the date of the event or the coverage loss
- In the case of termination of employment or reduction in hours - 18 months for the employee and any covered dependents
- In the case of qualifying events for reasons other than termination/reduction of hours - 36 months of coverage

# What does the employer pay for COBRA?

- The administrator is allowed to charge the terminated employee for the full cost to the employer of the monthly coverage plus a 2% admin fee (could be around $400-$700)

# COBRA Document

COBRA Document - group plan.docx - Print this for anyone wanting to continue coverage after they have left the practice and was participating in our health insurance plan

# Steps for administering COBRA Upon Termination:

- Double check that employee that was leaving or terminated paid for both portions of their contribution that month for BOTH pay periods.
- 1. Provide the employee and/or his or her qualified beneficiaries (dependents) with the “COBRA Document” (see above), customized for the specific employee within 14 days of the termination
- 2. Notify the health plan directly and/or your broker, Sage Benefit Advisors, or your third party administrator (Adeila) of the qualifying event as soon as possible. (Colorado insurance carriers cannot retro-terminate coverage)
- 3. Track when the COBRA election is due — the employee has 60 days to elect or decline COBRA coverage.
- 4. If COBRA is NOT elected within 60 days, file the information in the appropriate internal files.
- 5. If COBRA IS elected, collect payment for the first month’s coverage within 45 days of the COBRA election (CHECK MUST BE MAILED TO GREEN DENTAL CARE)
- 6. After the first month, if COBRA payments are late, provide the qualified beneficiary with the appropriate 30 day grace period, and provide a notice of early termination of COBRA coverage.
- 7. If payment is not received after the 30 day grace period, provide a notice of early termination of COBRA coverage.
---
1. If late or “short” payment is received, notify the qualified beneficiary in writing and follow steps 6 and 7, if appropriate.
2. Track when COBRA is scheduled to be exhausted (can range from 18 to 36 months depending on termination reason).
3. Offer conversion options to the qualified beneficiary 180 days before COBRA is exhausted, if applicable.
4. If a second qualifying event occurs during the COBRA period, extend COBRA rights appropriately with the carrier and notify the qualified beneficiary.

# Associate Payroll

Run daily production report in Open Dental

1. Click reports
2. Standard
3. More options under Production and Income category
4. Select your name as provider
5. Check box- “Use initial claim date for write-off estimates, ins pay date for write-off adjustments
6. OK

Associate payroll may depend on your practice management software, your contract and your philosophy. We pay dentists on 30% of collections, they pay ½ their lab bill and we deduct care credit fees. Since they are W2 employees we pay them every 2 weeks with the rest of the team. Doctors are to check and print their production day sheets at the end of the day and manually add $35 for any dental savings plan exams (this is what we allocate for the opportunity to discover treatment on a DSP patient), then the doctor enters that days total adjusted production on the date. At the end of the pay period the doctor will go back and run the production report for each day to make sure it still matches and then turn in their payroll to the office manager, the office manager will double check their work. Lab bills are accounted for on 1 payroll a month.

# Treating Provider Protocol

# Beginning of Day

Prior to huddle, providers will look at the schedule together and make a plan of which hygiene exams they will do that day.

The list of patients per provider will be shared with OM so that the correct provider can be assigned to the visits.

If only one provider is working at a time, they will be the default provider for exams.

If a hygiene visit does not include an exam, the patient’s primary provider may be left as the treating provider.

# During the Day

When a patient is seen for an exam, the hygienist will find the provider who has been assigned to the visit.

In the case that the provider is changed at time of service:

- Hygienist will change the provider assigned to the visit in Open Dental.
- Hygienist/Treatment Coordinator always circles the correct provider’s name at the top of the exam sheet!
- Dentists will also double check that they are appropriately assigned to any exams they do.

Once the visit is finished, before setting services as complete, hygienists will double check that the correct treating provider has been assigned to each service and the visit overall. This includes the exam, as well as x-rays and fluoride - which may be assigned to either the dentist or the hygienist depending on who performed these tasks.

Before submitting the claim, the hygienist or front office will ensure that the treating provider has been assigned.

# End of Day

Dentists will review their production for the day and ensure that they were assigned to the correct patients.

Dentists will assign themselves as the “Primary Provider” in the New Patient’s charts or if they treatment planned new services for an existing patient which they will perform. This will make it so that future visits will default with them as the treating provider.

Note: this comes up at every dental office with multiple doctors, the “MY PATIENT” mindset. You might be tempted to ask, What does that mean? They are all OUR PATIENTS, the practice’s patients.
---
If your treatment plan works, we will always try to get that Tx scheduled with you. After 6 months, if another doc sees the patient for a recall exam and closes the Tx, then that is what it is. We will all have many instances where we are on either side of this equation. If you can’t get on board with this, then maybe group practice dentistry is not for you. With that said, for cosmetic cases and Invisalign cases, if you are diligent and remind the team to tag you to those patients with dummy codes that will be treated differently, we don’t have hard and fast rules on this though. My advice, if you’re concerned, is to do a better job creating urgency, speaking to patients, and not confusing patients, so that you can close and get case acceptances. With all of that said, patients sometimes are not ready; we cannot determine if the patient had a big financial burden at that time, and at the recall appointment, they were ready to hear and do the treatment. This is the real world, and that’s sometimes just how it works.

# DSP Production Allocation

- Dental Savings Plan production allocation will be based on the discounted rate for a family of 4. DSP patients are cash patients that allow us to get reimbursed at a much higher rate than insurance patients, so take good care of them and make them long-term loyal patrons of our practice.
- Most procedures and adjustments for DSP members are a straight 15% discount and very straightforward for calculating your production accurately. This document is intended for allocating production for services provided that are included in the $365/yr membership fee.
- Exams, Regular Cleanings (including up to 2 perio maintenance), X-rays, and Fluoride are included in the plan and therefore not a straight 15% adjustment.
- There is no easy way to split this up; we believe this is more than fair. The difference in production and DSP fee goes toward management of the plan and marketing expenses to acquire more NP to the practice.

# Dentist Production

- No production for Limited Exams, Emergency Exams, Additional X-rays needed at emergency appointments (or other complimentary/included DSP services as per the DSP brochure).
- $500 OFF Invisalign
- $4,000 Implant start to finish
- When a patient comes in for Initial Comp Exam or Periodic Exams (2 per year per patient), you will ADD $35 towards your production for that day and have signed off by Office Manager.

# Hygienist Production

- For each recall, you ADD $100 to your end of day production report and have signed by Office Manager, whether or not you took X-rays that day. This is based on the law of averages; sometimes you will take an FMX, sometimes no X-rays, sometimes just bite wings...we will base your production at $100 for every DSP member recall.
- Remember DSP covers 2 cleanings per year, so the production above is for the 2 times per year that the patient has an exam with a dentist.
---
For example if you have a perio maintenance patient that comes 4 times per year, 2 of their cleanings are covered with DSP and the other 2 they will pay 15% off of our UCR fee for Perio Maintenance which will go towards your production normally.

$200 NP special

Allocate $52 to Doctor Production and $144 to Hygiene production

# Dealing with Treatment plan modifications

Or

If a different doctor treatment planned and you are seeing something different

If you need to add a surface on a filling mid treatment inform the patient “it looks like this filling was a little larger than the X-ray led us to believe, but we won’t charge you extra for that” - add the surface in Open Dental and bill to insurance, but don’t charge patient the difference - make a note -

Do not charge patient for extra surface added during procedure

If you discover a cavity that was NOT previously treatment planned on an adjacent tooth after prepping - stop, take a photo, inform the patient, ask them if they want to take care of it right then and there since they’re already numb- if you want we can find out what the extra out of pocket will be (9 x out of 10 they will say “it’s fine we have to get it done anyways)- tell the front office, typically no need to stop entire procedure and sign a new treatment plan or consent (verbal consent is fine)

# Protocol for When Other Doctor’s Work Needs to be Redone / Is Failing

# Filling or Crown

- Before saying something needs to be redone check the notes, chart, prior x-rays and familiarize with the situation - there’s always a chance it met expectations / expected longevity
- Explain the clinical situation and the reason for needing to redo something.
- Support/back up the Dr that did the work
- Dentistry, like all of medicine, is an imperfect science; complications arise
- “I have seen countless examples of Dr. X’s work doing this very same procedure and I stand by his work 100% of the time, this is an exception and not the norm. He performs this procedure at an extremely high, elite level.”
- We work together as part of a group practice because we believe in each other’s abilities and skills and stand by each other’s treatment
- Come up with a possible reason for the failure/need for re-do without making the Dr look bad.
- Reassure the patient that we will take care of them and we warranty all of our work
- Encourage the patient to schedule with the Dr that did the original treatment
- “Dr. X really knows this clinical situation well, he is really the one that is best qualified to complete the care.”
- Schedule the patient with a corresponding “Renew” code in Open Dental and re-iterate that 100% of the original fee for the procedure will be covered by our office.
---
If you are getting the patient to do other work on them, downplay the remake to the patient and make the other doctor aware and redo the treatment for the doctor while you’re doing the other new work on the patient.

Make a clinical judgement as to the urgency and if it can wait consider waiting and if waiting have the recall with the doctor that did the original work.

# Failing Endo Protocol

Mitigate patient expectations by saying, “It’s not real obvious what’s going on here- root canal-treated teeth can flare up from time to time. I want to check with Dr. X (whoever did the RCT) because they’re much more familiar with this particular tooth and in the meantime let’s adjust your bite and get you on antibiotics. Often a root canal-treated tooth needs the help of additional systemic antibiotics later on to completely knock down the infection.”

- Adjust bite and prescribe antibiotics
- Tell the Dr who performed the RCT and they will decide how to proceed
- Monitor, Retreat, extract, or refer to endodontist

# Needle Stick/Exposure Protocol

Any great assistant will hopefully not ever get stuck with a needle. However, sometimes random things happen and any number of employees in the office have had this occur. When it does, the question inevitably arises- What should I do if I get a needle stick or exposure at work?

# Protocol

- Wash needlesticks and cuts with soap and water right away, Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water for 5 mins. Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants for 5 mins.
- Report the incident to your supervisor as soon as possible.
- Call Company Care (or your local urgent care clinic) and notify that the staff member is coming for exposure.
- Document the incident at work with time of exposure and if possible leave for labs as soon as possible.
- Notify the source that they will be required to also go in for blood work with the following information for Company Care as well.
- If the source is under IV sedation or if the patient wanted to do PRD drawl we could take the source blood into company care with the exposed patient.
- Staff members should have the Source patients' information ready to go for the exposed patient to take into Company Care (or local Quick Care Clinic that might specialize in workplace injuries).

Hello Valued Patient,

This is a friendly reminder....

It's hard to believe, but the end of 2018 is fast approaching and soon people will be scrambling to get in to our dental office to use their valuable insurance benefits before the end of the year.

Remember most dental insurance and flex spending plans if not used by December 31st disappear forever (this is often a loss of $1,000-2,000 in benefits you have already paid for).

# Fixed Expenses:

Are relatively stable month to month, regardless of patient volume or services provided

# Variable Expenses:

Fluctuate depending on the number of patients seen, types of procedures provided, or other practice needs.
---
The following are SOME examples of fixed vs. variable expenses. When tackling an overhead problem, we typically first start with analyzing Lab and Dental / Office Supply costs and the processes involved in supply ordering.

# Fixed Expenses

- Facility / Rent
- Payroll
- Insurance
- Some Utilities - electricity, internet
- Phones
- Loans
- Software Subscriptions
- Property Taxes
- Memberships or Licensing fees

# Variable Expenses

- Dental Supplies
- Lab
- Office Supplies
- Marketing / Advertising
- Some Utilities - water
- Patient Consumables
- Merchant Processing
- Legal

We like to utilize a spreadsheet like this for reference of all of the companies we contract with or have subscriptions with. It’s a nice quick glance when we look for opportunities to cut costs, negotiate, or remove a service or subscription that is no longer serving us. It’s a useful reference to check on 3-4 times a year when you analyze overhead costs.

Poorly aligned teeth can create abnormal lateral forces and stress on surrounding enamel rods and periodontal structures which can lead to abfractions.

# Abfractions

Abnormal Lateral Contact Point

|Abfraction|Abnormal Lateral Forces|Normalized Forces|

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# TRADITIONAL DENTURES

Traditional dentures have been around for a long time. Unfortunately, this restorative option can make it difficult to eat. Since dental implants have become so popular, dentures are now considered below standard care. Those who use traditional dentures have seen a huge loss of gum and bone support in their mouth. This leads to premature aging, facial drooping, and sagging.

# ADVANTAGES

- Least Expensive Option
- Can Improve Aesthetics
- Better Than Nothing At All

# DISADVANTAGES

- Hard to Eat With
- Not Secure
- Feels Bulky
- Loss of Taste; Temperature Sensations
- Must be Relined & Repaired
- Causes Bone Loss Over Time

# GREEN DENTAL

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# IMPLANT SNAP-ON DENTURES

Implant snap-on dentures have become a popular solution to replacing missing teeth. Patients love this option because the denture snaps into place; unlike traditional dentures, implant snap-on dentures are more secure and less bulky. Additionally, they don't cover the roof of the mouth. The denture can be easily removed for cleaning. With this option, patients prevent further bone loss, premature aging, and facial sagging.

# ADVANTAGES

- Most Affordable Implant Option
- Better Than Traditional Dentures
- Prevents Bone Loss & Premature Aging
- Improves Ability to Taste

# DISADVANTAGES

- There Is Some Movement
- Comes Out At Night

# PERFORMANCE

# OPTIONS FOR REPLACING TEETH

# IMPLANT-SUPPORTED PERMANENT TEETH

Implant-supported teeth include a screwed-in dental bridge. A full set of upper or lower teeth are permanently attached to the dental implants; which gives patients the look, feel, and function of natural teeth. The bridge can only be removed by the dentist once per year. Implant-supported bridges are the most natural solutions available.

# ADVANTAGES

- Strong & Reliable Material
- Looks & Feels Natural
- Restores Biting & Chewing Function
- Long-Term Solution
- Prevents Bone Loss & Premature Aging

# DISADVANTAGES

- May Be Difficult to Clean
- Requires Maintenance Over Time
- Treatment is Costly

# FOR PATIENTS THAT HAVE ALOT OF SENSITIVITY To TEMPERATURE (MOSTLY COLD)

GLUMA Desensitizer achieves its effects by precipitation of plasma proteins, which reduces dentinal permeability and occludes the peripheral dentinal tubules. This inhibits the flow of fluid through the tubules which is the cause of sensitivity.

Apply the minimum amount of GLUMA Desensitizer required to the dentine surface to be treated by using an applicator tip, brush or similar. Gently massage in for approx. 30 to 60 seconds. Then dry the surface carefully in an air stream until the liquid film has disappeared and the surface is no longer shiny.

Tip: It can take up to a couple of hours until the optimum desensitizing effect is achieved. If a single application of GLUMA Desensitizer does not produce sufficient and sustained pain relief, the treatment can be repeated at the same or subsequent appointment before alternative treatments are used.
