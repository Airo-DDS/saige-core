# Chapter 1

# A TALE OF TWO DENTISTS

Craig Spodak thought he had arrived. A third-generation managing four-room office with its thirty-inch tube television and dust-covered ceiling fan—and transformed it into an architectural marvel. Thirteen thousand square feet of floor-to-ceiling glass and equipped with all the latest technology.

But now, standing in the newly completed building he had envisioned for years he felt hollow. In his attempts to make his mark on dentistry he had spent way more than he anticipated. He wasn’t sure how he would fill this practice with enough patients to pay his bills. With a young family at home and a mortgage payment looming, Craig felt suffocated with doubt.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

He had wanted to honor and advance his family's legacy, to build something greater than himself. Instead, he was fairly sure he was going to run into the ground. He felt as if he'd jumped out of a plane and now had to build the parachute during freefall.

Ask anyone who's achieved any level of success in their industry and they’ll likely describe a similar moment—a time when their faith was shaken; when they weren't sure they could accomplish what they set out to do, and when fear clinched every bone in their body.

But the beauty of failure, whether real or perceived, is that it facilitates growth and greater understanding. With the support of his father—the man whose legacy he wanted to uphold—and the gracious help of the bank, which briefly postponed his mortgage payments, Craig tapped into his mission, vision, and passion to pull through. He didn't give into his fears, but used them as fuel. He chose to reevaluate and reengineer his plan. The experience gave him the insight and perspective necessary to build a sustainable business and do justice to the legacy he wanted so much to sustain.

Today, he is living his dream. A steady stream of happy patients fills the hallways daily. It's been many years and a lot of hard work from the day he sat in tears and wondered if he was done for. Along the way, through many ups and downs, Craig learned what it means to build a bulletproof practice.

to provide the best possible care for his patients, promote a culture that enables his team to thrive, build superior marketing and systems that drive patients in the door; and finally, to leave room for the constant evolution inherent in running a successful business:

Perhaps you're interested in starting your own practice or in taking an existing one to the next level. Maybe you're just unnerved by dentistry's rapidly changing landscape and you want to know how to adapt to—and thrive in—the new ecosystem:

If you haven't yet found what you're looking for—discovering only business books that fell flat or resources that don't seem relevant to your specific needs—you’re not alone. As dentists, we don’t want to take advice from business experts; we want to hear it from other dentists:

We know because we’ve been there. As practice owners with very different operational models, we’ve struggled with the same issues in working to bulletproof our own businesses and find fulfillment:

Dr. Craig Spodak is the owner of Spodak Dental, a thirteen-thousand-square-foot, one-stop shop that looks more like an Apple Store than a dentist's office, with multiple practitioners under one roof.

Dr. Peter Boulden owns Atlanta Dental Spa, a multiple-location practice that conveniently serves Atlanta's widespread.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

population with an experience level that rivals that of any elite spa.

To our knowledge, a duo with the scope of experience and industry knowledge that we collectively possess does not exist:

While we’ve worked hard to establish and grow our businesses, we have received a lot of help along the way. It's time to pay it forward. This book is a way to upload the vital information we’ve amassed over the years and share it with you:

Whether you're looking to start something new, engage in a major overhaul, or just strengthen an already solid foundation, we’ll help you define your own definition of "bulletproof" and bring your vision to life.

We’ll give you the tools to design or tune up your marketing and social media, build and lead your dream team, find financial freedom—all on your terms. It's your vision, after all.

Let's start with some of the issues we see most frequently:

Through our podcast, Bulletproof Dental Practice, we have had the opportunity to share our insights on how to build a better practice and connect with practitioners from across the country. Every day, we get emails from dentists looking for business answers, but unwilling to admit they’re in business in the first place. This is their first mistake.
---
# A TALE OF TWO DENTISTS

Often, their next mistake is turning their energy and attention elsewhere. Seeking financial security and unable to see the unique value proposition that dentistry provides, they use any extra cash they might bring in to purchase a sandwich shop or an ice cream store. They enter businesses they know nothing about while neglecting the vast potential of their own practices.

We want to point out the remarkable opportunity in front of you and encourage you to reinvest in your practice rather than putting time and money into something else. We believe that if you focus on dentistry as a business and identify yourself as a craftsperson and a technician within your own office, your rewards will be tenfold.

# Here are our stories:

# Peter's Story

After graduating from dental school in 2002, Peter began his career as an associate in a well-respected practice known throughout the Southeast. But as time went on, he found there were many things he wanted to do differently: he wanted to create something antithetical to the drab, uncomfortable dental offices he had visited as a child—a practice that inspired confidence and calm rather than dread.

He knew he needed to develop his own concept. When he set out to build a start-up, fee-for-service practice, everyone...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

called him crazy for leaving his security behind - especially since fee-for-service was, and still is, considered a difficult sell. At the time; he had more time than money, and after a full day at the office; he would go home and study business, marketing, and clinical technique to align his practice with his vision.

After ten years of eighteen-hour days, his business, Atlanta Dental Spa, has more momentum than he ever could have anticipated. And Atlanta Dental Spa is still fee-for-service, a concept that has only gotten more difficult since he established the practice in 2005 - which goes to show that drive, commitment, and thoughtful execution can pay dividends, no matter the model.

# Craig's Story

Craig is a third-generation dentist: His father started Spodak Dental in 1976, and Craig joined him in 1998. Back then; his mother answered the phone and logged appointments by hand in a big, hardbound book. Productivity was low, to say the least; if two people called at the same time, she couldn't book them simultaneously.

When Craig got engaged in 2006, he knew he needed to be part of a more productive practice in order to support a family: His father agreed to let him take over; and he began bringing in associates and developing a plan for his current space.
---
# A TALE OF TWO DENTISTS

Craig found that he really enjoyed working with different providers. The level of activity and the ability to surround himself with a likeminded community reminded him of the collegial environment he'd experienced in dental school. Ultimately he decided to build the thirteen-thousand-square-foot, eighteen-operatory facility that houses Spodak Dental today, knowing that no matter the outcome and of the intense challenges he would face along the way, he would be more fulfilled than if he had not taken the steps to express his vision.

# The Evolution of Our Bromance

Our willingness not just to build our dream businesses, but also to stay on the cutting edge of the field, fueled our meeting and subsequent friendship. It started the same way that many of today's great relationships do: online.

Social media can be a highly valuable tool in elevating a practice: Various platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, are great ways to broadcast a high-quality office culture and share every aspect of care offered, from cleanings to complete cosmetic and reconstructive smile enhancement—but more on that later.

In scanning the internet to keep an eye on what was happening in the industry, Peter found Spodak Dental. It was the first time Peter had stumbled upon Craig's feed, and he had been able to rest assured that he was at the head of the dental envy.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

of the pack Everyone else he had come across was at least ten years behind him: Now he knew he had to reach out:

Peter sent Craig a message to let him know how impressive he found Craig's practice. Craig responded in kind; telling Peter that he had actually been following and admiring Peter's work for several years. In fact, Craig had shared Peter's information with the marketing company he was working with as an aspirational example of dentistry done right: He had never reached out to Peter because he thought Peter's practice was essentially out of his league.

For Craig, part of what made Peter's practice so compelling was its retail feel. It spoke to one of the concepts that we both adhere to: that dentistry is not a segment of healthcare: Instead, it has more in common with retail, as everything that is not an extraction is essentially an upsell (we'll touch on this too).

Over the years, our friendship has enhanced our individual businesses and enabled us to push the boundaries of what we believed to be not just possible, but also achievable:

We did it; and so can you. But it will take drive. And, maybe most importantly, it will require a plan that embodies your own vision. We'll help you identify it—and make it bulletproof:

# The Current State of Dentistry

Other dentists tell us all the time that they’re happy with the status quo. They don’t want to check out marketing trends, their computer systems or learn the latest technology; or update. They’re comfortable with what they have. They’re coasting:

But Kodak had coasted. Blockbuster had coasted: There should be no such thing as coasting: When you believe you’re coasting, you’re technically headed downhill because the environment you’re in will continue to evolve.

Let’s take marketing, for example. The world is so saturated with information that it is much harder to make an impact: Even bananas have stickers advertising the Despicable Me franchise on them. People used to hear a particular message seven or eight times before internalizing it: Studies show that today, it takes seventeen to twenty repetitions to have the same effect: One day, the economy may decide that you’re no longer relevant, and it will likely be well before you’re ready to make some changes.

As any businessperson will tell you, you can either work on a business or in a business. The most important work is usually not the most urgent. When someone comes in with a broken tooth, you know you must attend to it; often at the expense of other responsibilities.

But the quiet aspects of your office - the elements that are rarely pressing but could certainly use your attention - are
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

necessary to take your practice to the next level: These include updating your technology, ensuring you have high-quality team members; and building a culture that speaks for itself. These things are just as deserving of your time because they will provide tremendous ROI:

To have a next-level practice, you always have to be thinking, What's next? What's next? What's next? Who could put me out of business? Why are they doing it better than us?

This is especially true in dentistry today: Although solo practices continue to dominate the industry, it is projected that in five years, dentistry will follow in the footsteps of medicine. Multiple-location and corporate-owned practices will compose the majority of the market: The new dentist's office in your local Walmart, alongside the barber shop and nail salon, is a small indication of what's to come. Amazon could easily discover the scale of profitability associated with dentistry and get into the game tomorrow, changing everything:

In addition, corporate values—which often come in the form of numbers—are not necessarily good for the future of the field. With the quotas, production minimums, and corresponding disciplinary actions that coincide with corporate ownership, it's hard to tap into the human experience that is essential to good dentistry:

There are numerous factors that fuel these trends. Dental school graduates face a tremendous debt burden: the average
---
# A TALE OF TWO DENTISTS

dental school student graduates with a staggering $265,000 in student loans as of 2015—though we are hearing much higher numbers from dentists fresh out of school. Patients also expect practices to be on the cutting edge of technology, making it more expensive to open—and maintain—a practice than ever before.

Millennial culture is influencing the latest generation of dentists to shirk practice ownership with the goal of working to live rather than living to work. As the challenges of successful practice ownership continue to mount, things can feel overwhelming.

But we believe that cottage-industry dentistry and doing what's right for the patient will always pay off. Good patient experiences and outcomes are the leading indicators of success, and money will follow.

It will take some work to figure out how you can best serve your patients, but we promise that these problems—and the willingness to tackle them—may actually be the key to more than your business's success. They may be the key to your happiness, life's ultimate bottom line.

# Embracing—and Improving—Your Problems

People often take themselves through the same mental exercise. They think, "If I can get to this point, my problems will go away: When the problems go away then I'll be happy." But in...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

In actuality, studies have shown that happiness is not the destination, but the journey: You're happiest when you're solving problems - that's why you love dentistry on a micro level.

The idea that when you make it in business, everything magically falls into place and problems no longer exist is not just inaccurate, but also not what you want: When people retire, they report lower levels of satisfaction, lower levels of health, and lower levels of fulfillment. Once their problems go away, they no longer have purpose. With only your tee time to worry about; golfing yourself to death becomes a very real possibility.

When you keep powering forward, we can assure you problems will never go away - and that's not a bad thing: What will happen is that the quality of your problem will improve.

Perhaps you find yourself asking, "Can I make our mortgage payment this month?" or "Do I need to take on more patients?" Soon, your inquiries may sound more like: "Should I work three days a week or two?" "How can I develop my leadership skills to better support my team?" or "What can I do to influence the profession?"

Today we find ourselves working to solve a problem of our own invention: How can we write a book that actually makes a dent in the dental world? It's a problem we are glad to have.

But we will tell you up front that this is not another marketing book or a step-by-step guide to achieving the model.
---
# A TALE OF TWO DENTISTS

We can't help you figure out exactly how to market your business or just when to hire an associate. We won't determine whether your individual practice will be most successful by honing in on a specific service, like full-mouth reconstruction; or whether you're best suited to manage multiple locations or a single one-stop shop. If you want a step-by-step guide, there are many other books on the market; and we suggest reading one of those.

Instead, this book is meant to help you see that there are many different factors—and likely ones you've never considered—involved in creating your ideal practice. For example, if you haven't thought about your office culture and its incredible impact on your patients' experience, your team's productivity, and your ability to successfully market your business—and even your own happiness—you've already missed the boat on one of the most valuable (and free) investments you can make. And, as you'll learn, your culture exists, whether you realize it or not.

While the logistical stuff is up to you, we will help you be strategic. We'll show you what has worked for us and how you can successfully apply to your practice the concepts we use in ours. With our support, you can open your mind to options you never thought possible and create a personalized plan to achieve the fulfillment we all seek.

# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP CETS

# PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

~~Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Many practices lack a GPS; there are no goals or destination insight, and no clarity about what makes a good month as opposed to a bad one. The founder simply doesn't lead the team well in the daily battle. Employees don't know their goals, their mission, their motto, or anything else necessary to support and contribute to the practice's success.

When this is the case, you—and your whole team are doing a meaningless job, whether you know it or not: The work
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

becoming scrubbing teeth, sucking spit, and filling in charts.

There needs to be something bigger fueling your work - a thirty-thousand-foot vision of your overarching goals. The granular needs to be part of a grander picture.

You think this is a silly concept: "A vision for dentistry?" you might say; "My vision is making money." With student loans, a mortgage, or anything else that might be on your plate, we understand where you're coming from.

But without a strong vision you're almost guaranteed to be heading in the wrong direction.

In addition, as corporate dentistry becomes a bigger presence in the market, your business concept is even more crucial because any vision, even a soulless corporate one, is more powerful than none at all. Without one, you're totally vulnerable to a takeover bid and susceptible to getting your ass kicked.

Take Domino's Pizza, for example. Even though, in our opinion, their pizza sucks, they have an overarching vision. They have a clear picture of what they're doing and why they're doing it - cornering the market on cheap and efficient meals - and their policies align: if it's not there in thirty minutes or less, the pizza is free. Their goal is not to make the most delicious pizza; it's to make it fast, cheap, and easy to get out the door. Because they're heading toward something defined, they're making progress, improving processes, and aggressively competing with companies big and small.
---
# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP GETS PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

If you do the same, you'll be running a practice that works for you and your patients; a practice that meets and exceeds your goals, a practice that provides the space for continuous improvement and the tremendous gratification it provides.

# Setting an Intention

It's easy to get stuck in the daily grind; those charts need to be done, after all, but achieving a vision is about so much more than that: It's something that excites and enlivens people to reach their destinies and that primary goal makes everything, even mopping the floors, more meaningful.

As scientists, we have formulas for everything, from cleanings to crown prep to answering the phones. As such, other dentists often think that if they follow our exact prescription for business, they'll get the same results: We get calls all the time asking for a detailed marketing plan or the exact training we put our hygienists through. But the reality of success is not in the mechanics; 90 percent of it comes from your intention.

When we were both starting out, we focused on the intentionality of what we wanted to create; we didn't really consider the logistics. Everything was in service of the intention. Our offices became cool practices—cool places to be, even cooler places to work—because even before we laid the first brick or wrote our first employee policy, they were cool in our minds.

The process of creating a bulletproof dental practice requires setting an intention before doing anything logistical.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

It’s imperative to sit down in a quiet room from time to time and visualize your end game:

Before Craig began building his dream practice, he documented his intentions for it. He sketched out his ideas about the design of the building: He imagined what it might feel like to walk through the clean, open layout and greet a team that felt like family—a group who shared his values of providing care of the highest quality and of giving back to the community. But your vision can’t be cut-and-paste. If you want to be successful, you can’t do the same thing everyone else does: Focusing on the experience works for us, but it may not work for you.

Instead, you might decide your ideal practice utilizes a walk-in dental model, with limited exams, limited treatment; and late hours. In fact, we’d love to have someone close by who is open until 11 p.m.; so we could refer our patients there while we’re home with our families! Because we operate in the realm of long-term relationships and comprehensive care, that model wouldn’t be competition, and it would likely be very successful.

It’s time to identify your own ideal model to set your intentions and begin building the vision that’s most motivating to you.

# Crafting Your Unique Vision

The first step is to craft what you want in your vision. Take Brian Banks, a former Marlins baseball player: He left the Marlins and went to dental school at 30-something, with the
---
# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP GETS PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

The sole purpose of doing charity work. Your ultimate plan might be to work three days in your practice to cover your overhead and a fourth day to support your family, and then spend the fifth in a mobile dental truck; helping kids in need. Or, your end goal might be to have twenty practices grossing $20 million annually and to be known as the best at what you do. As long as it's what you want and what will bring you fulfillment; it's valid. Happiness comes from authentic expression.

It's your vision. Don't ever let anybody tell you what it should look like. Your choices may have something to do with money, but not very much. You need to have a successful practice in which you don't feel trapped, but beyond that, let it be individual, like a snowflake.

# Write It Down; Watch It Get Real

It might sound like Woo-woo to you, but the act of explicitly defining your vision helps manifest it.

Pause for a moment and think about what you really want: Grab a piece of paper and a pen or open a blank Word document or your favorite note-taking app. Answer the following questions in as much detail as possible. This is the place to dream big or small, as the case may be: Nothing is off limits, and any and all ideas are worth jotting down:

What does your ideal practice look like? Take into consideration everything from the building you're in to...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

the services You provide, the hours you keep, and the people you work with:

# What does it feel like?

What does it feel like to step through your doors as a practitioner? As a team member? As a patient? What do you see? What is the energy like? How would you want others to describe your offices culture?

# Who are you working with?

Is your team lean, comprising just You, a trusted hygienist, and a dedicated receptionist, or do you imagine a bustling practice with multiple service providers possessing a variety of specialties?

# Who are you serving?

Will generations of family members flow through your doors? Will people travel from across the state or even across the country to access your specialized services and expertise? Will you serve those who might not be able to afford high-quality care on their own? Or is it some combination of all of the above?

The more detailed you are in laying out your plans, the more likely you are to achieve them. Getting crystal clear on where You want to go is the first step in getting there:

# Be Ready to Reengineer

While having an idea of your ideal practice is important; flexibility is also key: You can't just set your vision and forget it. The environment, your team, and life in general will continue to change, and you have to be prepared to adapt:
---
# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP GETS PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

For example; when Peter started his practice, he thought he would be a sole provider and only offer cosmetic services. He was terrific at what he did, and he thought his skills would be enough. That proposition worked well until 2009, when the economic crisis hit and cosmetic dentistry was no longer in demand. Without much need-based dentistry happening in his practice, other than cleanings, the business took a significant hit.

Once he recovered financially, he promised himself he wouldn't get into the same situation again. He realized that he had to create more value for the patient: He reevaluated his mission and decided to move from just focusing on the superficial—making patients look good—to providing the whole package and offering need-based care as well. He brought in associates who could do extractions and root canals, not just to raise revenue, but also to improve the patient experience and save patients time by providing multiple services under one roof. Now they wouldn't need to find another provider when something went wrong.

Your vision is a living, breathing organism; it needs nourishment and attention. Each teammate you add and every curveball in life that comes your way changes the organism itself. It may change one hundred times. Every personal, professional, and practice-related event will help refine your idea and alter the vision as you go. Who knows, therefore, what will.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

happen in ten Even a five-year plan is a bit unrealistic years? But a three-year plan might work ~if you leave plenty of room to adjust: It's also important to note that finding your original vision is perfectly fine, as long as fulfillment: If you decide you want to build twenty practices, but later determine just five are enough, or even that one is accomplishing your goals, that works. Changing your mind does not make you a failure. We'd actually argue that it's quite the opposite.

# Leading Your Vision - It's Not the Military; It's Google

Getting others aligned and on board is essential to effectively transition your vision from the intangible to the concrete. Forward motion requires good leadership and a willingness to reengineer your vision - and the key to good leadership is flexibility. This is not the military; it's Google - a constantly evolving organism with room for team insights and contributions. When you let others be part of what you're rebuilding and seek their ideas and insights, you create an environment that people are excited to be part of. And by involving others, you provide yourself with room to step back and work on the business instead of just in it; ensuring your practice can continue to thrive. These guidelines will get you on the road to meaningful, vision-driven leadership:

- Believe your own hype: Once you develop your vision, make sure you believe it's valid and achievable. Why?
---
# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP GETS PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

People have built-in BS detectors. If you don't buy into your own idea, no one else will, which brings us to the next crucial step.

# Find your first stakeholder:

Once your vision is established, you need to find your first stakeholder: This is one of the most vital parts of making your dream practice a reality. While the overarching concept itself can come from the top, quality leadership is exemplified by those joining you. You need to find someone who is not just an employee, but who will truly adopt and believe in the greater purpose of what you're trying to build.

For example, if you want community service to be a key part of your practice ethos, key stakeholders should also uphold this value. They should demonstrate their dedication to giving back, donating their time and talent to a relevant cause.

A committed stakeholder creates a domino effect; attracting a community who will buy into and help bring your vision to life.

# Communicate your vision.

Next; know that whether you have one teammate or fifty, it's crucial to keep everyone in the loop: Leaders of all industries are guilty of under-communicating their vision. We talk about it with our teams during each and every meeting; with our families over dinner; with our friends during evenings out; even with our patients, describing the granular steps we're...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Taking to create our dream practice - whether it's iPads in the lobby or a new machine to improve crown prep: We feel like because we've said it so many times, everybody must know it: But likely you haven't even scratched the surface. If you think you're a high-end, fee-for-service practice, but your team thinks you're a volume-run insurance practice, then you'll wind up somewhere totally different from where you're intending to go.

You need to describe your vision so many times to your team that the thought of saying it one more time makes you want to vomit; then you'll know you're halfway done.

Making it big is about baby steps. Incremental movements over time create massive trajectory and crazy velocity toward an end goal. You probably have your time horizons all wrong; people always overestimate what they can do in a year and grossly underestimate what can be done in five.

Chip away and know where you're headed. By making 'leading the team toward my vision' part of your daily tasks, you can ensure you're always making progress. Peter stays on track by asking himself, "Is there anything I can do today that just moves the needle a little bit? Even 1 percent; a half percent, a quarter percent?" It reminds him to align his thinking throughout the day with his greater goals, which then transcends to the team during their daily meeting.

You can ask yourself the following:
---
# VISIONEERING: LEADERSHIP GETS PEOPLE ALIGNED AND EXCITED

What will I do to align with the master vision of the practice?

How will I set my team in motion through inspiration, confidence, and leadership?

Know this: your dental education does not make you uniquely skilled to run a practice. Many of our peers have a hard time giving up control: The minute someone else throws out an idea or attempts to address a problem with critical thinking, their first question is, "Where did you go to dental school?" Somewhere along the way, we decided that, as a result of our advanced education, we’ve been granted the supreme authority to come up with anything requiring brain cells.

But the question at hand may have nothing to do with dental school. Whether it’s addressing call volume, improving the patient intake process, or marketing your business, 99 percent of the things that help a dental office run smoothly certainly don’t require a DMD or DDS.

To be efficient and effective and to grow into the practice you want to be, you need to relinquish control to your (hopefully) very qualified and capable team. Your team wants to do more than just suck spit, too.

# Let Your Team Take the Lead

If you describe your vision effectively, your employees will be eager to contribute, feeling like they’re part of you.

# leadership and

Your assistant might have great ideas about organizational structure:

Believing that you're the only person who cares enough, the only person who's smart enough to run your practice, is detrimental to every aspect of your business. When you refuse knowledge, insight, and creativity from employees who want to do more; you're not being a leader; you're being a limiter: you’re subtracting rather than multiplying the talents at hand.

You don't have all the answers, and when you feel like you do, we'll bet that your employees are not engaged or interested in helping you achieve your goals. At any given point, 85 percent of employees in the United States are looking for another job.

If your team members are spending the day asking themselves, "How do I get the hell out of here?" you have a house of cards that's ready to fall. And that lack of engagement is palpable to your patients.

We also don't have any issues delegating: We trust our employees and we know that it's essential to get out of their way and let them do their jobs, both for their own benefit and ours. We try very hard to make sure our offices are safe places for ideas. If a proposal makes sense to us as leaders, if it aligns with everything else we're doing, we're happy to try it out:

For instance, one of Peter's employees approached him one day with an idea for a texting service. "Hey," she said, "I know...

this is your practice, but I talk to patients all day long, and I think it might be great to let patients text for appointments as opposed to calling us. The text service has been incredibly successful, simplifying the process for everyone involved: It's something he never would have thought of on his own; and it wouldn't have come about if his office environment wasn't conducive to input.

Craig was also able to add significant value to his practice by calling on his team to contribute. A few years ago, he told his team that he wanted to become an elite and very successful Invisalign practice. At the time, they were doing about thirty cases annually but the team suggested that within a year, they could be handling one hundred cases in the same timeframe. Craig thought that was quite a stretch. He wanted to tell them they were crazy.

Instead, he stayed quiet, "If you accomplish your goal," he told them, "I'll take everyone to the Ritz-Carlton for the weekend." He would essentially throw a mini wedding. They readily accepted his challenge and assembled a small, self-managed team. The group put systems and processes in place: Each morning, they flagged all of the patients who had orthodontic coverage as part of their insurance. They sent everyone home with printed photos of their lower teeth crowding. They created rewards for the team so that every time the practice added a new case, employees were rewarded.

with ice cream, doughnuts, or a visit from a food truck. A year later; the team hit its goal.

As the team members were celebrating at the Ritz-Carlton, they said, "We're gonna double it for next year; we'll do two hundred cases." Again, Craig thought that was absolutely crazy and that there was no possible chance of that happening, but he didn't say that: He remained open to the possibility. Once again, the team hit its goal.

When you create a vision that is greater than yourself and you give people the power to contribute through effective leadership and encouragement, you also gain freedom. We can spend time with our families, go on vacation, and focus on growing our practices to be even more successful because everyone on our teams works to move the needle, and we trust them to do so. By creating the space to allow people to grow and contribute, you can do the same:

# LAY DOWN THE LAW;

BUT MAKE IT PEARSONS LAW

That which is measured improves

That which is measured and reported improves exponentially

~~Karl Pearson

You are probably familiar with Pearson's Law: (That which is measured improves: That which is measured and reported improves exponentially:

2) You may know that metrics are in driving business outcomes, but many dentists don’t understand how this applies to their own practices: They don’t know what to track; if they’re tracking at all.

The bottom line is that metrics matter. They’re the only way to know whether what you’re doing is working: Your numbers - the most important ones, at least - should be on

the tip of your tongue at all times. They should also be on the tip of your team members' tongues.

Consultants and accountants will suggest a traditional series of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and many of those are fine. But if they’re not actionable, what’s the point?

We’ll tell you the metrics we monitor religiously to evaluate the general health of our practices, along with the essential methods—more than just KPIs—that help us stay self-aware and keep a finger on the pulse of what’s happening in every part of the business, from the front desk to the chair and beyond. Because, as you’ve already (we hope) begun to see; quality is just as important as quantity, and having a strong understanding of both is crucial to your success:

It’s also up to you to assess the value of the data you’re taking in and to ensure that you know what they really mean.

You may not be doing as well as you think: For example, production—the amount of money you charge for a particular service—is part of the traditional set of KPI that any consultant or accountant will tell you to track; but it’s your collections—the dollars you’re actually bringing in—that really count.

Who cares what you technically produced if only part of that is hitting your bank account? It’s often a blow to our fragile dentist egos, but if you don’t turn a critical eye to what’s really going on, the consequences could be.

# Do You Have a Handle on Your Data?

How do You manage your data? Both of us are paying customers of a company called DentalIntelligence, ka. Dental Intel, an excellent patient-management software tool.

Its web-based dashboard provides an easy, intuitive platform for key metrics. It tracks everything from financials to patient visits and provider performance, pulls custom reports, and spits out numbers that would take hours to crunch by hand:

# Here are some of the features Dental Intel offers:

- Provides a unified platform, enabling every member of your team to view and share the same information.
- Links to your financial software to break down practice performance.
- Highlights exceptional provider and team areas of performance, as well as those that could be improved:
- Analyzes data to recommend growth strategies.
- Supplies expert data analysts and a dedicated coach to help you interpret your findings and take action:

We think it's worth it to invest in a tool that not only will simplify your life, but also will provide insights that have the potential to significantly enhance your practice.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

While less traditional, we believe the following factors are also crucial to your success. These metrics are our MVPs. Consider adding these to your list of key measures:

# Are You Retaining the Patients You Already Have?

Almost all dentists track the number of new patients they’re bringing in, but that number alone tells us very little about net growth. You may be bringing in a hundred new patients a month, but what is your retention rate? How many active patients do you have—in other words, individuals who have seen you in the last eighteen months? Even a day after the month mark, their affinity for your practice is virtually nil; the second they see a Groupon for that new corporate office next to the coin-operated ponies in your local Walmart, it’s all over:

Peter faced this exact issue in 2008, as the economy began to collapse: Fearing for the fate of his practice, he turned his focus—and his funds—toward recruitment rather than retention. Since he wasn’t investing in keeping his current patients, they were easily swayed when incentives to try other practices came along: If he had instead turned the majority of his attention toward engaging active patients, he would have avoided some of the losses he experienced in terms of people and profits.

Inactive patients add zero value to your practice: If you acquired a hundred new patients in August, but a hundred fifty became inactive in the same month, your net growth is 32.

# LAY DOWN THE LAW, BUT MAKE IT PEARSON'S LAW

negative fifty: Not only is your practice a revolving door; but its also letting more people out than in. Youre kind of loss is one of the most expensive problems you can have: Dentists think onboarding a new patient is s0 sexy—and it is—but if you cant keep new patients, redrowning: you

Its also important to note that an existing patient typically accepts more than 50 percent of the treatment plan you present; whereas a new patient—someone who has never met you and who may have come through the door due to advertising—may accept just 10 percent of what you offer: And what they choose to do will probably not pay nearly as much as what an established patient would compared to the money you’ve spent to attract them, the time and effort you’ve put into constructing a plan; finding treatment and the inevitable cost of a new batch of clients when they don’t return because they don’t really give a shit about you: If you’re just a commodity you can easily be swapped out for convenience or value:

Its about more than just metrics. Keeping patients who know and love you in your chair is not just smarter; its also more fulfilling: You want people who will listen to what you say and take it to heart; both for the dollar value and the gratification that comes from doing meaningful work.

# Is Your Pre-Appointment Rate Watertight?

Effort cultivating that treatment plan and putting everything we have into it; so why wouldn't we check in afterward? Sometimes multiple hours are spent on consultation. If we're tracking our time in our conversion, how will we know whether something's broken?

Aim for 70 percent acceptance. That number accounts for the fact that one-third of people say yes to everything, one-third of people say no to everything, and the remaining third accepts just part of the plan. Pushing for 70 percent means converting some of those nos to yeses.

There's a flip side, too: If you start tracking and you realize your enrollment is 95 percent; it's not time to start celebrating. That high number typically means you're under-diagnosing: You're not giving patients the comprehensive, big-picture, quality treatment they deserve.

Dentistry is the only medical profession that chooses to watch disease. Your oncologist won't say; "Oh, you have a little fleck of cancer; we'll just watch it until it gets bigger;" until one day he or she has to cut your entire fucking liver out.

Although dental issues almost never reverse themselves, we are happy to just "watch" them: If you're letting your patients go on with small problems that could easily be fixed, you're doing them a disservice.

It's easy to think you're doing a great job if you're not tracking anything, but when you look at the data, you have...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

to acknowledge the reality: You’re enrolling too much or too little, and you have some work to do. It may be hard to face the fact that you might think you’re not as awesome as you are. But the cool part is, everyone will benefit: You’ll be more efficient. Your team will work harder to make it happen. You’ll always plus—but you’ll also be better; make more money and that in itself makes it all worth it.

This is also an area in which you may have to add to your skill set: You may have to work on giving your patients a big picture that they can understand. You may also have to work on your people skills. Can you pick up on body language and modify your presentation based on who is in your chair?

If Peter meets someone like himself—a ‘driver’—he’ll talk in bullet points. But if someone like his mom is seated in front of him, someone who needs a bit more coddling, he’ll slow it down and mirror her movements. If he sees he’s suggested something that’s made her uncomfortable, he’ll pump the brakes a bit, but he’ll continue because he wants her to enroll, and he knows he’s being tracked, so he can make sure it’s working.

Another essential piece of the treatment plan is your team delivering your greatest presentation. You’ve just walked out of the room after you and your patient, Mrs. Jones, have bonded, and she’s just glowing; she already has her smile in mind.
---
# LAY DOWN THE LAW; BUT MAKE IT PEARSON'S LAW

But then your teammate comes in with a pissy look on her face or a snotty attitude. Or Mrs. Jones heads to the treatment coordinator to book the next appointment and instead of saying, 'Oh, congratulations! All of Dr. Spodak's patients are SO happy with his work: I'm so proud that you made this decision;' the coordinator just says, "How would you like to pay?" Or if Mrs. Jones asks your assistant what he would do, and he says, 'I'd only do that one crown;' there could be a big, costly link missing from your process:

You want your team to be able to say, 'He did my veneers: He did my Invisalign, and I LOVE the results.' That's the most credible thing: Would every member of your team be your patient? If yes, you're fine: If you have a feeling that every member wouldn't, you have some serious work to do.

# How Much Money Does Each Patient Spend per Visit?

This one is very simple: How much does a patient who walks through your door spend, on average? If you track the number of patient visits and the amount each patient spends and then work to increase those numbers, your business can't help but grow. If you do nothing else, track these numbers. It's Pearson's Law in action. This is also where patient-management software like Dental Intel is invaluable. These numbers, which would normally take some hardcore data analysis to arrive at, are automatically extracted and ready for review whenever you are.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

# Is Your Overhead on Point?

We mostly agree with the traditional recommendations for overhead costs.

Overall, your goal for overhead should be 60 percent: While we spend less than the national average, which is around 73 percent, we’re careful to maintain the value and the experience our patients have come to expect. We give our patients more than most other offices do, and we make more money by doing so. You don’t want to skinny it down too much, because below 60 percent, there’s a degradation of experience and quality of care. If you’re using the shittiest labs, the crappiest equipment, and the cheapest employees in town, your overhead might be 45 percent, but we guarantee you that nobody is talking positively about that practice.

And because we provide a better experience in terms of both the environment and the quality of care patients receive, we’re able to charge more for our services - and revenue goes up, sending expenses down in proportion to that increase. That gives us the bandwidth to do some special things for our patients - the people most deserving of our dollar.

# Are You Social Enough?

We keep an eye on the number of reviews we get each month and the content. We also keep track of how many page views we get on social media and the number of interactions we have across platforms. This provides valuable insight into
---
# LAY DOWN THE LAW, BUT MAKE IT PEARSON'S LAW

What people are saying about us and allows us to evaluate our social traction from both a quantitative - how many reviews, likes, and such are coming in - and a qualitative perspective. If you have five Yelp reviews that say your receptionist was rude, she probably is, and it's time to address it:

# Is Your Team Tuned In?

Knowing the right metrics to track and keeping your eye on your progress is not a one-person job. Your team also needs to understand exactly what you're looking at, what you're hoping to achieve, and where you are right now. Along with shared patient-management software, we hold meetings every morning to discuss metrics and make sure our team is in the loop, and you should, too.

# Can You Keep People Onboard?

Everyone talks about capital expenses, about buying a CEREC or an X-ray machine; but the most important capital is human capital. The largest percentage of your overhead is always going to be your people. The average American dental staff costs 30 percent in overhead.

Why are most practices paying so much? Because they have to hire more people to do the same amount of stuff: How do we get our people to do more? We don't manage them; we lead them. Stuff needs to be managed. People need to be led. As a result, our teams are more engaged and more productive. They feel a sense of ownership.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Because our practices are great places to work, we also lose savings. When employees leave, it actually costs three times their salaries to replace them. If you lose a hygienist or two every year; you squander hundreds of thousands of dollars in productivity.

It's the best thing you can do to raise your overhead. In turn, retaining team members is the best thing you can do to lower it, plain and simple. We have employees who are celebrating their eight- and ten-year work anniversaries because we are focused on building our leadership skills and because we're not assholes—well, not all the time.

Because employee satisfaction is essential to keeping our overhead low and, more importantly, to cultivating a great atmosphere for us and our patients alike, we are constantly thinking about how to serve our people better: Craig has lunch prepared in-house for every single member of his team every single day. Although it may seem like that expense would drive up overhead, it actually lowers it; because practices like these make people likely to stick around. You could start implementing an initiative like this by providing lunch just one day a week and observing its impact on morale. Plus, when you treat your team well, they show the same courtesy to your patients.

What you appreciate appreciates in value. Focus on getting top talent and do what it takes to keep them because that will help preserve your top line: your profitability and your happiness.

# Are You Your Own Best Advertiser?

What you should spend on advertising depends on a number of factors. If your practice is well established, you might spend as little as 2 to 3 percent on advertising, whereas those just out the gate may want to lay out around 10 percent. Either way, it's important to remember that advertising is not just paying external companies to promote your business.

Zappos was built on providing incredible customer service, and the iconic support they offer falls under their advertising budget. When Starbucks was just a start-up, they got the word out by branding the shit out of their cups and making their environment cool.

Maybe as a new practice you spend 7 percent of your budget on external ads and 3 percent on branded swag: lip balm, sunglasses, giveaways, etc. We consider these items a crucial part of our advertising. We suggest striving for an even split: spending half of your advertising dollar externally and half on the stuff you do to set your practice apart.

Consider giving each new patient a nice gift; for example, Peter gives out high-quality candles to promote his practice's spa-like feel—the cost of which falls under your advertising budget. This also helps invoke the law of reciprocity: if people feel like you've given them something, they feel psychologically compelled to return the favor. That might just mean continuing to patronize your business.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

It might mean accepting more treatment than they would have otherwise.

Craig has also learned that your giveaways don't have to scream your brand name to be effective. In fact, it's often better to give away something someone will use frequently—and therefore remember you by—than something loud and tacky that will sit in the back of a closet: No one needs a T-shirt that reads: SPODAK DENTAL FREE-WHITENING PROMO WINNER.

You started this chapter just looking for a little more information on KPIs, and you may have gotten more than you bargained for: Perhaps this is the moment when you have to evaluate your current practices and come to terms with the reality that you're not God's gift to dentistry after all.

We get it; we have those moments, too. Plenty of times. Ignorance is bliss, and tracking means that you have to take a hard look at what's working and what isn't and acknowledge that you are probably at fault for the things that aren't. But if you want to build a bulletproof practice, that self-awareness is imperative. Knowing makes you better on every level, and I guarantee, if you commit, you'll be more than happy with the results.

# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far; go together: ~~African proverb

Joward Schultz, executive chairman and former CEO of an organization of America' Europe- a place where people could always slow down; comfortably chill, and sip their coffee. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, encouraged his team to bump house music at Virgin's airport check-in areas because he ~and, by extension, his brand- likes to party. These unique characteristics are emblematic of company culture, and it's culture that sets these iconic businesses apart:

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

All elite, high-performing companies have outstanding cultures, and successful dental practices are no different: But culture is not only for the exceptional; your practice has a culture, whether you know it or not: It's also highly visible, even if you can't see it: We can read your reviews or walk through your doors and then tell you what it is right off the bat:

But if you didn't design it, how did your culture come about? It is the product of the cumulative beliefs, ideals, and behaviors of you and your team, repeated day in and day out. Your culture has a tremendous impact, not just on your team and the feel of your office, but also on patient care, so it's essential that you get it right:

As the owner of your practice, you are the primary visionary; and no one can exceed your role in setting the tone: So, if you feel like life in your office sucks, it probably does, and it's most likely on you: If your team sucks, you suck. If your team isn't treating patients well, you probably aren't either:

Some people think that taking responsibility for all the problems in your practice is an oppressive way to live: It's not; it's actually hugely liberating: It's the only way to control your destiny. And when you control your own destiny, you're never a victim of anything:

If you're realizing your culture is crap right now, that's OK. You just have to commit to doing the work to change it for the better: That may mean stepping up and making

some hard decisions, but your life—and your team members' lives—will be better for it.

# Culture Comes from Intention

Like much of what we're talking about; 90 percent of your culture actually comes from your intention: We envisioned our cultures before they existed, and, as a result; what we built reflects our goals. Your job is to create the possibility: Culture is a constant and gentle drumming, but you need to start the beat.

Maybe you know you have a shitty culture and you're ready to face it and make some big changes. Or maybe your environments are great; but you want to hold onto it as you scale. If so, it's imperative that you preserve—and even enhance—that awesome culture: You can't just add bodies. Your growth has to be organic; it has to be sustainable. If your culture gets degraded or diluted along the way you're going to have huge problems; think back to what we said about the money-eating monster of turnover; not to mention the misery it brings with it.

But how do you create—or maintain—that contagious culture that everyone talks about, but few can implement? We'll give you the tools to figure it out and tell you how to go further and get better; no matter where you are.

yourself on the back and move on with your life, you need to figure out whether your perception is really accurate. How?

Crowdsource your team members to see whether they feel the same way: You can do so anonymously to help your team avoid the pressure to be anything but honest: An online vehicle like SurveyMonkey is an easy and free option that will allow you to do just that: Ask the following questions:

- How would you describe our current culture?
- How do you feel when you come to work?
- How do you think our patients feel when they arrive? When they leave?
- Can you describe our belief system? Do you think it could be improved?
- What are our values? Do you think they translate to our culture?

If you ask what your office stands for—other than making money—and you get a different answer from every member of your team, you need to define the culture you want and start taking steps to get there:

# Honest Feedback Is Essential to Your Success

To be a truly effective leader; the kind who can create an unarguably excellent culture, you have to be willing to learn about yourself. Sometimes that means being open and vulnerable in ways that can be uncomfortable, but your level of openness will directly determine how much you can grow.

# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

As dentists, we are trained to look good, even though when we first come out of school, we don't know what the hell we're doing: Faking it until we make it is part of the job. Many of us can remember boldly assuring our patients, "Yeah, I see this problem all the time; I know exactly what to do;" before running out of the room to look it up.

This is especially true in terms of the business aspects of our practices. There is no business training in dental school—not a single hour of coursework. We get four years of how to fix a tooth and little else.

But when you open your own practice, you are running a business immediately—something that takes decades to learn how to do, let alone perfect. We make sure to maintain a novice mentality: Even after all this time, we remain aware of the fact that we don't know anything. That openness is what allows us to advance. We seek out and learn from each other; and from our teams, all the time. We’re constantly asking the people in our offices for feedback. Ask your team the following:

- What are three things I should never stop doing?
- What are three things I should stop doing immediately?
- What piece of advice would you give me to help me be a better leader?

We are certainly familiar with the challenge of facing less-than-positive feedback. One day, out of the blue, Craig received a handwritten note from an important member of his team.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

In her note; she explained that she felt he wasn't practicing what he preached. She too wanted to make a mark on the dental world, but she felt there was dissonance happening in the practice and that it was holding her back. Unless things changed, she would have to leave.

While it wasn't easy to receive her feedback, Craig realized his teammate's assessment was spot-on, and that he did need to change: He sought out insights from the rest of the team, opening up an important dialogue on leadership. Though some of their comments were hard to hear; the few moments of discomfort were definitely worth the outcome: When you solicit feedback, some of what you get back might be hurtful; it will take real commitment to take a long, honest look at yourself and how you appear to others. You might know your intention, which is all well and good, but if you're still showing up as an asshole, that's a problem:

You may hear; "You change your mind a lot, Doc" Or, "You didn't have my back when this happened, so now I can't have yours." It's essential for you to know what your team thinks of you because it's your culture in action, and it's the only way you can make meaningful changes.

Self-evaluation might hurt now, but the short-term sacrifice will definitely pay off in the long run. Don't get too emotional; it's just data, and it's fixable. But the fixing it is incumbent.

# Check Yourself to Make Room for Community

If you started your own practice right out of school, you did it all. The first day on the job, you booked the appointments, you worked the credit card machine, you even unclogged the toilet: But then you hired more people: If you can't shake that lone-wolf mentality we guarantee you are getting in your own way, and in your team's way as well:

This is where a paradigm shift might need to occur: If you think, These are my staff and I pay them; therefore, they should do what I want; that mentality has to end today:

Nine times out of ten, we hear dentists refer to their people as 'staff'. Staff is an infection. This is your team: Your teammates help propel your business, and you need to think of and refer to them as such.

We've even heard doctors reference their team members as pieces of furniture: I need a new front desk; one guy told us. When expressed confusion, he went, Oh, yeah; she's quitting: I need someone else.

She is not a desk. She's not even just your receptionist; she's your front line - the first face your patients see - and she's just as important as everyone else in your office, especially when it comes to culture.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

But there’s an even higher order that should be at work in your practice. Teams are groups of people organized around tasks, but a community is a group of people organized around relationships. Teams can fracture themselves into parts of a whole ~ the phone answerers, the spit suckers ~ but if any team within the whole fails, everyone does. When the members of the group know that if one faction fails, they all do, they’re far more likely to provide support to one another: That’s because what we’re really talking about ~ the bigger picture ~ is community: If someone in a community gets sick, the other members step up to help. It’s a win-win deal for everyone involved.

# Maintain Your Culture or Watch It Turn to Chaos

You don’t have to plant weeds in your garden; they just show up. You can’t just have one big hurrah meeting about your culture and then leave it on the shelf. If you do, you can count on the drift ~ the entropy of things ~ to take you right back to where you started, or worse: You’ve got to get down on your knees and pull the fucking weeds out; over and over again.

We talk about our culture every day: During Craig’s morning huddle; he provides examples of core values in action. In both our practices, we give kudos to each other for the support we’ve received or for a job well done. It’s peer-to-peer recognition. It’s authentic, and it means something ~ especially in front of an audience of colleagues.

# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

Craigh has a peer-to-peer reward system: Team members give "Spodak Dental Bucks" to recognize others' contributions, and can either be traded in for cash or experiences. But if staff members trade them in for cash, they only get half the value: The idea is to go for the experiences because they're what people will remember; and they will know the office was part of them.

Peter offers a similar proposition: teammates can recognize others' contributions by putting accolades in buckets with members' names on them. Each month, the person with the most praise gets to pick from a grab bag of pretty exciting gifts, like a $1,000 American Express card or a weekend stay at the St. Regis. Focusing on adding value and creating a reward for performance while reinforcing accountability to the whole team encourages people to go above and beyond. It also keeps our awesome culture going, day after day, week after week, month after month.

# Don't Focus on Process; Focus on Results

Everything in the office should be a conversation about results, not processes. When you're working as part of a process, it's easy to do your part and pass the buck, but if you all have the same likely goal, you're more likely to stay motivated and do what it takes to achieve it. If you want to confirm 100 percent of all appointments booked, and the process is to call twice and move on to the next patient; it all ends with that second—and potentially disregarded call.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

However; if you're shooting for the result that 100 percent of patients actually show up, you may have to turn on your brain and think a little bit to get there. If we agree on the result, the process can be flexible, and that's where the magic happens:

Say someone calls because he's upset over a twenty-five-dollar fluoride charge, and the person at the front desk fumbles because she doesn't have a script for that: She needs to check with three other managers because she's not empowered to handle it on her own. By the time she gets back to the patient, he's pissed about the wait and maybe even ready to dump you altogether over what is essentially a drop in the bucket.

But what if your receptionist is free to make her own decisions; as long as they align with the basic tenets of the practice? If you have a culture that can give context, rather than the answers—if you encourage the idea that people are intelligent enough to make decisions on their own and your team members know what they have the creative power to do, they'll usually do a great job—maybe an even better one than you would have:

Your receptionist may just refund that twenty-five-dollar charge, a decision that—with less autonomy—could have taken many more dollars' worth of everybody's time and thus convert a patient from disgruntled to delighted without your even having to get involved.

Every situation won't be handled exactly the way you would have done it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing:

Long as the results are in line with the big picture, the what and the how don’t matter very much: There’s no script here, and that makes for an authentic, energized culture: People are more fulfilled, more in control of their own destiny; and they’re ready to contribute their best work.

# Make a Millennial Mindset Work for You

Older dentists tell us all the time that they don’t understand millennials; these dentists think that millennials have a shitty work ethic. Millennials don’t want to do what they’re told just because you tell them to do it: However, millennials are actually quite dedicated when they know the "why" behind the direction: They’re willing to take basic, minimum-wage jobs and work their asses off when they believe in what they’re doing.

For the last hundred years, we’ve maintained a factory mentality in which people have been told that their thoughts, opinions, and ideas don’t matter; that they’re just there to work. But dentistry is a service industry: Being able to use your brain is an asset, and millennials want to do just that.

Plus, as we age, the old aphorism, "If you can’t beat 'em; join 'em," still stands: millennials will soon make up the majority of both practice owners and patients, and you need to tailor your culture accordingly if you don’t want to be left in the dust.

# Who Will Protect This House?

# The Beauty of Self-Managed Teams

Remember the 2003 Under Armour commercials that asked athletes, "Who will protect this house?" One guy yells that question to a group of athletes gathered around him, and the entire group shouts back; "I WILL!" in unison. The energy in that room is palpable, and the energy in your office should be the same.

Craig's teams hire their own people: The person coming on is someone who will likely work with the group for years, so why shouldn't the team members have a say in whether he or she is a good fit?

Peter reminds his teams of that Under Armour commercial whenever it's time to bring someone new onboard; if you love where you work and you care deeply about the culture, it's the team's responsibility to find someone who protects their house—someone who will help maintain and advance that positive energy.

Self-management also prevents the childish, tattletale tendencies that often go hand in hand with top-down management. Rather than complaining to one of us when someone’s not pulling his or her weight, our teammates resolve it among themselves, like adults.

We hold ourselves to the same standard. Craig's team has called him on being late to meetings before, and he encourages.
---
# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

As the leader of the practice, you're not above the law. Instead, you should be more susceptible to it. Under your leadership and a culture that makes the office standards clear; your team should have the guidelines to manage themselves successfully—a concept that works to everyone's advantage.

# Cultivate a Sense of Ownership

A pervasive ownership mentality is quality culture: When you go to a restaurant and the server is talking about the specials and says, "Oh my God, I tried the snapper today: It was amazing: It was caught by this guy named Jerry, using an old-school spearfishing method. I know his son; you’re ready to order that damn fish." You feel good about your server: You feel great about the restaurant: Those are the kind of results that a sense of ownership delivers.

Peters team members take pride in their space: He's put a lot of time and money into making it pristine, relaxing, and comfortable. It's a living room for guests, not a waiting room for patients. If the team members were to see a piece of trash in their living room, they'd pick it up, and they maintain the office with the same courtesy and attention to detail. Because there is a sense of ownership among everyone who works with us, our cultures have become bigger and stronger than us.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

We both believe that the only way to get to the top is by bringing others with us. The non-dentists in our practice tell us all the time that they wish they could buy into our businesses, and that's part of how we know we're doing it right:

In fact; as of this writing, we're exploring ways to create performance-based compensation or to have conversations about equity with our non-dentist employees. This might sound crazy to you, but we're not talking twenty cooks in the kitchen; we're talking twenty teammates pulling toward the same goal—all of whom have skin in the game:

What do you give up when you give away a portion of your pie? We say, nothing: Skin in the game from your team is sound ROI. It's engagement; it's a chip on the table, and it's a true investment that will pay dividends.

If you build an incredible practice, amazing value, and a raving fan base—all products of an exceptional culture—you don't have to worry about the typical fears that keep most dentists up at night: insurance, the costliness of high turnover; the next corporate takeover: A contagious culture means a better life for all involved—and simple: Your team will exceed your wildest expectations, but only once you set the tone.

# Leaving Millions on the Table

Your retirement plan is making someone rich—and it's not you: This is the painful lesson that Craig and his team members found out the hard way:
---
# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

A few years ago, Craig was approached by one of his employees, who had just finished reading Tony Robbins' number one bestseller; Unshakeable: Your Financial Freedom Playbook. In the book, Tony interviews the world's top financial experts, and there was near universal consensus that most 401(k) plans are plagued with excessive and hidden fees that quietly erode your returns. After initially brushing off this member, she explained that Craig was known as the 'plan sponsor' and was personally liable for making sure the fees were benchmarked periodically. She had his attention now.

He was reluctant to go through the exercise of uncovering the fees because (a) he thought 401(k) plans were set and forget, and he assumed that there was no way a giant name brand could be screwing him; and (b) he liked the broker and the free doughnuts he brought the office staff every so often. Turns out, those doughnuts were the most expensive pastries known to mankind!

After sending his fee disclosure document to a 401(k) specialist, Craig and the other plan participants found out that they were paying well over 2 percent in annual fees, once all the layers of the onion were peeled back. Truth be told, Craig was still unsure that 2 percent was really all that bad. These all sounded like small percentages. But small percentages compound! Once he saw how those fees erode the plan over time; he was floored.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Get this: Vanguard founder Jack Bogle says that excessive fees can erode up to two thirds of your future potential nest egg: If you could have had $3 million in retirement savings, you will only have $1 million if you don't eliminate excessive fees. Craig immediately took action and found a firm called Americas Best 401k, which has become wildly popular among dentists in recent years.

The fees were just 0.5 percent annually a 75-percent reduction from his original plan: What's more is that they never take commissions; they cut out all brokers and unnecessary middlemen; and they only offer low-cost index funds, which have been shown to outperform most other funds over time.

The result? Craig was able to put seven figures back into his pocket and the pockets of his team members. That might sound like an exaggeration until you look at the chart below to see how a low-cost plan like Americas Best 401k compares to typical plans, which are usually offered through name-brand insurance companies or national payroll companies that plaster their names on stadiums and blimps.

| |Low Cost Provider|Company A|Company B|
|---|---|---|---|
|Annual Fees|0.50%|1.50%|2.25%|
|Year 1|$1,000,000|$1,000,000|$1,000,000|
|Year 5|$1,976,459|$1,895,765|$1,837,086|
|Year 10|$3,314,293|$3,066,494|$2,892,786|
|Year 20|$7,658,540|$6,596,365|$5,903,308|
|Year 30|$15,813,289|$12,625,894|$10,691,616|

# YOUR CULTURE CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU

Note: This assumes a plan with a starting balance of $1 million, annual contributions of $100,000, and gross returns of 7 percent annualized:

Treating team members like family is remembering that one day, their 401(k) plan (and yours, for that matter) will be their sole source of income. And yet; there is an epidemic of crappy 401(k) plans. You might be thinking that your 401(k) is just fine, but let me assure you, most plans look fine on the surface (especially during a bull market) but; like termites behind the walls, hidden fees are quietly eroding your nest egg.

By visiting the link below, you can take five minutes to quickly uncover the fees in your plan: Americas Best 401k will do this for you for no charge and they will also send you a free copy of Tony's number one bestselling book, Unshakeable.

There is nothing to lose by going through this simple exercise: FreeTonyBook.com

We are so excited about the work that Americas Best 401k is doing in dentistry that we decided to join their Board of Ambassadors in the hopes that we can help spread the word and get these expensive plan providers out of our pockets once and for all.

# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION IS WAY OVERRATED

Entrepreneurs distracted by productivity and miss get profits. Corporate folk distracted by efficiencies and miss get effectiveness. But ballers? Ballers know the difference between a back and a hoop every time. Take your shot.

~Richie Norton

Afraid of a corporate takeover? It's not just your imagination. Every single day, eleven corporate dental offices open across the United States. That's seventy-seven a week. Four thousand fifteen per year: While, according to the American Dental Association, 70 percent of practices are now privately owned, that number is expected to go down drastically in the next five years.

61
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

There are multiple factors responsible for corporate's fast-growing presence in dentistry:

# Industry Interest from VCs

Venture capitalists have realized that dental practices are a good investment; and, as such, billions of dollars of VC and private-equity funds are entering the market: Encouraging investors to keep coming back, and they’re dumping more money into the system all the time.

# Poorly Managed Private Practices

Not to beat a dead horse, but most private practitioners don’t recognize that because they’re doctors, their patients are lucky to have them, so they don’t need to invest any additional brainpower into their enterprises. As a result, they’re neglecting the metrics, culture, service offerings, and marketing opportunities that could make them more competitive, and leaving a big share of the market up for grabs.

# Inordinate Amounts of Student Debt

The cost of education is rising across all sectors, and graduates are forced to choose their career paths accordingly: When Peter graduated from dental school, he had about $160,000 in student debt. That’s a lot of money, or so he thought: Today, nobody raises an eyebrow until you’re looking at $400,000, $450,000, $500,000 in loans.
---
# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION IS WAY OVERRATED

With such a high price to pay upon graduation, it's hard to fathom borrowing even more money or getting a bank to lend it to you in the first place to start your own practice. On top of that, corporate practices have begun recruiting future dentists on the first day of dental school orientation, often sponsoring the event itself! They’re in the door from day one, and that too is affecting post-graduation career decisions.

# That Millennial Mentality

Millennials don’t necessarily dream of owning a practice: They want to work to live, not live to work; the long hours and lifelong investment of practice ownership just doesn’t have the same appeal it did for our generation and those that came before us. And that’s changing everything: Still, we don’t believe corporate is the infallible enemy that it’s made out to be. Corporate guys know they’re running a business. They look at their numbers. They track their performance, and that gives them a leg up. But their business savvy is the only real advantage they have. When VC-owned practices prioritize treatment and sales over building long-term relationships and patient satisfaction, they’re bound to lose out in the end.

We’re not saying you shouldn’t be worried about it: If you’re on cruise control and you’ve been doing the same thing for twenty years, yes, you are primed to be pushed out.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

But the solo practices that are flourishing right now are flourishing for a reason, and they'll continue to do so, whether or not corporate has a share of the market: Cottage-industry dentistry will always win if done correctly, and we look at our happy patients and satisfied teams as primary indicators of our success. It's not as daunting as the battle of Amazon versus brick-and-mortar malls is; you can still win in the corporate dentistry era. Don't believe for a moment that you must succumb.

# The Cottage-Industry Advantage

We love the cottage industry of dentistry. It's what attracted us to the field in the first place. If we wanted to be employed by a conglomerate, we would have become MDs and gone to work for hospitals. But we were attracted to the ability to express our own unique visions, to the idea of providing meaningful and comprehensive long-term relationships: treatment; and to the third-generation dentist, Craig, who has seen patients who have been to his father and his grandfather for treatment. He grew up around people who had worked in the family practice for fifteen years. This history and these relationships can't be monetized. They're enduring, and they're not dead. If you want them, they're there.

Corporate is all about profits; that's all outside investors care about: Therefore, all decisions are short-term ones. They'll make a huge money shot on the front end and expect to see.
---
# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION /S WAY OVERRATED

immediately; They` want revenue profits rob from next week to make this one look good. We private practitioners don’t care about Tuesday as long as we’re making moves that will create long-term value: We’ll spend money this week on culture or human capital or physical capital on stuff that will give us a ROI in two or three years.

And, whereas corporate will expect your company to run like a fully automated factory after that first infusion, we’re continually investing and reinvesting in our practices. Ye're not worried one bit about corporate takeover: On our own ground, in our own personal environments, we’ve got this. Come on over; Corporate; we’ll beat your ass every time. You can’t tool.

This is where we—and you—have the advantage: It’s the same for any business model. Grandma’s Pizza Shoppe is not nervous when Papa John’s comes to town because its value proposition is dramatically different: Papa can’t compete with Grandma’s special sauce, her decades-long relationships with local families, and the comfort of knowing Grandma herself will almost always be waiting for you behind the counter.

We can provide the relationships and the experience that a corporate entity cannot: We don’t have the turnover that corporate does, and that enhances our bond with our patients: They want to see the same faces every time they come in, and they’re not going to find that at their local Aspen Dental.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Even if corporate dentistry can attract them with convenience, the patients will eventually wise up to the fact that the bottom line will always be profits, and they will take their business elsewhere.

# Embrace the Fact That You've Got to Step Up Your Game

We also think there's an upside to corporate dentistry in that it makes everyone step up his or her game: That's actually good for you, good for your team, good for the patient; and, frankly, for dentistry:

Don't let the fear crush you: let it be a motivator: Craig's concern over corporate fueled the vision behind his current practice model and made him consider what he stood for, beyond just making money: It encouraged him to manifest a better vision and a better future for his business.

But you can't just copy corporate either: If you're thinking about starting a low-quality, aggregate-of-ten dental office and attempting to sell it as a mini Dental Service Organization, stop right now. You won't be able to beat these practices at their own game. You have to use your distinct advantage to beat them: the high-quality experience that comes from investing in patients, rather than just returns.

# Consider Making Corporate Work for You

There's nothing wrong with getting your beak wet in a corporate office: If you can learn the ins and outs of running
---
# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION /S WAY OVERRATED

a business on someone else s dime rather than making the costly mistakes inherent to the on-the-job training you get from immediately opening up Your own shop, we say, go for it. Just keep this in mind: although 85 percent of recruits leave within two years of joining a corporate practice, the vast majority of those who make it past the two-year mark - 95 percent - stay on for the rest of their careers.

Those who do leave before the corporate brainwashing takes full effect are relieved to be out of an environment where everything is predicated on profit rather than on the patient. We also know a lot of dentists who got into the profession for the potential of entrepreneurship - the ability to express their own visions - and corporate can't hold a candle to that innate drive.

# The World According to Corporate:

# Are You Considered Profitable?

One of the many reasons dentists don’t want to acknowledge that their practice is actually a business is because we are the labor; and rather than treating ourselves as such; we just take whatever sinks to the bottom. The result is that it's possible to completely mismanage a practice and then work a little harder to make it all seem worthwhile.

If you were to sell, corporate would pay you outright for your practice - maybe 70 to 100 percent of one year's top-line revenue, and then give you a low-level portion of your personal collections, say 20 to 25 percent:

67
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

If you were paid as an associate today; would your practice still be profitable? Here’s how to figure it out:

Determine your individual yearly collections. Deduct 30 percent - the national average for associate compensation - and see what’s left over: That’s your entrepreneurial profit. That’s your compensation for running a business. If it’s negative, you don’t have one. If it’s positive, congratulations, something’s working - but how much of a profit do you have?

If those numbers need to be improved and you want to continue working for yourself we suggest starting with the people who should be a top priority: your patients. And that means serving them better by giving them what they’ve come to expect from any and all businesses: a consumer-centric approach:

# Provide the Uber Experience or Prepare to Go Extinct

The biggest threat to the solo practitioner is not necessarily corporate. Instead, the experience game is getting intense, and you need to do whatever it takes to participate in the culture that the Amazons and Ubers have built: They’ve made the consumer the center of the universe, and to be really successful; you have to do so as well.

Although Craig’s father may have been able to hang his shingle and watch the patients roll in, that’s not the case anymore. You can’t keep doing the same thing and expect different results.
---
# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION IS WAY OVERRATED

If you don't have a strategy, you're going to get your ass handed to you by anyone and everyone—corporate included:

If you're coasting, it's time to get to work. If you keep bankers' hours or you close up shop when you go on vacation, you could very well be at risk. But this is what we've been talking about all along: evolving your practice into a higher-level value proposition means you can live free of fear.

The most important quality of a business is flexibility. You may have started your practice with one thing in mind, but the times, or your community's needs, or your own interests may demand that you make some changes.

If you're getting bad reviews on the regular or losing people to the big corporate box down the block, something's not working, and you need to switch it up. People—millennials especially—are expecting you to work for them. After all, they almost can't remember a time when their groceries weren't delivered to their door on demand. If you don't adapt to that expectation in some capacity, we're going to get left behind.

Maybe that means extending your hours or services so patients don't have to take off work to see you. Perhaps adding more providers under one roof so your people aren't experiencing the anxiety and time suck that come with seeing a series of doctors in different locations for one relatively simple procedure. Maybe it's opening another office so that you're...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

close to those who need you, or even just making sure that your waiting room is as clean and comfortable as possible.

Change your offerings; change your providers. Constantly be open to mixing it up to make it work. That's what corporate is doing: They're looking at market factors, location, patient demographics - the things likely than not, you aren't looking at. Corporate is not opening an office in a particular location just because it's where they grew up, or doing high-fee dentistry in a blue-collar town; they do significant economic and demographic research on which areas need and can afford dental offices.

But it will take passion. Dreams are free, but the hustle is sold separately: If you don't have that drive, if you don't want to do it, then guess what? You're in luck: you'll probably make more money on your sale than you could have previously. Thank you for that, corporate dentistry.

So, if you're burnt out, hate your practice, and don't feel like putting up the energy to convert it? Then sell. That's our advice.

Cottage industry is not destroyed. If you want it, it's there but the playing field is much more competitive. Corporate will take out the lowest-hanging fruit, so buy into the reality that you're running a business and do it to the best of your ability.
---
# CORPORATE DENTISTRY: THE DISRUPTION IS WAY OVERRATED

You have to lead like a CEO and market like a marketer; in addition to being an awesome dentist; Part of that is complementing the long-term relationships that are a key part of the solo practice with the on-demand access and services all consumers have come to expect: It's setting yourself apart: If that doesn't scare you, you're going to kick ass. As a practice owner; you can—and should—embrace a start-up mentality that allows you to try new things and fail fast; after all, your team is no doubt leaner than any corporate team.

If you're ready to sell, or to find a corporate office in your favorite Idaho ski town and shred more than you work; we wish you the best of luck and commend you on your self-awareness:

But if you're ready and willing to buckle down and keep working to truly bulletproof your practice, join us in the twenty-first century and let's get your social media in shape.

# Chapter 6

# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

Either pay someone to craft a compelling story for you or be remarkable enough that people are willing to tell it for free:

Dr. Craig Spodak

The landscape is polluted with messaging: Our societal conventional wisdom used to be that consumers had to hear your message seven or eight times before they absorbed it, but studies show that number has now become seventeen to twenty. Because the media have become so sensationalistic, people are also highly skeptical of everything they see, hear, and read.

Traditional advertising is dead, and many have turned to complex marketing strategies to make waves in a very crowded.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

You've probably heard that social media is a key part of those marketing strategies—and the key to boosting your visibility. But the idea that you will be able to cut through the clutter and reach more people by peppering the landscape with more noise is inherently flawed. No one’s going to listen to you just because you're loud.

Dentists tell us all the time that their social media isn’t working: They’re putting out what they imagine to be great offers all the time, but nobody’s taking them. This is a huge misstep. Social media is not a megaphone for sales; it’s a venue for entertainment, escape, and story.

Although traditional advertising is always pushing out a message, social media is meant to pull. It’s about building engagement. And while you can craft whatever kind of ad campaign you want, social media will only amplify the culture you already have.

Why? Because the only credible voice is that of the consumer. People won’t even buy a five-dollar nail clipper without reading reviews—thanks, in large part, to Amazon’s influence. We spend twenty minutes researching something that costs less than a sandwich because it’s not the money that matters; it’s social credibility. That’s what people care about nowadays.

That means every brand—yours included—is filtered through the consumer. It’s absorbed, digested, and regurgitated on review sites like Google and Yelp.
---
# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

control of your brand. Instead, its now developed outside of your office, and your community authors your story:

Your website could broadcast that you pride yourself on taking your time with each patient; that your practice is clean and beautiful, that you're the best practitioner in town, but if you have 1.4 stars on Yelp and 1.2 on Google, you're dead. It doesn’t matter what you say: People will think your website content is fake, even your before-and-after photos. It's the reviews that bring them in.

We're starting here because this is crucial: if you have a shitty practice, it doesn’t matter what you do on social media. That reality is bound to come through. Put it this way: either you're spending money on infrastructure, on your team; and on creating a welcoming environment; or you're spending it on a flashy advertising campaign to cover up the bland, nondescript experience you’re offering: You already know which side we’re on, so let’s start with the ground rules of good social media.

# Do It Yourself or Don't Do It at All

About ten years ago, Peter was on stage lecturing to a group of dentists about marketing: He remembers telling them, as clear as day, "Social media doesn’t really have a place in dentistry: Talk about history having to prove you wrong."

Fast-forward ten years, and about 30 percent of his marketing budget is designated for social media.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Embarrassing in hindsight, but back then, people in our world were outsourcing all their social media activity to agencies, and it just looked terrible:

If you put an outside agency in charge of your channels, you'll wind up with the same canned content as the next guy: GIFs of Garfield flossing post-lasagna, a giant smiling tooth begging you not to forget your next appointment, and bullshit like that. The internet is already clogged enough with dumb crap; it doesn't need your clip art. And the first thing we do when that pops up in our feed is unfriend, unlike, junk or unfollow you. You know why? Because time is our most valuable commodity and you just stole five seconds, adding nothing of value to them.

The same goes for the review-posting feature on review-gathering software systems. These programs automatically pick up any positive new reviews and broadcast them via your Facebook feed. They just annoy people; and before you know it, unfollow, you're gone. Don't do this.

Your social media is meant to display your authentic self and if that's not how you're using it, it's not going to work.

Craig's and Peter's social media accounts are totally different from each other because they are different people with different practices. For insight into the content we push out via our social media channels, check out Spodak Dental Group and Atlanta Dental Spa on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
---
# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

Demonstrate your individuality—your own unique selling proposition. Make it genuine and make it authentic, and you’ll be ahead of the game:

# Get Help from Your Team

While social media should be done in-house, the responsibility shouldn't fall on the doctor; who's probably the worst suited person for the job. If you have anyone on your team who's under age thirty-nine, we guarantee you have some social media experts right under your own roof and you should enlist their help: People play on their phones all day long; why not have them leverage those skills for the benefit of the practice?

In Peter's office, everyone takes responsibility for a week of social media production, sharing the load of content generation: This not only results in the development of diverse and engaging material, but also gives patients a chance to become familiar with everyone in the office.

We should note, if you're one of the hundreds of dentists we've seen in Facebook chats asking for help getting employees to stop playing on their phones, abort that mission right now. We've seen a ton of creative solutions, from having employees check in their phones when they arrive at work to giving warnings and even firing over phone use. That's a really bad idea because you're treating them like children:

In Craig's practice, using cellphones is not only allowed, but also encouraged. In fact, if you don't have your phone...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Your person, you're actually in trouble. Team members use their personal devices to post to the practice's social media accounts. Members are always 'checking in at the office, which actually boosts the practice's rank on Google: Everyone uses an office-wide private Facebook page to communicate any urgent information. Having a smartphone handy also allows team members to snap photos of themselves or the doctors with patients, enhancing the office's friendly, family-like environment.

It's an open and free atmosphere, and with that freedom comes the reality that, yes, people may play around on their personal accounts, but you can't control that anyway; it's just the world we live in. You have to pick your battles, and if you're fighting that one, you're bound to lose. This brings us back to the fact that people don't want to be managed; they want to be led.

# Choose Your Channels Wisely

While there are many different ways to push out content, you don't want to waste your time with channels that won't serve you.

Twitter doesn't really have a place in our game. It's all text-based, and things move so fast that your tweets will quickly get lost in the shuffle.

Snapchat is really for the twenty-five-and-under set, so unless that's who you're trying to reach, don't bother with it.
---
# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

We recommend focusing on Instagram as a primary channel, followed by Facebook. Both avenues provide plenty of room for quality visual content and interaction with your community. Keeping it simple will also make it easier to maintain everything:

To that end, a software program like Hootsuite (www.hootsuite.com) will aggregate all of your channels, making content management and engagement monitoring easy:

# Add Value, Not Traffic

People turn to social media for engagement and escape, so keep that in mind as you plan your posts. If you're posting stuff without rhyme or reason—a Garfield here; an anthropomorphic tooth there—you may think you're helping your cause, but it's actually self-sabotage:

A quick but crucial tip: regular people don't like to see teeth without the context of someone's face. There's a reason Facebook won't let you post a paid ad that contains just teeth: because it's fucking ugly to everyone except dentists!

If you want to build a dental audience, great; go for as many retracted before and afters as you can, but everyone else is scared of that shit: Those photos look like close-ups of the Predator.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

# Think Visually

Anything visual works on social media ~videos especially; You dont need much to make an awesome video testimonial. We live in the era of reality TV, and when Keeping Up with the Kardashians is the number-one rated show on television, we dont expect refined videography. Were OK with shaky cameras. It actually makes things more credible. Lots of staged reality shows eschew tripods and balancing cameras to get that amateurish look; so you definitely dont have to have a thousand-dollar media budget to make testimonials work:

For example, #TestimonialTuesday, Craig posted a video of a patient named Lisa who came to his office after twenty years of avoiding the dentist: She quickly got emotional, explaining that the experience had been life changing: When she first arrived, she didnt even want Craig to look in her mouth: "I was afraid you were going to hurt me;" she says, 'but you never hurt me. You and your team only did things that have helped me. I'm eternally grateful to you for your patience and your tolerance and your guidance, and for talking me through every single step of this, because if I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have done this.' The fact that it was taken on an iPhone with the front desk in the background doesnt detract from its power; to which its 7,800 views attest:

You can achieve a similar result. Simply smartphone grab a and find out what people love about your office.

Patients compliment you, immediately ask whether they mind going on video and repeating what they just said. Video comes with implied consent; if they agree to be videotaped, their message is yours to use (we're not offering legal advice here, so make sure to check that this is the case).

A good video on social media can even serve as a recruitment tool, helping you find and hire people who fit your office ethos. Displaying the type of talent you have will help attract the type of people you want:

# Go for Real

Celebrate a teammate's fifth anniversary with you on social media. Congratulate your hygienist on his or her new baby, or recognize a patient who's been coming to your practice for twenty years. Good social media highlights the humanity in us all, and people are guaranteed to connect with that kind of content:

# Encourage Interaction

Ask questions: request that people like or comment on your posts--anything to further interact with your followers. That's how you'll keep them on board.

Don't be afraid to move away from the subject of dentistry here. Motivational quotes, cool photos—anything interesting works. We also make sure to watermark our images, so if they're shared, they're attributed to us (apps like Watermark Photo make the process super simple).

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

# Consistency Is Key

If your reception area is stocked with ten-year-old copies of National Geographic, you're better off not having magazines. Similarly, if your last Facebook post is from two years ago, get rid of your account: Either do it right or don't do it at all.

Don't go dark for a few weeks or a month and then blitz your audience with nine posts at once. Commit to one post a week—or more if you can handle it—and expand from there. It's also a good idea to time your posts; certain times of the day or week will earn more engagement than others will. For Facebook, that's Thursdays around 1 p.m. Instagram works well most of the time—Monday through Friday—but 8 a.m. posts garner the most views. Plan posts out in advance and make a schedule for deployment: That will help keep you on track and ensure you're not under- or overdoing it.

# Hashtags Are Your Friend

Including hashtags in every post is a great way to aggregate followers. You can search Instagram for popular words or phrases and use those to increase your visibility. For example, something simple as '#smile' has around 250 million posts right now. Think of the audience you could reach by just adding a few key words. You can also create a hashtag for your practice and ask patients and team members alike to use it when they are talking up your office.
---
# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

To make things more efficient; consider creating a core list of hashtags that you can use for each post and just tweak them slightly based on the content:

# Make Your Patients Part of Your Network

It's one thing to take a selfie with a patient and send it through to all the people who already follow us, but more than likely, those who are seeing it are already customers.

However; if you can get a patient to post on his or her own account, you've gained access to the holy grail of social media. The average person has 318 friends, meaning, if you can get just one person to post about you, you've just scaled your exposure 318 times. It's also much more credible when someone else shares your message; it demonstrates that you've already been vetted.

Check-ins are huge: When someone checks in at your office, that person is broadcasting that you're his or her dentist. Offering incentives will get this patient excited about doing you a favor; Craig gives free tubes of whitening gel to those who check in (you can include this in your marketing budget). As of this writing, his office has had 5,473 check-ins and counting. People also love to help out; so don't be afraid to ask.

Reviews on third-party sites like Yelp have a similar impact, and wowing your patients with the incredible culture and service you're building is a surefire way to get them to sing your praises:
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

If you can leverage a social influencer—someone with significant reach in your community—his or her post will go that much further: Tony Robbins is a longtime patient and friend of Craig's, and when Tony posted about Spodak Dental Group on Instagram, the photo got almost twenty-five hundred likes, not to mention exposure to Tony's more than 1.8 million followers.

If you have a patient with internet clout, do whatever it takes to get him or her to be an ambassador for your practice. If there are influencers in your community who are already patients, consider offering to treat them for free: The payoff could be massive. Social influencing is one of the cheapest and most effective marketing strategies there is.

Things like check-ins and posts won't just get you noticed by your patients' friends; they'll also be noticed by Google, increasing your search engine ranking: While no one knows the exact ingredients of Google's secret sauce, we do know that the algorithm is built to determine and rank social relevance: the truest measure of who you are. We use it all the time. We don't talk to a dentist without first checking him or her out: You can't control what people say about you, so make it work to your advantage.

# Keep Your Personal Accounts Clean

If you've created an attractive culture, your patients will want to be part of it: And one very important aspect of that.
---
# SOCIAL MEDIA IS A DAILY GRIND, AND THAT'S JUST GREAT

People are not just buying into what you do; they’re also buying into who you are as a person. Before they plunk down twenty, thirty, or forty grand on their teeth; they will want to follow you and see what you’re up to. Plus, in the age of Google, everyone does his or her research, and the search engine tends to pull up social media profiles first:

Be aware that everything you put up is going to be seen by current or potential patients. Keep it clean and definitely political. Remind your team that if members' profiles aren’t set to private, the team needs to do the same; because they’re representatives of the practice, too.

Social media is not traditional advertising, but it is an extension of your brand. Keep in mind that it will only magnify—not alter—your existing culture.

As you implement these strategies, remember that it’s not about putting up posts; it’s about building engagement: The only metric that matters here is interaction: If you have forty posts up and nobody has liked a single one, you’ve got to take that down because you’re intruding on their feed rather than contributing to it: They value that little piece of real estate; and they don’t want to see, “Some asshole cut me off this morning, SMH.” We tune out people who consistently bring shitty news into our lives.

The best ever: CARE

Gary Vaynerchuk

'Traditional marketing in dentistry and everywhere else focuses on the mechanics: It's all about how much exposure you can get, how much you can penetrate the market: But the culture, the experience, and the qualities that set you apart and add value for your patients are often neglected. The truth is, it's about what you offer; not how you offer it:

Marketing is not the differentiating factor: We've said it before, and we'll say it again: you can't compensate for a shitty practice with some marketing hack: If you're struggling; promise there's itty bitty copy of Facebook ad we not some W

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Marketing gimmick out there that will solve your problems. Like social media, marketing only amplifies whatever you’ve already got going on.

We don’t engage in traditional marketing strategies; we haven’t seen any data or found any evidence ourselves that proves they’re still effective. Your face on a bus is not going to attract the patients you want: Instead, we let our practices do the talking, and we invest in honing and strengthening their voices. You’ve probably tapped into some of our techniques yourself; others may not seem like marketing at all.

Below, I’ll run through a few marketing strategies—the regular suspects and more out-of-the-box ideas—and tell you what we think is worth it and what’s a waste of your time.

# Spray and Pray: Print and Radio

Think about what’s going on in society today: If you were to walk through an airport right now, you wouldn’t see many heads buried in magazines or newspapers. Instead, everyone is looking down at a cell phone, a tablet, or a laptop: You need to go where the attention is, and if you think print is where it’s at, you’re wrong: Print ads are pretty much dead.

About fifteen years ago, about 50 percent of Peter’s marketing budget was earmarked for print; but today, it’s miniscule. There are certain markets where print may be applicable, but certainly not for direct ROI.
---
# VALUE-BASED MARKETING AND THE LAW OF RECIPROCITY

Use them for branding or exposure, go for it: They can help you make some noise in that crowded media landscape, and they can occasionally build consumer confidence by making you a familiar face. We each do one print ad a month, but it's more in the spirit of community than anything else.

Radio, another common route, is not only expensive; it's ineffective. Radio and print ads are what we call spray and pray: you blast out your message indiscriminately and hope someone interested in your product or service just happens to be listening. Why pepper the marketplace with advertising that's just going to be drowned out? Why spend so many dollars reaching people who aren't looking for what you're selling?

On top of that, people don't want massive, one-size-fits-all anything anymore; they're looking for products, services, and content that speak directly to their needs and interests. The world is becoming more hyper-niched and hyper-focused every day: As a result, big-box companies like Sports Authority are going out of business. This reality makes spray and pray even more of a waste of time.

It's also impossible to track. You can't know whether those who do end up coming through your doors saw you in a magazine, on the radio, or on TV, unless they tell you: If they hear you on the radio and Google you a week later; all you get is that lead from Google. The old adage of advertising is that it works 50 percent of the time; but the problem is, there's no...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

figure out which 50 percent to cut out: And the more way to un-Sports-Authority-like the world becomes, the harder it is to reach the audience you need.

People can source exactly what they’re looking for online; they can orchestrate the content: Would you rather spend five thousand dollars a month blanketing the airwaves or pages, hoping to reach someone at the very moment he or she is considering Invisalign, or hit people who are searching for exactly what you are providing?

Why not spend the same amount you’ve budgeted for print and radio ads on an ultra-niched pay-per-click or SEO campaign; where you can actually target people actively looking for someone just like you?

# Paid Ads

Cost per thousand, or CPM, indicates the amount of money it will take to reach a thousand people: With print or radio, you may reach thousands of individuals, but only a small percentage of those people are going to be interested in what you’re offering;

However, with more laser-focused, niche marketing, you can reach people who are seeking your product right then. Your CPM may be more, but every single person you’re reaching is actually interested in your product: You’re speaking to an auditorium of people who are asking about Invisalign as
---
# VALUE-BASED MARKETING AND THE LAW OF RECIPROCITY

opposed to a group hunting for antique furniture or a pet groomer; people who may or may not be considering doing something about their smiles.

Using paid ads online does just that: When people search for a particular keyword, your business pops up. You choose the search terms you want to link to your ad. You’re then charged when someone clicks on the link to your website.

Something like Google AdWords is good, but it’s pretty expensive unless you really know the product and have a strong strategy. For example, dentists will often use the term "dentist." We suggest choosing more targeted keywords (think "laser dentist") instead of the less specific "dentist" or "teeth whitening Sacramento," increasing the likelihood that those searching for a service are actually looking for a provider like you, while reducing your cost per click (CPC).

We’re also fans of Facebook ads and Instagram ads. They require creative copy and good development; whether in the form of video or digital design; but when done right, they’re definitely effective.

# Invest in Your Website

When people arrive at your website, which you’ve spent tons of money driving people to, what are they looking at? Lots of dentists slap something up and check that box: website: done—but if your site is full of clip art or stock images...
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

If there are no before and afters; no pictures of the doc or team, and no educational components, what value is your website adding to your practice?

People become phobic about going to the dentist because they don't want to get hurt: The prospect of going into an unknown office filled with strangers and scary or possibly even outdated or dirty equipment freaks a lot of people out. Your website can help mitigate some of these fears. Remove those barriers, because your competition might not be doing so.

You can use your website to welcome someone in, to introduce yourself and your team, and to educate him or her on what you do and how you do it: The more you can show potential patients digitally, the better off you're going to be. You also don't have to spend thousands of dollars to create a beautiful site. Companies like Squarespace (squarespace.com) and WordPress (wordpress.com) offer tons of high-quality templates and easy customization at affordable prices.

# The Art of the Recapture

The easiest mark is always the person who is already part of your practice or who has been part of it: That individual chose you before for a reason, so he or she is more likely to do so again.

When someone goes inactive - when more than eighteen months and a day have passed since the last time you saw...
---
# VALUE-BASED MARKETING AND THE LAW OF RECIPROCITY

him or her - you need to figure out what's going on. Does that person just need a reminder? Did you drop the ball? Did the patient?

This is especially important because; as dentists, we want to look at practice valuations, and the number one thing someone asks when thinking about buying your practice is, "How many active patients do you have?" Keeping our patients active increases our practice's value:

If we haven't seen someone in eighteen months, we'll send a T-shirt with a note letting the patient know we'd love to see him or her again and welcome a return visit.

# The Law of Reciprocity

The Law of Reciprocity, the concept that if you give someone something of value, he or she will be compelled to return the favor; also comes into play here: When we receive something valuable - whether it's great content, an educational video on a website, or a small but meaningful gift - we can't help but want to give back. It's just human nature. For us in particular, people's response usually takes the form of patronizing our practices. The Law of Reciprocity is a key aspect of both our marketing strategies.

Giving new patients gifts when they enter our practice welcomes them to the family and helps set the tone of reciprocity. They know that we plan to give them value in the form of awesome dental treatment; awesome website content;
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

and even personalized gifts from time to time—whether it's a onesie for their new baby or a chew toy for their dog—and, in exchange, they become loyal patients.

The catch is, you can't give anything away with the expectation that 'I'll get something back. It's inauthentic, and you will be perceived as such. Consumers, being the great bullshit detectors they are, will absolutely pick up on that:

# Don't Fall in Love with Yourself or Your Service; Fall in Love with Your Patient

Dentists are always caught up in the idea that patients care about what they know. When we're building our practices, we take a ton of continuing education courses to refine our craft: But patients underestimate the variation in skills from dentist to dentist. They figure that if you're licensed and legal and you're allowed to open up a store; you're probably OK. So, they go with the person they bond and connect with the most.

There are incredibly successful dentists who make tons of money despite that they are actually very poor clinicians. It's almost a case of the emperor's new clothes; patients like the guy so much that his lack of skill is irrelevant: We literally cringe when they show us his work.

If you want to add more value for patients, you have to add it in ways they can perceive: Just touting that you graduated.
---
# VALUE-BASED MARKETING AND THE LAW OF RECIPROCITY

from Harvard or that you got some extra training isn’t very useful. They don’t care that much: This is not to say that you shouldn’t refine your craft, because it’s obviously important for your patients and for the profession that you operate at the highest possible level. But remember; it’s not about what you know; it’s about how much you care.

On that note; one of the most significant ways patients evaluate hospitals is not on their perception of the quality of care, but on how well doctors and nurses get along: That’s what drives business to hospitals. Similarly, patients will observe how you treat your team: If you’re being an asshole to your assistants and throwing your instruments, your business is going to evaporate. Fall in love with your team: Treat team members with respect; so they can nurture your patients as well.

# The "Thank You" Economy

We both employ a great strategy that’s seldom used. When done right, it can make you millions of dollars. It’s simple, but it’s not easy:

It’s this: actually care about people.

We are both strong believers in the 'thank you' concept coined by entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk: That concept is predicated on focusing on our existing patients, showing appreciation for their loyalty, and making them our.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

feel like theyre part of our family. And its all part of our marketing budget: When you're expecting a baby and your dentist sends you a onesie, that's your dentist for life. The cost of that strategic move is so much less than placing a print ad in any magazine.

In his book The Thank You Economy, Gary Vaynerchuk shares a poignant story that demonstrates the impact of actually caring: Gary was selling wine through Wine Library and he began following one of his customers on social media. Everything the customer posted was about the Broncos; he was a total Broncos fanatic. So Gary went on eBay, bought a signed jersey, and sent it to him. He then waited for a response. He checked in with his team every day, hoping to hear something from the customer: Nothing came.

Then, about three weeks later, a huge order for Burgundy came in from a brand-new buyer: The order was from a friend of the Broncos fan. He had referred the new buyer to Gary's website. Along with it was a note. By the way; 'I love the Patriots.'

The whole premise of the thank-you economy is to go really deep with your patient base. Be engaged in their lives, because the patients are engaging you in theirs. Peter has a full-time intern following people on social media so that the practice can pick up on meaningful moments in patients' lives and choose tailored gifts when they're called for.
---
# VALUE-BASED MARKETING AND THE LAW OF RECIPROCITY

Peter's team also monitors his patient base. At one point, the team realized that a patient's parents had both become ill around the same time: She was clearly overwhelmed and stressed by the situation, so the team decided to send her family meals for a few nights to lessen a bit of the burden they knew she was experiencing.

Shortly after, the team received a note. The patient said the meals—that small gesture—really helped her make it through such a trying time. Because of the office's gift, she didn't have to worry about feeding her family: She said that the team had no idea of the impact they'd had: The gift meant everything.

There are no boundaries here. Just because you're a dentist doesn't mean you're limited to sending a toothbrush with a bow on it: Don't be afraid to get creative with your care and do things that will really make a difference.

The world has changed: The old gimmicks—"the best," "30 minutes or less," and "$50 off your next visit"—don't hold up anymore, no matter what medium you're using. Someone will always be willing to offer $100 off. There are people who will pay new patients to come in.

Instead, know that value attracts value—and a customer who appreciates you is going to spend a lot more and follow the course of treatment you recommend, than someone who came in to get an exam for a dollar.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

The new marketing is a compelling story, a meaningful gesture, paying it forward, and engaging in the thank-you economy:

Add value, add value, add value, and then; after that; you've earned the right to ask for business—but not before:

It's also the unexpected gesture that makes the magic. That's what lets them know you really care—and caring will make your work mean something: It will help get you to that fulfillment we're all seeking:

# WHAT YOU DO SPEAKS SO LOUDLY; THE PATIENT CANT HEAR A WORD YOURE SAYING

The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives: ~Tony Robbins

If you feel like you're an awesome dentist; but you're not enrolling, you're not getting referrals, or you're not where you want to be no matter how strong your skills are, often communication is the missing link: what you do speaks SO loudly that the patient can't hear a word you're saying:

Dentists are engineers, and we talk like it. Eighty percent of us speak like the technicians we are, which probably resonates.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

with the 20 percent of the general population who are engineers as well: It's the 80/20 Rule in reverse.

But what about everybody else? Most of your patients probably don't understand what you're saying, which can leave them looking for an exit route:

You may think throwing fistfuls of technical jargon at the person in your chair will show him or her how much you know. But before you go vomiting your exhaustive dental knowledge all over your next victim, take a second. Remind yourself that you're not talking to a dentiform: There's a brain inside and a body attached; and that whole person has inevitably arrived at your office with a fully formed personality and a history of dental experiences that you may or may not know about: He or she may be scared or embarrassed - their primitive brain on high alert:

Recognize the vulnerable position you're putting someone in just by the very nature of your job. Dentistry is very intimate; it requires you to physically enter someone's personal space. To obtain the permission to get in people's faces, you have to make people comfortable. You have to let them know that you're in this together:

When patients are in our chair; we'll actually say it: "We're in this together:" And often, while other dentists spent their appointments shaming them for not flossing or for drinking too many Cokes, we're the glimmer of hope:
---
THE PATIENT CAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING

Quality communication is what sets us—and other successful dentists—apart. Those at the top have mastered the art of communication. They can assess the emotional state of the person in their chair and share information in a way that meets the person where he or she is, manipulating their delivery to make their message absorbable. If you want to make it big, being able to adapt and communicate is not optional.

# How Do You Present?

Are you grumpy-pants all the time? Are you presenting like an awkward robot? If so, that could easily be what's killing your business. Empathy and verbal and physical cues are usually what's lacking: Your verbiage, your approach, and your body language can all prohibit you from doing the dentistry you were trained to do.

The following statement most certainly rings true: People don’t care how much you know until they know you care. Don’t come in like a dictator and expect exceptional results. We’re not saying you don’t care; because of course you do. But if your patient can’t perceive it, if your delivery seems like it’s all about you, if it feels like a sales pitch or looks like a book report; take the time to show him or her you’re a person first and foremost: Be the person you are at a cocktail party. Be the person you are to your eight-year-old daughter:

# A Sexier Proposition Means More Competition

The field is changing: In the '90s, when we were in dental school, medicine was sexy—a la General Hospital—and dentistry was for rejects. People thought of us as the guys who couldn't get into medical school. But when dentistry went through its reform and medical doctors lost their freedom and became slaves to the insurance companies, dentistry got sexier: It's a very different profession today:

Now, people choose the path of dentistry over medicine. We can see why: insurance hasn't really ruined us yet; and while surgeons are hospitals' bitches, shouldering sixteen-hour workdays and all kinds of liability, we're looking at an elective profession with many different modalities. There are more options for dentists and patients alike, and that means you have to up your social skills to be competitive:

It's a travesty when we see a wonderful dentist; at the top of his or her class, who will never really get a chance at bat because of being perceived as socially awkward or weird.

Given the state of the world, people are becoming more skeptical of everyone they interact with; their bullshit detectors are on high alert, even when you're not bullshitting them: That means you have to work even harder to get the permission required for what we do.

But don't let anyone tell you that this stuff can't be learned. Peter is an introvert and a half; His happy place is

# THE PATIENT CAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING

by himself - total solitude. But he recognized early on that his success was going to be predicated on how well he could communicate and empathize, so he put in the work to master patient interactions.

That said, this is not a one-and-done kind of thing, but rather a continual process. In the following pages, we'll give you some fundamental tips on how to begin upping your communication game.

# Depart from the Script

We often see dentists clinging to a script: They'll develop something that works, more or less, and then scale it; using it on every patient who walks through the door:

But a one-size-fits-all approach benefits no one - not to mention that it will leave you feeling like Bill Murray in a dental-centric Groundhog Day: You need to modify your method based on who's in your chair:

You can't possibly know where that person is coming from at any particular moment in time; so it's essential to use the clues he or she provides to tailor your presentation. This starts with cultivating a receptivity to body language and it's something, meaning: For instance; when men are unsure about something, they’ll start whisking their fingers, grabbing at their beard or their face, from cheeks to chin: When a woman is experiencing the same kind of discomfort; her chest will flush, or she’ll start playing.
---
# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

with her hair Or get fidgety: People might cross their arms to protect themselves from an onslaught of information. Just as inpoker; these are tells. You don't need to ask patients how they’re feeling: they are already showing you.

Now you need to determine what could be causing their reactions. Are you moving too fast? Do you need to slow down? Is it what you're saying rather than how you're saying it? Do you need to schedule another appointment to finish the procedure?

We also take steps up front to avoid inducing uneasiness. For starters, we make sure we get eye to eye with people as quickly as possible: Rather than standing above them and ticking off their issues, we take a seat; minimizing the obvious power dynamic.

We don't talk to people while they’re reclined, because there’s no way they’ll be able to focus on what we are saying; When the chair is reclined, the patient is basically doing an isometric abdominal crunch to hear you: They are putting their hand behind their head, trying to lift themselves up, straining their necks. They want to get out of that room as quickly as possible because it’s really fricking uncomfortable. If you can meet patients in a non-dental setting, like a consult room, where you can sit at the same level, do that: But if you can’t, sit them up, take a seat yourself and open up your body language so that you’re face-to-face: That’s going to speak volumes.
---
# THE PATIENT CAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE SAYING

Co-diagnosis allows the patient to participate. When we come in to do a consultation, we’ll put pictures up on the screen and look over the area of concern with him or her: Instead of standing and pointing; we sit down, get shoulder to shoulder; and look at that page or that screen together: We let patients figure out the issue themselves, making our conclusions about the corresponding course of treatment a lot more palatable.

# Adaptation in Action

If the person sitting in front of Peter seems to be like him, he’ll know he or she probably wants to be spoken to in bullet points. So, he’ll give the facts without extra fluff: He’ll actually escalate the cadence of his voice and speak a bit louder: He’ll offer far fewer options than he would to someone who seems more reticent: And it works because that’s what patients like this want: a driver like them, who keeps it straight and forward. When Peter’s done, they’re ready to get started.

If he has someone like his mom in the chair—more touchy-feely, a pathfinder—he’ll take a couple of deep breaths and slow things down, lowering his voice. He’ll shake her hand with both of his to demonstrate his warmth or reciprocate a friendly touch on the arm to cement their connection.

That consultation may take twenty minutes as opposed to the five it would take with a driver; and they may not really get anywhere: He may find out everything there is to know about the patient’s tennis game (which he’ll quickly add to her).

file for personal intel) before he gets to the fact that a crown is needed on number nineteen, but that's all part of the process. And, more importantly, it's what's necessary to make that particular patient feel like she has come to the right place.

# Here are some basic ways to improve Your presentation:

# Don’t Fear Silence

Sometimes dentists are so uncomfortable with the pause after a presentation that they actually talk themselves out of doing the treatment. They just keep going when they should have stopped. Pause after you deliver the information. Let it sink in. Don’t feel the need to fill the silence; it won’t do you any favors.

# Do Some Public Speaking

Eighty percent of what you say isn’t about the words coming out of your mouth. It’s your body language, your tone, your timing, and your empathy. Find a community of people that can judge your delivery holistically: It may be trusted members of your team or even a local public speaking group (Toastmasters International is a great one, and likely has a chapter near you), but no matter who provides the feedback, getting it is bound to be beneficial.

# Learn about Body Language

Understanding body language is a key part of being a good communicator. Buy a book on body language; watch YouTube videos; or seek out information on the subject.
---
# THE PATIENT CAN'T HEAR A WORD YOU'RE Saying

Physical signs people display and what they mean so you can easily decode the responses that take place in your chair.

# Record Yourself in a Consultation or Examination

We can never truly know how others perceive us. Recording yourself will allow you to gain a third-party perspective on how you present firsthand. Watching yourself and noticing any cringeworthy habits will make it a lot easier to self-audit.

# Ask for Advice

Humble yourself in front of your team and ask for advice. Ask the team how your delivery was or how a particular consultation went: Ask whether anyone saw an opportunity that you didn't pick up on, or if you could've done better. You may already be great; but your team can help you be greater: There is always room for more awesome.

# To be successful in dentistry today

You have to have the trifecta: the manual skills, the people skills, and the drive. Lacking one of those key elements is not going to cut it. You need to determine your weaknesses and work on those, because the knockout punch is the one we don’t see.

If you need to strengthen your communication skills, studying up on body language, personality types and how to make yourself more approachable will allow you to do more.

# DOUBLE DOWN: REDEFINING SUCCESS AND FAILURE

Where focus goes; energy flows: ~Tony Robbins

How often do you wake up and ask yourself; "Hmm; what can I invest in today that I know nothing about and have no control over?"

Sounds like a silly question, right? But you might do it more frequently than you think.

If you're investing in a business other than your practice ~say, a frozen yogurt shop or a burger franchise~ or are even day trading, you're missing the boat on a sea of opportunities that could actually be strengthening your unique value proposition as a dentist rather than diluting it.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Dentists have a real advantage in the fact that most states require that dental practices be owned by dentists. That barrier to entry works in your favor: Meanwhile, everyone and their grandma can open up a yogurt shop because one doesn’t have to have a yogurt license to do so. Why would you go outside the context of what you were trained to do—and the much bigger competitors who come with doing this—to make money?

Yet so many of us are compelled to invest in a tangential concept like a car wash or your buddy's restaurant; something we don’t know shit about. We’ll ignore the potential for a substantial ROI on our dental practice and go money parkour in a silly side business: Or, the second our practice becomes profitable, we’ll siphon off that income and put it in the hands of an anonymous broker; unaware of the huge commission he’ll take off the top.

The same goes for selling a practice. So many dentists believe they’ll benefit by shoving whatever they make on the sale into another venture. But if your practice is pulling in more than 5 percent net profit—about what you’ll make in the market—you’re better off keeping your business. Looking at the numbers makes this a logical decision, not an emotional one.

It’s sometimes hard to make that distinction because for many dentists, their practices have come to feel like a treadmill on which they "can’t go any faster." They’re burned out, and they’ve convinced themselves that the only solution is to keep pulling.

# DOUBLE DOWN: REDEFINING SUCCESS AND FAILURE

Dollars out of their practice and putting that money somewhere else so that one day - they can stop doing what they are doing: To make matters worse, dentists are often big spenders. Most of us can't retire by the time we’re sixty-five because we spend too much money; according to the ADA, as of 2015, the average age of retirement for dentists was 68.8, climbing from 66.1 in 2005. That's scary as hell for people who are making an average of two hundred to three hundred grand a year: The paradox is, we see the value in driving a nice car or buying a vacation home or opening a side business, but we can't fathom the value of putting our money where our mouth is - multiple puns intended.

Sure; if your practice needs no further investment, we can understand the benefit of looking into something passive, like real estate. But what boggles our minds is the active investments that dentists are willing to make. They'll man that yogurt shop every weekend, if need be, because they are so anxious to escape dentistry: They don't realize that, from a profit standpoint, dentistry is one of the most lucrative things they can do.

# Recognize That Your Practice Is a Business

When Dr. X is designing his yogurt shop, he'll think to himself; I'll choose a primo location because people will come in.

more often. But when it comes to his practice, he doesn't care that it's in a shitty strip mall in the middle of nowhere. Or; he'll decide, I want the newest equipment and good lighting for my yogurt shop so people will want to hang out and take a selfie or two. But at his practice, he's happy with the crusty dropped ceiling, archaic processes, and the same inconvenient hours he's had for decades.

Why would you work hard only to pull money from the business that has afforded it to you in the first place and then invest that money arbitrarily? And why would you then, to add insult to injury, take more care in creating the various elements of your side hustle?

Our theory is that, in addition to the misery it brings them, many dentists don't actually consider their practice to be a business to begin with: They see it as an extension of themselves. While they think of their yogurt shop as a business, dentists see their practice's income as compensation for their labor:

They think people are coming to them for their skill set alone. They believe their patients don't care about the stale-smelling shag carpeting in the waiting room, the old technology that requires two or three visits for a single crown, or the bumbling team behind the front desk. They don't recognize that the office environment, the technology, and the team might all be ROL. Instead, they are so preoccupied.

with themselves that they can't recognize the vast potential of their practice.

Whereas most business owners see all the different parts that contribute to their success—the facility teams, culture, services, products and branding—many dentists don't: For dentists, it's all about us. And when success and failure occur by the micromillimeter; we become hyper-focused on our own shortcomings rather than looking at our businesses as a whole.

The challenge is to collapse that imagined distinction between your practice and a business—because your practice is a business:

# Don't Fear Failure

Another reason dentists don’t invest in their most valuable resource is because they fear failure. And, unlike our line of work—a science that offers a series of prescribed steps to achieve a desired result—business is more a form of art: You have to be creative in business. You have to be willing to fail and then to scrap whatever's not working and start over.

It frustrates the crap out of dentists that, in business, they can't get that scientifically proven result: Often, once they hit that first tiny business failure, they invest elsewhere.

But the truth is, while many of us are terrified of failure, very few dental practices outright fail—just 2.1 percent: Compare that to restaurants: between 90 and 95 percent fail.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

In the first year: Overall, only 20 percent of new businesses survive past their first year of operation, and only one-third of those businesses make it past their ten-year anniversary. You can see how disproportionately high our safety threshold is. And yet, so many of us take the money that we are making in our secure, stable business - the one that we know most about, with the least competitive influence and the best tax advantages - and put it somewhere much riskier.

Don’t be afraid to fail. Usually, that failure is just accelerated learning: We’ve all made mistakes - some more costly than others - but we’ve learned from them. Once we fail, we learn even more quickly.

Don’t hesitate to throw something away when it’s not working: After a mistake, you don’t walk away the same person; that in itself is worth the cost of the perceived failure. And, as we’ve established, the failure rate in dentistry is actually small - so you have a very slim chance of losing big.

Recently, however, Craig had a really big failure. A bunch of dentists in his practice were complaining that the office was too busy, which is a dream problem to have. He listened to the complaints for long enough that he began trying to slow things down: It worked. His third-quarter profit was half the amount of his second-quarter profit: This loss was a huge lesson.

# DOUBLE DOWN: REDEFINING SUCCESS AND FAILURE

When Craig spoke to a good friend in the business world about his situation, his friend nodded knowingly and said, "You should never apply the brakes to a business." Craig had figured that the practice was so great that he could afford to slow down: But the market will react to your pushing people away: You'll get exactly what you're seeking: If you put it out there that you're too busy and things are just too much, the market will respond. Don't forget that you're blessed with the opportunity you have. When you feel overwhelmed, double and triple down:

# Where Focus Goes, Energy Flows

In his book, Killing Sacred Cows: Overcoming the Financial Myths That Are Destroying Your Prosperity, Peters buddy Garrett B. Gunderson wrote about the faulty logic of blindly dumping money into things we can't control. Instead of looking to invest elsewhere, you should be doubling down: Don't skimp on your office design. Spend the money needed to hire the best team. These are great places to invest.

Tony Robbins said, "Where focus goes, energy flows." That means your mindset—whether it's all about that fear of failure or your efforts toward a particular end goal—is going to be more of an indicator of your success than any other metric will be. Also, it feels great to commit to your practice in a real way: Peter gets excited about the things he needs to make.

# Turn Your Have Tos into Get Tos

In 2006 or 2007, when the stock market was booming Craig's dad said to him, "I could retire today and walk away from all this. The stock market has done so well; I don't need to work anymore.

"What do you want to do?" Craig asked.

"Well, you know;" replied; "I really enjoy working: I don't think I'd ever want to retire. I can; but I don't want to."

Then, two years later; the stock market collapsed, and they had another conversation.

Craig; "I'm going to have to work forever:" he said, "That's good;" Craig replied, "because that's what you wanted to do anyway."

You have to change your have tos to get tos. You don't really have to work anymore. You could move to Cambodia with $50,000, and that would probably roll you out for ten-plus years. You're only as strapped as you feel.

Its a privilege to be in the profession we rein, but its up to you to decide that you feel that way: Making that decision requires going all in.

# Winter Is Coming

We can cite so many examples of dentists who - during the Great Recession believed the news that it was fire and brimstone out there. They reacted by laying off their team members and paring down their schedules to trim costs. Then the disaster became a self-fulfilling prophecy for them.

Remember; economies are cyclical: they go through all of the seasons. When summer is here, everyone is a rock star: Right now, dentistry is booming: Dental spending relates to the S&P 500 Index: When the markets are booming, dental spends are booming: But we all have to remember that winter is coming:

Winter excites the crap out of people like us because we know the other guys are scared. That's when we double down. We buy real estate; buy practices, buy equipment; and leverage our relationships because we know the economy operates in a cycle.

We understand that business is constant innovation, and with that understanding comes a sense of urgency to continually redefine our practices. When most dentists think they've reached the summit; we feel like we're in the valley with so.

digest information much to do. Were trying to chew up and as quickly as possible:

Like many dentists, if you asked us how we redoing, we’d say we don’t feel like we’re really killing it. We’re very hungry:

The difference between those who are successful and those who aren’t is not their talent but their hunger: Hungry people will always find a way to eat: When the winter comes and the food is scarce, the hungriest people really show up.

The people who win in this game are the ones who are hyper-focused on adding value. How can you invest in your practice to make everything about offering the best experience for your patients?

You have to think abundantly. You can’t ever shrink your way to greatness. Don’t fear failure. Don’t be scared of scarcity or of competition. Who gives a shit if someone opens up a practice across the street? There’s plenty for everybody as long as you are doing it right: Just be better, and you’ll do fine.

Auditing yourself should be a constant: How is your facility? How is your team? How is your appearance? Spend money on your level of care and your patient experience and don’t look to cut corners to maximize profitability:

If you’re worried about spending $30,000 to redo your lobby and redriving S-Class, sell your S-Class. Go get you an.

If you’re still tempted to buy a business that you don’t have to work in, acquire a dental practice that you don’t have to work in. You’re far more qualified to do that than you are to become a yogurt guru or pizza guru or even a day-trading guru.

Rather than frittering your energy away with tangential distractions, we challenge you to address any shortcomings you have in your own little ecosystem. Invest in what you’re doing: Can you scale? Can you reinvest in your team, your culture, your CE?

If you take a macro view, you’ll see that these investments will yield a much better return than putting your money into something you have no control over: They’ll probably make you happier; too.

# WHAT THE PRACTICE OF TOMORROW WILL LOOK LIKE

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.

~Eleanor Roosevelt

When you go to a Mercedes dealership, the salesperson doesn’t have to describe the look of the car; the smell of the leather; or the way the car handles to make a sale; he or she just throws you the keys: When you’re done with the test-drive, you’re ready to liquidate your 401(k) or borrow from Aunt Sally to get that car—which you may not have had any intention of buying when you walked in—because you were able to experience firsthand what it feels like to drive a Mercedes.

# THE BULLET PROOF PRACTICE

Cosmetic dentists have never been able to let patients test-drive their future smiles—at least not in a fast, accurate way. Instead, to be phenomenal dentists, cosmetic dentists have always had to have the skills not only to accomplish the work successfully, but also to describe as emotionally and passionately as possible the final result: the look and feel of a top-of-the-line smile.

The guys who were best at making sales had this contagious energy. They were able to evoke the emotional impact that a new smile would bring. Their enthusiasm was so electrifying that patients signed up, sight unseen. The consumer was essentially buying a Mercedes without ever having test-driven it: The dentist could really picture, and that was enough.

With technology like Digital Smile Design (DSD), now there’s a patient a realistic preview of what he or she is going to look like when the work is complete. In an hour, it gives a preview. With technology like that, you don’t have to be particularly charismatic or convincing to convey the value of what you’re selling: The technology does the work itself. People are able to see and feel their smiles before ever spending their first nickel. With that type of value, even Jeffrey Dahmer could enroll patients with Digital Smile Design. Technology has arrived in dentistry, and it’s changing the way we play the game.

We know: we’ve all become leery of statements like this one. For years, the American Dental Association and other big...

# WHAT THE PRACTICE OF TOMORROW WILL LOOK LIKE

Governing bodies of dentistry have been beating the drum that; with the rise of new technology the era of the solo practice is on its way out: We’ve been hearing it since the late '90s. We're also wary because we've been sold so many gadgets over the years, gadgets like DIAGNOdent; that are meant to change everything: When they don’t work; the weight of all those warnings is diminished:

You may be thinking to yourself, They’ve been saying this shit for twenty years, and I don’t feel much of a difference: But the sense of safety you’re feeling is false: Everything happens slowly until it’s sudden: If you looked at the first Ford Model T that rolled off the line, you would have said, 'Shit; I’ll stick to my horse: That thing smoked and banged, and people laughed at it: The first cellphone sucked too; it was like a piece of luggage with a cord:

But when it comes to technology; it’s not a question of if it works; it’s when. Now, finally, the shit works. With eleven new corporate practices opening every day in America, and the reality that technology begets technology, the revolution is coming: It will be here before you know it:

Consider the case of Uber: It wasn’t really successful until people understood it—and now that consumers have experienced the real convenience it provides, they don’t want to take taxis anymore: We can never go back. When governments try to block Uber from coming to certain areas, as

theydid in South Florida for a bit; thepublicwon t tolerate it; Constituents overwhelmed the email servers of every senator and congressperson in the area, saying, "You cant do this. You have to let them in."

The tidal wave is rising in dentistry, too, whether you can see it yet or not. Here are our takes on technology's disruption of dentistry and what it means for all of us:

# Craig's Take

Dentistry has gone through more changes in the last ten years than in the previous fifty; But the new innovations rocking the field have not fully expressed themselves in the marketplace: It is not yet widely understood that you can have teeth in a day or crowns in an hour; or that Invisalign really works. Patients don't yet know about Laser-Assisted New Attachment Procedure (LANAP), a $100,000 laser that regrows bone so that they don't need to have surgery.

The latest technology is mostly undiscovered by today's dental patient; but that won't be true for long: And once patients recognize that there are tools to make things faster and better, they're not going to tolerate archaic processes. Once they know, you can't take that knowledge away from them. Technology, limited hours, and inconvenience will become unacceptable, just as they have for every other product and service that people use.
---
# WHAT THE PRACTICE OF TOMORROW WILL LOOK LIKE

There are a lot of people who think this is the end of the solo practice, because all this modern technology costs a lot of money: They say there's no way a single practicing dentist can afford to have all this stuff—the bells and whistles, the x-ray equipment; the convenient hours unless he or she is together with other providers. You can't be open from eight to eight as a single provider: You can't have the iTero scanner; the CEREC machine, and the CT scanner as one doctor.

I do believe that you'll have to work your tail off if you want to be a viable solo practitioner in the future. You'll have to get creative. You'll have to think of your practice like a business:

# Peter's Take

I believe the middle class is going to be eliminated in dentistry. There is going to be an abundance of both high-end and low-end providers, with little to nothing in between:

Future competition will occur in economies of scale, and therefore, dentists will have to band together: That may mean working with specialists or niching out and working beneath the umbrella of general dentistry, as Craig and I do.

Right now, the systems in dentistry are a little bit broken. The conveniences that have been ushered into every aspect of society haven't had a big impact on dentistry so far: The profession remains plagued by paperwork, phone calls, and referrals for procedures that require multiple trips to different.

offices. The more convenient society becomes as a whole, the less shit like that will fly: Just as Amazon Prime is killing retail, the multispecialty convenient office has the potential to kill the solo practitioner: Why?

Because right now, more than at any other point in history, societal leverage is all about time. That's why podcasts are experiencing hockey-stick growth right now; they allow you to leverage your time: Videos are actually getting less play, believe it or not. We have so many interactions, so many things to do, an incredible influx of distractions coming at us every single day:

Our preference for text and email over phone calls—avenues that allow us to respond on our own terms—is just one clue about the ways our minds are shifting: If small practices don't follow suit and make things high-tech and low-cost or high-tech and high value, then we're dead in the water:

The fact that the disruption hasn't happened yet speaks to that barrier to entry inherent to dentistry that we addressed in the previous chapter: not everyone can be a dentist: There's a scarcity there, and that means we have a little more control. But the field is truly ripe for disruption, and the second technology is out there, our consumers realize that the days of making people jump through hoops to get treatment are over: No more endless paperwork, cumbersome procedures, or shuttling you across town through traffic to see my buddy.

# The Digital Revolution Is Coming to Dentistry

Moores Law refers to an observation about semiconductors. Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel, noticed that the number of transistors per square inch had doubled every year; and then every two years, since their invention. What he was recognizing was the exponential growth of technology:

Once dentistry hits the digital platform, it can scale at a macro level, and that's when things get crazy. As systems become digital, they eventually become democratized and demonetized. Dentistry has always been such a direct exchange, dictated by the doctor: my time, my hands; your procedure. But once the workflow becomes digital, everything will become cheap and robotic; think $99 crowns installed and cemented, that kind of shit. It'll happen; mark our words: People cherish time and convenience, and they won’t make an exception for dentistry:

Look at what happened to the lab industry, which went completely digital. There used to be an art to creating teeth out of powdered porcelain and water: That art is lost. Now even the most highly trained technicians are doing monolithic milled restorations. The art is reduced to maybe 5 percent of the work because it can all be done at scale. We will be held to the same meritocratic standards as the taxi, retail, and

movie-rental industries that have been disrupted or destroyed by Uber; Amazon, and Netflix

Now patients come in with photos of what they want; they don't want to be shown limitless options. You can have a catalog of fifty teeth, or even twenty, because the paradox of choice - the idea that the more choices you have, the less happy you are - applies here too. With today's technology, you can import that into a patient's smile, try it on the patients within an hour; and they can decide whether they want to buy:

Plus, people are used to accessing this kind of technology: Snapchat filters allow people to see themselves in any number of ways. If they're not doing it already, patients are soon going to come to your office with that expectation too: "Well; just put that smile on me; let me see what it looks like." It's no different from seeing themselves in the funny hat, flower crown, or doe eyes that Snapchat can add to their photos or videos.

Dentistry's saving grace to date has been the fact that the public doesn't yet know there's a better mousetrap out there: But when they find out - and they will - they're gonna be pissed. When people come to Craig's office and get a crown in a day, they tell him how the other dentists made them wait two weeks and that they had to come back twice because their temporary had fallen out: They're not happy that their time has been wasted unnecessarily:

They’re going to start demanding this stuff, and those who deliver it will win. You won’t be able to rest on your laurels or on just being really good with your hands.

In a hospital setting, you are not permitted to do non-standard of care procedures. No one is doing knee replacements as they used to by slicing legs open and leaving nine-inch scars behind; it’s all arthroscopic. LANAP is an FDA-approved modality to regrow bone that doesn’t require any cutting. People don’t want sutures when they don’t have to have them.

But since dentistry has been dominated by solo practices to date, and practices—and their patients are often siloed, it’s been easy to keep innovations like LANAP from patients. So far, we’ve been pretty good at deceiving the public. When Invisalign first came out, every doctor who didn’t do it just said, “It’s bullshit; you’re not a candidate.” That worked for about a decade; but now, with websites like RealSelf which provides real reviews of different procedures, products, and practitioners—you can actually see unretouched before-and-after pictures. Patients can say to themselves, “Shit, my teeth aren’t as bad as that chick’s, and look at how well it worked for her.” With so much easily accessible information there, patients will come in knowing what they want and what’s best for them.

Today, patients are driving Craig's decisions about purchasing, training, everything.

They'll ask for it; and if they can't get it, they won't be afraid to go elsewhere: The days of "I don't know, whatever you think, Doc; are vanishing: gone or at least.

# The Practice of the Future

Societal demands are catching up with dentistry: We're very aware of the rapid advance of technology: If you're not paying attention to it and if you're not innovating, you’re in a dangerous place: For example, China just developed a robot that can place dental implants with far greater accuracy than we can manually:

This stuff is real now. We've seen technology that's so disruptive, it's eerie. After reviewing the first X-ray he took after doing LANAP; Craig made his assistant take four more because he thought the X-ray machine was broken; the bone had regenerated that well: If you had come in three months before he got the machine, he would have told you that he had to take out two or three of your teeth: Now the dentist or periodontist waves a silly little light around and doesn’t even touch the patient. No cutting, no sutures, and the bone regrows. Technology is changing the world;

# WHAT THE PRACTICE OF TOMORROW WILL LOOK LIKE

What does the practice of the future look like? Is it all high-tech toys and robots? That's definitely part of it: But at its core, the practice of the future will be one that:

- a) Focuses on maximizing patients' time
- b) Makes it super easy to get care
- Creates the most value for patients while they're in the office

If you focus on those three objectives and reverse engineer your practice from there; with those ideals as your guiding principles, you'll win.

But if you keep telling yourself it's going to stay the same way it's always been you may as well pack it up. If you don't want to do all that - if you don't want to add the value of convenience, if you don't want to embrace technology - that's OK - but others are going to, and they're going to eat your lunch.

If you're reading this book and you're sixty-eight years old, are these new developments going to sink your business? Probably not, because you've built thirty, forty years of relationships. But at a certain point, things will change: If your patients love YOU, maybe they'll go to you for cleanings sometimes, but they'll choose someone else for more technical procedures.

What should you do? First, don't let fear paralyze you or prevent you from advancing: Instead, focus on becoming aware of what's happening around you - and what's going on.

to happen: You don't have to do everything that's out there but it's important to find ways to provide the biggest value proposition to your consumer:

You can't be open all hours of the day: You can't have all the latest and greatest toys. But you can figure out how to set yourself apart: And although things are shifting from a convenience standpoint, people still perceive the value of all the other stuff we discussed in chapters one through nine: Technology doesn't negate that; it just enhances it. Developing vision, tracking your goals, creating an inspiring culture for your team and patients alike none of that requires a fancy machine. You can start there.

Even though patients value technology and convenience, they're still human beings, and in the end, human beings value relationships. Maybe fifty years from now patients will be seen by actual robots, but until then, there's going to have to be someone in the office - a smiling face making them feel comfortable and confident: You can do that: You can do more than you think.

This is the best time to be practicing: The wave of innovation and change is coming, but that just means it's time to grab your fucking surfboard. If you do, you'll be on the beach having cocktails in no time: We'll see you there:
