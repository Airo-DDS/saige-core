# SDC's MISSION STATEMENT

We as a dental team feel called to create an atmosphere conducive to helping people *feel* good about themselves, allowing them the freedom to explore choices for taking greater responsibility for their own health.

We wish to convey that our office is committed to the total well-being of our patients and, as such, we are *sensitive* to their emotional, spiritual and physical health needs and we respond *positively*.

We feel led to provide a pleasant environment conducive to learning at each individual own pace and recognize that their aspirations of health may be different from those of our own.

We feel rewarded if we can contribute to and empower our patients to lead a higher quality of life through a mutual exchange of something of *value*.

We pledge to constantly strive to provide a service with greater technical and behavioral excellence through a continual process of *learning*.

We realize that we are *teachers*, not healers; that we are vehicles through which healing can take place by awakening "the doctor within", that no meaningful change can be affected in people unless we provide intimacy and long-term relationships.

Accordingly, since our influence can only be helpful in this "feeling" context, we are committed to becoming better feelers and relators. If our help is to be meaningful, we realize that we as a health care team must reflect a health-centered lifestyle in *appearance, attitude and action*.

We realize that life itself is a constant series of choices and our choices determine not only our health but ultimately the very quality of our lives. Our aim then, is to support our patients in making informed choices concerning their oral, physical and spiritual health that will *enhance* the quality and quantity of their lives by being in harmony with their values.

In short, we want to be a transformed, nurturing and profitable health-centered practice based on trust, integrity, commitment, service and excellence, and have *fun* while we do this!

# Hygiene Tips

## 1) EDUCATION
* We are not just 'cleaning' teeth
* We are here to educate: OHI, prevention is the key!
* Pt's should feel that they have learned something new to help with their hygiene
* Be DR'S ADVOCATE, DR's extra pair of eyes

## 2) FL VARNISH
* Go over risk factors, and why patients need it
* ALWAYS let patient know regarding the fee for it ($48)
* FL varnish is usually not covered thru insurance
* Educate pts regarding to it
    - Extra Armor
    - Kills decay causing bacteria
    - Seam of crown, fills
    - Fl absorb to teeth and make them stronger
    - Apply on kids all the time
    - ADA came out with long term study that shows it helps adults as well
    - Being PROACTIVE THAN REACTIVE

## 3) ROUTING SLIPS
* Make addition/deletion accordingly

## 4) BE ON TIME
* DR will come in half-hour past the appointment

## 5) EXAM SUMMARY EXPECTATIONS
* Hygiene Hand-off
* IOPs and CO-DIAGNOSES done
* IF FL varnish, explanation is done and placed on the cart (cue for DR)
* Explanation for Large filling stress fractures
    - hot/cold, different material, expand/shrink
    - Stress fractures
    - Tooth is SPLITING from inside/out
    - Prevent the tooth to completely fracture/split
    - Image show of split molar - Karen calls the tooth $6k tooth - implant
    - Protect the tooth by putting a crown
    - Being Proactive not Reactive

## 6) CO-DIAGNOSIS
* DR will help DEVELOP the skills and DEVELOP to be another pair of DR's eyes, be DR's ADVOCATE

# GOAL

We are clinical providers; we have a responsibility to EDUCATE our patients to help them improve their oral hygiene at home and inform them regarding their oral conditions and help them prevent any future catastrophic failures and disease.

Think of yourself as a POWERFUL EDUCATORS and not just a provider who is doing a service/treatment.

EXPECTATION: Be the #1 educators of our practice as you see more patients, and seeing them frequent helps them improve their health of their oral conditions, hence that will help their overall health!

## FAQ's

- Xrays and Full Mouth Probing? Alternating

- Why Exam, Xrays, Fl Varnish often?
  Explain we focus on preventative and we are trying to keep our patients' teeth and gums health by providing preventative therapeutic benefits.

- NP/SRP/4M Recall
  - Get to know immediate family medical history of patients (learn about genetic clues)
  - "John, I like to know about your family's medical history – the reason we want to know that today is because we now know that there is a connection between the health of the mouth and your overall health. Is it ok if I ask questions regarding your family's history?"
  - Among their blood relatives/family members – is there any history of family having:
    - Heart Disease
    - Diabetes
    - Stroke
    - Cancer
    - Early Term Birth
  - FIVE disease that have direct/causative link to periodontal disease
  - If they say YES to one of them, inform "John, because there is history in your family of these disease that is being tied with health of your gums – I WANT TO BE A SPECIAL WATCHFUL FOR YOU. Therefore we are going to do a very thorough exam of your gums today, because of the risk factors you have in your family to help avoid any potential risk of infection"
  - As we help patients gain better oral health, we are actually enhancing their overall health, perhaps SAVING their lives – these FIVE diseases are SERIOUS
  - We are saving lives by intervention and helping patient have better oral health which leads to better overall health
  - 4mm or more with BOP → PERIO DIESEASE

# Educating need of SRP to Patient

"John, I am concerned, you have an INFECTION in your gums. Infection isn't just in the mouth, there are pathogenic bacteria's that is causing this infection and is circulating throughout your circulating system. We know a lot more today about how health of teeth and gums affect the OVERALL health. If not taken care of, these pathogenic bacteria may increase the likelihood to cause inflammatory systemic diseases"

If they do not understand or move forward with recommended txt after the dialogue, you can say:

"John, can I ask you a question? Can we agree, if you don't make some change its not going to get better by itself? That infection in your gums is not going to get better by itself? Lets have you use water pik, this will implement a different modality and we will see you in 3M and see how that helped?" This may help bring positive change.

Encourage patients to add/change a modality (power tooth brush, waterpik, etc) to help them do something different

Inform patient, you hope they utilize that modality and we will check those pocket numbers and BOP when he comes next time (3 months), we will able to establish a baseline to compare to and we are hoping to see some POSITIVE change

If they don't utilize any modality, then we can give small sample size of ORACARE with syringe tip – and show them how to use it. Say if you use this faithfully as a part of home care then next time when you come in- I am goin to take the same data and will see how you doing and hopefully we see some progress

When they come in – the pocket depts and BOP will not significantly change but improve, however the infection is still there. I am concerned that you need periodontal therapy/SRP – sometimes when 2ⁿᵈ time they hear it – they will accept it – if not change the modality (change to toothbrush or waterpik or monojet/Oracare)

No need to be "hardass" when patients don't accept it. If they don't accept it, then we don't do SRP and release them from our Practice – try to work with them and once they hear over and over and see you are willing to work with them – they will change – its hard for people to accept CHANGE.

Getting them there by taking BABY STEPS

THINK OF PROGRESS NOT PERFECTION!!!

# Recommending Fluoride Varnish

These recommendations are based on the ADA's updated report on Clinical Practice Guidelines for Topical Fluoride Application. Here are some key points (on fluoride varnish only) and there is a great chairside tool that can be used to determine if and when fluoride application would be beneficial:

- Patients whose caries risk is low, as defined in the document, may not receive additional benefit from professional topical fluoride application.

- Fluoride varnish applied every six months is effective in preventing caries in the primary and permanent dentitions of children and adolescents.

- Two or more applications of fluoride varnish per year are effective in preventing caries in high-risk populations.

- Low risk is defined as "No incipient or cavitated primary or secondary carious lesions during the last three years and no factors that may increase caries risk."

- Moderate risk as "One or two incipient or cavitated primary or secondary carious lesions in the last three years. No incipient or cavitated primary or secondary carious lesions in the last three years but presence of at least one factor that may increase caries risk."

- High risk was defined as "Three or more incipient or cavitated primary or secondary carious lesions in the last three years. Presence of multiple factors that may increase caries risk.

- Hypersensitivity

## Risk Factors that should be assessed:

- Xerostomia
- Exposed roots
- Cariogenic diet
- Eating disorders
- Poor oral hygiene
- Drug or alcohol abuse
- Orthodontic treatment
- Chemotherapy or radiation therapy
- Developmental or acquired enamel defects
- Plaque-retentive, multisurface restorations

# Connecting With Patients and Making them feel at HOME

- Ask Open-ended questions

  - Most people enjoy talking about themselves because it is easy. Open ended questions generate conversation and encourage the patient to open up. Start by asking how their day is going, what they have planned for the weekend. If they start talking about a baseball game they are going to ask about it further - does their grandchild play? Is it their son? Is it the Saltdogs? Do they go to a lot of Saltdogs games? Add in something personal about yourself too, - "Oh I haven't ever been to a Saltdogs game, I'll have to go!"

  - The more you talk to your patient, the more you'll learn about them and connect. It will make their next visit that much more enjoyable!

- Practice Active Listening

  - It's easy to tune out as a patient is talking, but you'll make a much stronger connection if you pay attention to them and engage. Ask relevant questions to keep the conversation going.

- Show Enthusiasm

  - Small talk will come easy to some and is more challenging for others. Like anything, practice makes perfect. It is OK to have the same conversation with every patient you encounter. If that makes it easy and more manageable for you personally, do it!

  - View patient conversations as an opportunity to learn more about people. You never know who you will meet or what they'll share with you that may be interesting and entertaining!

# HYGIENE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES

"Adjunctive" refers to any treatment or service that is provided in conjunction with another to increase the first treatment's efficacy. In other words, adjunctive is a secondary treatment in addition to the primary therapy.

| CONDITIONS | THERAPY |
| - | - |
| Occlusal and Cervical Enamel Wear - Abfractions, Abrasions - Bruxism (Clenching and Grinding) | Occlusal Guard |
| Yellow Teeth - Young Patients and Old Age, Slow and sustained Release (overnight) | Whitening Trays |
| Sensitive Teeth - Cold Air at Root, Hypersensitive Dentin - Light-cured protective sealant - Protects tooth from bacteria and unexpected contamination to dentin | Root Desensitizing Medicament |
| Caries Risk Patients - Root Exposure, Acid Reflux - Ongoing Chemo/Radiation therapy - Current Ortho Patient - SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL TO PREVENT CAVITIES AND RE-MINERALIZE TOOTH SURFACES | Fluoride Varnish |
| Perio Risk Patients - Periodisease Patients - SRP, PMT Patients - Bleeding Gums, Plaque Reduction - Bad Breath, Dry Mouth - Canker and Cold Sores | ORACARE Prescription Rinse |
| High Caries Risk - Multiple Restorations in the past 1-2 years - Ongoing Chemo/Radiation therapy - Sensodyne/Arm\&Hammer Toothpaste not working | FLUORIDEX Prescription Toothpaste |
| Perio Risk Patients - SRP, PMT, 3-4M borderline prophy pts - Kills bacteria that might be introduced into bloodstream - Increases blood circulation at the bottom of the pocket for healing | Laser Light Therapy |

---
# 3-4M Recare Interval

- NO BLOODY PROPHYS (blood - sign of infection)
- This pts have infection, and that is not going to resolve on its own - they need INTERVENTION - need to get their oral health in control
- Pts that have recession, lots of restorations
- Research has shown that bacterial colonies multiply every 3-4months and going in there will help disrupt those colonies and prevent gum disease and tooth decay
- Research has shown, Gum infection causing bacterias such as P. Gingivalis repopulate every 3-4 months, we bring pts in during those time to disturb the gum infection causing bacteria
- For long time and still, insurances likes to dictate treatment and cover 2x/year - but we like to take care of our patients oral health at optimum and have seen that seeing patients every 3/4 months helps long term. 2x/year cleaning is not enough

- Explanation to patient: Doing great job above the gums, but these bacterias reside in the pocket between the gums and the teeth, and they hide in nooks and cleaning every 3-4 months will help disrupt those colonies.
- There are three phases: HEALTHY-INBETWEEN-DISEASE and you are in-between and we want to move towards healthy phase and this is a PROCESS - it doesnt
---
resolve overnight - we work together and bring your
oral health back to healthy

Implants, Invisalign, Braces Patients - 3-4M
cleanings - Disruption of bacteria - PREVENTATIVE
CARE

## ORAL SYSTEMIC LINK
******************

- We will expand our discussion of oral systemic
link: letting our patients know that there is
increasing evidence ANY level of sustained oral
inflammation can impact either active disease or
those at risk...family history. Most notable: heart
disease, diabetes, Rheumatoid arthritis, any
inflammatory disease.

-Research has identified pathogenic bacteria that
can occur in the mouth are not only associated with
these diseases, but if present can make the disease
worse or increase the likelihood that if there is a
susceptibility (family history), the disease will
have a higher probability of occurring.

# Instructions For Gum Therapy Patients (SRP)

To minimize the discomfort and aid proper healing following your deep cleaning, we suggest the following:

1. After the procedure, take aspirin, Tylenol (acetaminophen), or Advil (ibuprofen) before the anesthetic wears off. Continue to take one tablet every four hours for the next two days.

2. Rinse with a warm salt-water solution (mix ½ teaspoon salt in 8 oz. warm water) two or three times an hour for the next day or two.

3. Use a soft toothbrush at least two times a day. Be gentle and clean thoroughly. Slight bleeding may occur while brushing as the tissues begin to heal.

4. Avoid strong spicy seasonings, and hard "chippy" for the next few days.

5. As the tissues heal, some sensitivity to cold may occur. Use a desensitizing toothpaste (such as Sensodyne or Denquil), or fluoride gel (such as Prevident or Gel-Kam) frequently (at least 4 times/day) for 1 to 2 weeks. Also, the cleaner the teeth are kept, the less sensitive they will be.

6. Faithfully use any other oral hygiene aids that have been recommended (floss, Perio-Aid, rubber tip, Sonicare, Proxabrush, Gel-Kam fluoride, Peridex mouthrinse, etc).

7. Refrain from smoking for 24 hours or longer. Tobacco interferes with healing.

8. If you have any questions or concerns, please call our office.
